Right. First, you would choose to believe this 'information' referenced as fact, yet if you really look at the reported ""evidence"", there are far more questions than answers.

*Especially*, considering all the parties involved (and potentially), and the questionable evidence presented, one rule of thumb is ""don't believe anyone"". They're all liars until absolute fact can be established.

58,"Trump/Israel/Saudis became interested in keeping the status quo, once they implemented sanctions.  Let me be clear.

Trump/Israel/Saudis weren't satisfied with the Iran Deal, because Iran was using the funds to wage proxy wars in Syria/Yemen/Iraq against Saudi/Israeli/American interests.  So, Israel/Saudis supported Trump, and helped him get elected.

Once Trump changed the status quo to Iran being Crippled by Sanctions... The Saudis/Israelis/Trump became satisfied with the Status Quo that currently exists.  War is not something the Saudis/Israelis/USA are interested in, because it gives Iran a chance to change the status quo in their favor.

Similarly, Iran was satisfied with the Status Quo of the Iran deal.  Once Trump got rid of the deal, and instituted Sanctions, Iran stopped being okay with the Status Quo.

So, now the USA/Saudis/Israel are satisfied with the way things are.  As long as Iran can't draw them into a war, Iran will slowly be strangled, and become less and less powerful(which will turn the tides of the whole middle east).  

Iran, knowing this, is doing ANYTHING IT CAN to change the status quo.  Because Europe wouldn't capitulate to Iran's demands of giving them a better deal, to make up for the USA leaving the deal... Iran has no diplomatic options, besides coming back to the table, and taking a worse deal.  Iran isn't willing to do that.  So, the only card Iran still has up its sleeve is to start blowing stuff up, to either force the USA into a war, and beat them, or, scare USA/Europe into realizing that a war with Iran will mean tens of millions of Europeans/Americans/Saudis/Israelis killed.",0.10670289855072464,positive,Iran Sanctions,0.5533514492753623,positive

Have you read the agreement? Of course not, because if you had, you would realise Iran is not violating the agreement. It is within its rights to stop some of its commitments if the other signatories do not uphold theirs, which is exactly what happened.

Article 36 of the JCPOA

> If Iran believed that any or all of the E3/EU+3 were not meeting their commitments under this JCPOA, Iran could refer the issue to the Joint Commission for resolution; similarly, if any of the E3/EU+3 believed that Iran was not meeting its commitments under this JCPOA, any of the E3/EU+3 could do the same. The Joint Commission would have 15 days to resolve the issue, unless the time period was extended by consensus. After Joint Commission consideration, any participant could refer the issue to Ministers of Foreign Affairs, if it believed the compliance issue had not been resolved. Ministers would have 15 days to resolve the issue, unless the time period was extended by consensus. After Joint Commission consideration – in parallel with (or in lieu of) review at the Ministerial level - either the complaining participant or the participant whose performance is in question could request that the issue be considered by an Advisory Board, which would consist of three members (one each appointed by the participants in the dispute and a third independent member). The Advisory Board should provide a non-binding opinion on the compliance issue within 15 days. If, after this 30-day process the issue is not resolved, the Joint Commission would consider the opinion of the Advisory Board for no more than 5 days in order to resolve the issue. **If the issue still has not been resolved to the satisfaction of the complaining participant, and if the complaining participant deems the issue to constitute significant nonperformance, then that participant could treat the unresolved issue as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part and/or notify the UN Security Council that it believes the issue constitutes significant non-performance.**

Europe and the US have both failed to live up to their commitments, the issue has not yet been resolved and its been a lot longer than 15 days. There is a clear case of significant non-performance on Europe and Americas behalf. Iran has not seen any of the benefits that were promised as part of the deal. Therefore, Iran is within its rights to drop its commitments in whole or in part, while still remaining in the JCPOA.

>Soon after the agreement was signed, U.S. Congress control changed to the Republican Party, who did not support the agreement. Some Republican Senators were strongly against the agreement, regarding it as appeasement. Initially, U.S. Department of Defense emergency funds not under Congress' control were used to fund the transitional oil supplies under the agreement, together with international funding. From 1996 Congress provided funding, though not always sufficient amounts. Consequently, some of the agreed transitional oil supplies were delivered late. KEDO's first director, Stephen Bosworth, later commented ""The Agreed Framework was a political orphan within two weeks after its signature"".

Cuba has arguably one of the richest democratic processes of all of our civilized nations. They dont spy on their people. What they do is keep privately owned media out so that bs propaganda doesnt infiltrate the minds of their young. One could argue that state controlled media is a form of oppression, but if we look at our own media, they are own by the same 6 entities thanks to the telecommunications act under Bill Clinton's presidency. These 6 entities control everything in our media and they are closely aligned with out oligarchic overloards' interests. Further, one could look at the unfortunate moment in history when Socialist Chilean president allowed media to be wholly free (libre) and it  was used to spew lies and incredibly shady/false propaganda against him and his party which aided in the coup against him on september 11, 1973.

Your definition of ""jurisdiction"" doesn't make sense. A court is part of the judicial branch of the government. This means that they're the ones deciding the punishment. It's the executive branch of the government that enforces that punishment.

If having the power to enforce the punishment is part of the definition of jurisdiction, then a court could never have jurisdiction over a case because a court doesn't have the power to punish anyone. This means according to you it can only be a government that has jurisdiction, because only a government has both judicial and executive branch.

All you're doing is trying to twist the meaning of ""jurisdiction"", just google the definition of it and you'll realize that literally none of them talk about any enforcement.

The ICJ has jurisdiction over the case and this is a fact. You're trying to use semantics to change the meaning of a word in order to say that the ICJ doesn't have ""jurisdiction"" over the case, which doesn't make sense at all. I don't understand what your goal is in this discussion?

This is the most detailed definition I've found:

> Power or right of a legal or political agency to exercise its authority over a person, subject matter, or territory. Jurisdiction over a person relates to the authority to try him or her as a defendant. Jurisdiction over a subject matter relates to authority derived from the country's constitution or laws to consider a particular case. Jurisdiction over a territory relates to the geographic area over which a court has the authority to decide cases. Concurrent jurisdiction exists where two courts have simultaneous responsibility for the same case. [Source](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/jurisdiction.html)

I constantly see this hypocritical stance taken by Russia and China, that make enormous internal regulations and punitive actions not against just coporations, but entire countries that recognize Taiwan, or individuals that visit with the Dalai Lama.

For instance the Russian federation requires all data for Russian citizens the world over to be first installed on Russian servers. This means any Russian citizen, operating in any country, anywhere.

Their mechanism for enforcing this is taking punitive action towards companies that do not follow these data retention policies when they operate within the Russian federation.

My point is sanctions are just market based regulations and penalties, and other countries are capable of (and do) levy similar regulations and penalties on U.S companies in their own markets based on their own internal laws, and have the right and sovereignty to do so.

>But punishing via an unilateral legal system people for not following through what they decided is bullying national sovereignty, and blackmailing nations.

It is definitely bullying and blackmail, but it's not imperialism.

Indeed, Ahmadinejad threatened to ""wipe Israel off the map,"" and just one month ago an Iranian general said the same.

Yes, knowlage of one is important for the other, but no nation has devloped nuclear bombs from nuclear power plants. All nations that have both have started with nuclear weapons and then made use of it to produce energy.

All nuclear experts agree that it is pretty dumb and useless to use modern nuclear power plants to produce weapons materials. No nation has ever taken that path and no nation will. If you want nuclear materials then making a plan to take it out of commercial reactor that is monitored is about the dumbest possible plan.

Iran had been willing to buy these reactors from France and France would have had full view of the whole fuel cycle in order to make sure that this was not used for anything else. Iran was at that time and since also abserved under the NPT. If there was still any credible worry, for a deal with the US Iran would have adopted the extend protocol as well (as they latter did in the Obama deal).

Under this arrangment Iran would not even have devloped the capability to make weapons grade materials but the US of course blocked it anyway.

Please learn something about the history of Iran and Israel. For the most part the nations were frindly for a long time, even until the late 1980. We do actually have data about public opinion and the Iranian people don't have a really strong opinion on Israel, far less then Arabs. Most experts also agree that the Iranian elites as a whole are not perticularly anti-semitic. There is not really a true idiological thread, depending on the politics of the day the play the thread up and down on both sides. 

Ahmadinejad is guy with a big mouth that was put foreward by the regimn to scare the west and make the west think that Iran is crazy. He said stupid and crazy stuff for the same reason Trump says stupid stuff. Its simple populist politics. 

> So there you go, a government which recently developed high-range missiles, and who wants to ""wipe Israel off the face of the map,"" is in perfect position to do so if they are allowed to use nuclear power without the plutonium being collected.

Please learn how nukes work. You can't simply stick the plutonium from the reactor waste stream on a bomb and fire it. It requires a siginifacnt amount of further work that is very difficult to hide. Also, all these materials would be continuly monitored by the IAEA.

Also, Saudi Arabia has said they would take the war into Iran. If you think Iran is not allowed to have missiles because of what they said, why are the Saudis allowed?

Iran need missiles for defense, as has been proven in the Iran-Iraq war where they were hit by missiles and were unable to do anything. This included chemical gas attacks on civilian.

How can you argue that they don't have a credible argument for defensive missile threat when they are surounded by powers, some hostile, who all have these missiles.

Iran is a shitty regime but they keep largely to themselves. Saudi Arabia on the other hand is exporting its brand of violent wahabism everywhere from the ME to west Asia, Africa, Oceania, Europe.

Very true. There is good reason to go to college, but many in my generation are flawed in allowing or persuading their children to go to school for something that won't produce income after graduation. Also, allowing their kids to go to school in places they simply can't afford while there *are* affordable options out there. The other aspect is that many parents don't see the problems in their kids early enough to know that places like UF have a 41% dropout rate. College has become a finishing school/half way house for the real world for lazy parenting. 

> Problem is, kids don't find this out until after they've paid $30k for a degree and have little job prospects.

Very true again.. Well, that is the average millennial debt, but the actual college debt is a much higher sub set. 

> However, your assertion that ""9/10 choose to put themselves in debt"" is silly

Is it? Credit card debt, student loans, car payments and home mortgages are the top categories for millennials being in debt.. actually, that sort of the same for previous generations, different order sometimes, but same categories. 

The average millennial makes $35,000 a year? (Was surprised by this). So, at some point, someone either didn't do the math to figure out they can't afford that car, that college, that x,y,z or ignored the fact for a later day.

Anecdotally, I mentioned UF earlier; I visited my daughter there several times. I was amazed by the amount of high end stores, restaurants, apartments in the area. Couldn't help but think, there's no way a college kid could afford to eat or shop at these places.. but everywhere we went, we were the only parents and the rest was college students paying with credit cards. I often viewed my daughters facebook/instagram and see her friends that she grew up with going everywhere on Gods green earth on holiday.. I ask, how can they afford this, I know their parents, they can't afford that?? Is it credit cards? Nope, I was told, it's student loan money; what doesn't get used for school ends up back in the students bank account.. so and so actually put a big chunk of his student loan overage on an A4.. Again, anecdotally, but I am sure there are some stats out there about college costs vs. student loan debt that would show this is a larger problem. And don't forget, millennial's biggest debt is credit cards and at the same time, half of that subset are college oriented

I guess where this whole conversation is going is what to do.. there are several cultural things (better guidance by parents, teachers) that need to change, for sure, that would prevent a lot of millennial debt. There are things that the government should do to step in (outlaw predatory practices) and things they shouldn't do.. Largely, the fact that tuition is so high is due to government backed loans (different conversation), it's never good to ask the government for help.

What I see here is there are bad **decisions** by both parents and students on top of predatory practices by student loan and credit card companies. But I will always say this is a personal responsibility. Society cannot be responsible for your decisions, you are.. just as you are responsible for getting yourself out of the situations you put yourself in. When I hear conversations about millennial's having high debt, unable to pay it off, I worry the next part of the conversation is what leftists have already started which is - debt forgiveness. What they really mean is higher taxes or shifting it to our national debt.

1454,"I think the most frustrating thing for a lot of sub-median income is this assumption that they aren't ""living within their means"". Heck, even for people who make fairly high above the median income. Average millennial makes $35k: take out taxes (15% = ~$5K roughly), rent ($7-10K/year if you're near any big city for a basic room), food ($2k/year), and then health insurance (variable). That leaves you with 10-15K/year, if everything goes perfect, for anything else including: a car/car payments & insurance, any incidentals, any accidents or bad luck, gas, etc. At the end of the day, there's little room to pay off any student loan debt or credit card debt. A lot of people find themselves in similar situations post-grad, and if they don't have Mom or Dad to help them out by living at home or whatever, it's going to take forever to pay off $20-100K+ of debt at a 6% annual interest rate. 

But I don't blame these people. Yes, there is probably a large group of people that just poorly managed their money in college/post-grad and were financially irresponsible. But from what I've seen, it's mostly the kids of parents from the middle class who find themselves in this situation. Rich enough help their kid out in college and encourage them to get a good education because they think it will lead to better things, but not rich enough to fully support their tuition costs. And no school counselor, parent, or teacher ever really told these kids exactly what they would face if they went for that art, literature, science, etc degree. And how could you expect a 16-17 y.o. to know that on their own? It's the system and the older generation that is initially failing these kids and putting them in a tough spot to begin with. How they handle it afterwards it up to them though. 

On top of that, tuition has been rising at criminal rates the last 2 decades, far outpacing inflation and damn near everything else. This only leads to an ever increasing problem. As to what to about student loan debt? There's not really a good answer. I think free/subsidized higher education would be nice, but we would need a socialistic system that worked at a grander, more organized scale. Which will likely never happen in the US. I think loan forgiveness is probably our best bet unless we regulate tuition prices, but instead of handing out loan forgiveness like candy, use it to encourage professionals to work in underprivileged/developing areas. That will further boost the economy of those areas and allow them to grow into larger populations. 

Sorry for the long post, but my two cents. I agree with you that you're responsible for your decisions, however, I hope you can agree with me that expecting high school kids to plan their financial future is slightly absurd. That burden should fall on society (i.e. parents, school systems, colleges themselves, etc.) to make kids aware of the risks and cost/benefit of their choices. Which they don't.

 Also, anecdotally for me: going to UGA, which I would consider similar to UF as a large, state college. Most people swiping their credit cards left and right are almost always using their parents accounts. There are ample amounts of kids from well-to-do families at those big state, college footballs schools. I've known people and acknowledge there are those out there who abuse student loans and spend it like crazy, but I assure you they are the minority.

1484,"The charge appears to be business fraud, not violation of US sanctions on Iran, *per se*.

Financial institutions are always quite attentive to the risks of working with other companies, especially if the risks concern legal and regulatory compliance. In this case, the allegation is that certain US financial institutions were lied to by Huawei (and Wanzhou Meng personally) about the nature of Huawei's dealings with Iran.

Contrary to common reporting, it is not a violation of US sanctions to do business in Iran in many areas (including consumer telecommunications), nor is it a violation of US sanctions to do business with another non-US business that does business in Iran in non-sanctioned areas. US sanctions are mostly in the nuclear, weapons, oil, transport and financial industries -- but there is a complex web of different laws, regulations and executive orders which makes the whole thing difficult to sort through at best. The added complexity of making sure that a company's activities strictly fall outside the bounds of the sanctions (and the risk of violating them, even inadvertently), has put off many companies from doing any business with Iran as a blanket rule, as Iran is a small enough market that the benefits do not outweigh the costs and the risks.

Huawei sought funding from US institutions. When those institutions asked about Huawei's businesses in Iran, they were allegedly lied to. Had they known the truth, they may well not have entered into those financial transactions, because ensuring compliance with the sanctions is risky and cumbersome. Thus, Huawei's dealings with those financial institutions were fradulent, according to the allegations.

Though politically, this might seem like the US is just trying to block Huawei's expansion by any means possible, the simple fact is that (if the allegations are true), Huawei chose to do business in Iran, knew that also doing business with American companies at the same time would be a headache, and then tried to cover up its Iranian dealings. This cover-up was the crime -- not the dealings in Iran themselves, which by my reading was perfectly legal for Huawei to do, as long as they stayed away from certain industries and persons.",0.09275210084033614,positive,Iran Sanctions,0.546376050420168,positive

1971,"Oh, so now we're moving the goal post from ""give a month's notice"" to ""weak points of the deal"".

Even so, you didn't even read your own article! The point of the article is that they NOW have access to military sites, something IAEA never had. And if the Trump Administration revokes the agreement, it'll be worse.

>""The IAEA has never had better access to Iran's military sites,"" says Vaez. ""If the Trump administration loses this unprecedented access ... it will soon wish for it.""

>Vaez adds that derailing the JCPOA now could also have unintended consequences.

>""If the Trump administration kills the deal with Iran, [a deal] that is working and [that] the rest of the international community is highly satisfied with,"" he says, ""it should forget about peacefully settling the nuclear standoff with North Korea.""

That's the debate the article is talking about. Removing the deal would mean IAEA goes back to being dark about what goes on in Iran.

On the point of the 24-days, that would be for military sites that the IAEA would have concerns about:

>He also has said that inspectors need a reason to request access to undeclared sites, and the JCPOA section on access states that ""if the IAEA has concerns [emphasis added] regarding undeclared nuclear materials or activities,"" then it can request to see undeclared — i.e., military — sites. It's unclear what kind of reason or evidence the IAEA would consider sufficient.

If you want to say the agreement needs work, fine. The IAEA heads say that too:

>“There’s room to provide us with more proactive and timely cooperation,” Yukiya Amano, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s director general, said Monday in Vienna.

But he also says there's no ""concern"" (keyword here), and there always room for improvement:

>“I am not saying we have any concerns. The agency has conducted complementary accesses to all the sites and locations in Iran which we needed to visit.”

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-04/iran-can-do-more-after-record-nuclear-inspections-iaea-says

Yoram Yaakobi, head of Israel R&D for the U.S. technology company, said the aim was to bring jobs closer to where Israeli Arabs live. “Twenty five percent of computer science students at the Technion Israel Institute of Technology are Arab, but they are less than 1% of all the people employed in the [tech] industry. These are people who studied computer science but return home to their villages,” he said. He said the aim was not just to hire Arab engineers but Arab women, too.

Googling ""Obama all options on the table"" brings up many, many more.

Please tell me you're joking with that second source.  It does not state that snapback sanctions were forced on Obama by Congress.  It very clearly states that Obama opposed Congress implementing additional sanctions (that is, in addition to anything proposed in the deal as well as in addition to any currently in effect).  Republicans wants to impose more sanctions for the same reason they sent a letter to Iran, political points with an important international issue.  

The snapback provision has been conceived by the Western powers involved in the negotiations and supported by the US negotiating team.  This was not something pushed on them by Republicans who think they're more important than they are.  

The real issue is whether Russia and China will accept that, as they traditionally oppose such automatic measures.  The US (Obama) wants the sanctions to snap back without having to deal with a Security Council veto.  I believe some progress has been made on this front in recent discussions.

2553,"> Noam Chomsky once said that the greatest threat the the USA and her allies imposed by Iran having nukes, would be Iran's ability to have a deterrent to US aggression in the region.

That's completely wrong though. A deterrent means having enough nukes that you are guaranteed the ability to retaliate after a first strike. Deterrents are stabilising forces. You need a lot of nukes to have a viable deterrent. This is something the US and USSR had in the 80's and 90's. 

Unfortunately Iran is not able to afford that many nukes. Neither is North Korea. Now North Korea has China to back them up and artillery which threatens Seoul. So the US is not going to attack them.

However Iran is different. They are in transition state to having a small number of nukes which would be a lethal threat to Israel in a first strike. However those nukes are still somewhat vulnerable to an Israeli or US first strike. You probably can't destroy their nuclear program because it is too dispersed. However once they have their small ICBM stock you can destroy that on the ground if they look like they will use it. And you can shoot down the ones you miss with missile defence.

So Iranian ICBMs are not a deterrent. All it would take is Ahmadinejad to mouth off sufficiently for Israel to consider an Iranian first strike to be a possibility and I'd expect an Israeli first strike.

Basically Iran is slowly (and very ostentatiously) building a knife and taking it to a gunfight.

> Kids this is not a black and white situation- do not be provoked into labelling an enemy so easily.

I'd quite agree. Not all nuclear arsenals are the same. Big ones act as strategic stabilisers. Small ones are destabilising.

Interestingly the USSR had a dangerously small arsenal in the 50's - a dozen or so land based ICBMs and no subs. And, not surprisingly, there were people in the US who advocated a first strike to destroy it. The US being the US doesn't do things by halves and has always had a large survivable arsenal which was always a strategic stabiliser once they faced nuclear armed adversaries.",0.008345358345358343,positive,Iran Sanctions,0.5041726791726792,positive

The main thing you are missing is that oil production isn't anywhere near ""maxed out"". If oil rises in price, producers will produce more because 1) their profits will be greater, and 2) the marginal cost of producing oil in some places (mostly in the Americas and Asia) will be overcome by the increased price. 

Middle East oil is the cheapest to produce, so item 2) is irrelevant for it. The only thing Iran considers to maximize its profit is price, and the sanctions (whether we like them or not) have dropped the price Iran can sell its oil for due to a limited market. In fact, other oil producers like the price increase from a drop in effective supply. But prices don't get crazy high because more producers come online as it makes sense for them to. And Iran gets the shaft because they can't get the going rate for their exports because their selling options are limited and they are forced to sell at a discount. The sanctions really have isolated the effect on Iran; that some countries in Asia get around the embargo was fully expected and doesn't mean it hasn't had a significant impact on Iran.

The real winners are the other countries that produce oil, and those that get Iran's oil at a discount. The real loser is Iran, or any country that becomes addicted to Middle East oil as a result of the temporary discount on Iran's oil. And the rest of the world is relatively unaffected.

>Based on intelligence estimates at the commencement of hostilities, American leaders expected the tide of the war to quickly shift in Israel's favor, and that Arab armies would be completely defeated within 72 to 96 hours. On October 6, Secretary of State Kissinger convened the National Security Council's official crisis management group, the Washington Special Actions Group, which debated whether the U.S. should supply additional arms to Israel. High-ranking representatives of the Defense and State Departments opposed such a move. Kissinger was the sole dissenter; he said that if the U.S. refused aid, Israel would have little incentive to conform to American views in postwar diplomacy. Kissinger argued the sending of U.S. aid might cause Israel to moderate its territorial claims, but this thesis raised a protracted debate whether U.S. aid was likely to make it more accommodating or more intransigent toward the Arab world.

>

>.

>By October 8, Israel had encountered military difficulties on both fronts. In the Sinai, Israeli efforts to break through Egyptian lines with armor had been thwarted, and while Israel had contained and begun to turn back the Syrian advance, Syrian forces were still overlooking the Jordan River and their air defense systems were inflicting a high toll on Israeli planes. It became clear by October 9 that no quick reversal in Israel's favor would occur and that IDF losses were unexpectedly high.

>During the night of October 8–9, an alarmed Dayan told Meir that ""this is the end of the third temple."" He was warning of Israel's impending total defeat, but ""Temple"" was also the code word for nuclear weapons. Dayan again raised the nuclear topic in a cabinet meeting, warning that the country was approaching a point of ""last resort"". That night Meir authorized the assembly of thirteen 20-kiloton-of-TNT (84 TJ) tactical atomic weapons for Jericho missiles at Sdot Micha Airbase, and F-4 aircraft at Tel Nof Airbase, for use against Syrian and Egyptian targets. They would be used if absolutely necessary to prevent total defeat, but the preparation was done in an easily detectable way, likely as a signal to the United States. Kissinger learned of the nuclear alert on the morning of October 9. That day, President Nixon ordered the commencement of Operation Nickel Grass, an American airlift to replace all of Israel's material losses. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Kissinger told Sadat that the reason for the U.S. airlift was that the Israelis were close to ""going nuclear"". European countries refused to allow U.S. airplanes carrying supplies for Israel to refuel at their bases, fearing an Arab oil embargo, with the exception of Portugal and the Netherlands. Portugal permitted the United States to use a leased base in Azores, and the defence minister of the Netherlands, apparently acting without consulting his cabinet colleagues, secretly authorised the use of Dutch airfields.

>

>Israel began receiving supplies via U.S. Air Force cargo airplanes on October 14, although some equipment had arrived on planes from Israel's national airline El Al before this date. By that time, the IDF had advanced deep into Syria and was mounting a largely successful invasion of the Egyptian mainland from the Sinai, but had taken severe material losses. According to Abraham Rabinovich, ""while the American airlift of supplies did not immediately replace Israel's losses in equipment, it did allow Israel to expend what it did have more freely"".  ...

> The Syria legislation targets key backers of Assad such as Russia and Iran, according to Royce, by requiring the president to sanction countries or companies that do business with or provide financing to the Syrian government or the Central Bank of Syria.

> Secretary of State John Kerry last month called for a war crimes investigation of Russia and Syria, a move that escalated already heated rhetoric against Moscow for its part in a deadly military offensive in Aleppo, Syria&#039;s largest city, and its longstanding support of Assad. The Syria legislation, formally titled the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, is named after a crime scene photographer for the Syrian military who was reassigned to photograph the bodies of imprisoned Syrian rebels and dissidents after the conflict began.

Don't get me wrong - I think the negotiations are a waste of time even with sanctions. In fact I'd call them off and keep the current EU/US sanctions. The odds are that Iran will nuclearise anyhow. Still they will only have a few dozen rather primitive ICBMs in the near future. These could be shot down with missile defence and in any case the regime could be deterred.

In the long run I think the only solution is to promote regime change within Iran. Invading is out of the question but the student movement seems to be slowly eating away at the regime all on its own. I'd provide vocal support for this and donate money whilst treating the current regime as illegitimate. I.e. follow the game plan with Eastern European communist regimes. Any action taken should be agreed with Iranian opposition people though.

Once the regime goes I'd negotiate with great fanfare - E.g. the Secretary of State flying to Iran and then the new Iranian President visiting Washington to meet with the POTUS. At this point I'd offer and end to sanctions in return for getting rid of the nukes. Also the US could unblock Iran's access to international trade and offer to buy up weapons grade material at above market prices.

The best case would be that a democratic Iran would disarm voluntarily like South Africa did.
