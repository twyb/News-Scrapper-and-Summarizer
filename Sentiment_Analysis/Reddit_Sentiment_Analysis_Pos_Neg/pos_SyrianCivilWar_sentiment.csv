I think there may be some middle finger involved.

Sure, Pakistan doesn’t want to get caught up in Saudi-Iranian rivalry in Syria. Pakistan has plenty of Shia in their own country. Taking sides might bring the conflict home.

But if that was the reason, there was no need for a public announcement. It doesn’t benefit anyone other than Assad, and Pakistan has no interest in doing him any favors. They could have just sat tight and not said anything. And if Saudi Arabia asked them to contribute soldiers to the war, they could have made their excuses in private. No need to publicly defy them.

I think the reason for the public statement is that Pakistan is unhappy with the 34-nation “coalition” Saudi Arabia announced earlier. They included Pakistan in the coalition without even consulting with Pakistan, without bothering to ask Pakistan if they were willing to join.

Pakistan is pissed that Saudi Arabia is taking them for granted, and this is their payback to tell them: “hey, you don’t own us, we have our own policies which may differ from your interests.”

He only vaguely looks like Baghdadi because of his goatee mirroring Baghdadi's 2003 prison mugshot - this guy is some 20 years younger too. The group pictured with McCain actually got assaulted and massacred by ISIS in November 2013 for the meeting, they called the group ""McCain's dogs"".

Do you know why we don't do that though? Partly because were not genocidal maniacs, and also because were not interested in building an empire. Our economy is not based on constant land expansion. We don't care if Muhammad takes back his patch of dirt after we leave, because we never wanted his patch of dirt in the first place. 

We are in the business of building allies. Not an empire. Do you know why? Because Empires over extend themselves. They collapse under their own weight. The US could easily go the empire rout, and be successful for a very long time like Rome was. But we know what inevitably happens to empires. We never over extend ourselves, we have stayed the same size for decades now despite fighting a multitude of wars. No one but us would classify that as good, but it actually is. It means we never fight on our own turf, and we never lose turf or really anything for that matter. Sometimes these efforts are successful (West Germany, South Korea, Japan, etc...), and sometimes they are not (South Vietnam, Iraq, etc...), but the times that are successful outweigh the failures. America has only gotten stronger over the years. Not weaker. We just fought two simultaneous conflicts and during them neither you nor I had to get ration cards for sugar or milk. We could still buy silk, steel, and anything else we wanted. THATS NUTS. Seriously. I don't think you realize how much horse power that shows the US economy has.

If some idiot tries to attack the US, they have to keep in mind the fact that for everyone of us they kill, they are likely going to lose 100+ in response.

During the siege the mongols launched plague victims over the walls to infect the city. This led to the spread of the Black Death. It killed 75-200 million people.

This is absurd. Hindus killed millions and instituted one of the most humane systems of social organization in human history, the caste system. At least the Quran for all it's faults teaches that all humans are born equal. 

Atheist rulers like Stalin and Mao killed many tens of millions each and enforced Atheism on hundreds of millions. I am an atheist myself, but I am not going to sugarcoat it just to make my belief system look better. 

Christianity was spread by the sword to billions of people. It was spread through first the Roman emperor adopting it and spreading his religion through violence. Then it was enforced on the pagans throughout Europe. Then it was spread to the Americas through the killing of millions. Cortez alone killed millions in his blood drenched conquest of Mexico, spreading Christianity and sacrificing natives the whole way through. It was spread to Africa through colonialism and subjugation of natives. In Europe they killed tens of millions more for believing the wrong form of Christianity in the Thirty Years War.

Haha, the inquisition was not even close to being the worst. It's child's play compared to other Christian atrocities. It's just notorious because it targeted Jews who were disguising themselves as Christians. The imagery of people being tortured for what they were suspected of doing in private stuck with people for some reason. Like the witch hunts in America.

But saying that Jesus and Muhammad taught virtually the same thing is quite shocking. Jesus never killed anyone nor did he instruct others to do so. Jesus never held slaves or instructed others to do so. Jesus never raped nor did he instruct others on how to. Jesus was non-violent and taught people to love their fellow man. He was known as the ""Prince of Peace"" - Jesus is recorded as kicking out corrupt money lenders out of a place of worship. None of them were hurt. The only recorded person hurt around Jesus was a Roman soldier who was cut by his follower Peter during the arrest of Jesus. Jesus healed the soldier and :

1125,"1) this point kind of relies on the idea that the only way we can relate to something is if people who were alive to experience it are still around. 

But why is that the case? If it were, then the study of any history beyond the last living generation would be pointless, because there would be no one alive who could tell you, in person, what living through the black death was like, or how life was in ancient Egypt for example.

Fortunately, people don't think like that, and have come to the understanding that there are other sources aside from living human beings that are reliable sources of history and can help us understand what living in that time period was like. Long after the last veteran of world war 2 dies, the diary of Anne Frank will serve as a testament to how difficult it was to be a jew in nazi germany. 

Living people are not our only ties to history. They aren't the only thing that keeps it ""relatable"". Therefore your measurement between those two wars is invalid.

2) I did a minor in psychology. I took a whole course on memory (as well as neuroscience, neurochemistry, lots of brain stuff). You tried to say that remembering and knowing are two different things. Well, what you actually wanted to say was remembering from personal experience and remembering from someone else narrating their personal experience are two different things, because I can tell you with my background that you cannot learn anything without memory. The very act of learning requires you to commit something new to memory. That's not my opinion, that's fact. If its of any value, I had to create an entirely new wiki page as part of a memory project on the management of traumatic memories, so I did quite a bit of study on how psychotherapy involving ""relearning"" techniques can help modulate painful memories. 

But actually anyone with basic knowledge could make the same argument I did. Learning and remembering are the same thing. The only way you sort of get around that is by changing the definition of remembering, which you later did, to say, ""remembering the experience of the event"" as opposed to ""remembering the facts of the event"", but notice, they both involve ""remembering"".

1127,"1. Relative relatability? As in how one relates to how one relates to something? Did you really write that? 

I'm not explicitly saying that reading about an event provides one with greater understanding than reading about it does. I'm saying:

Living through something is not the only useful means by which a person can hope to relate to it. 

Also, since we're discussing wars, events that took place over many years, and on a very much larger scale than an individual, say, as compared to an event like the Hindenburg crashing, the scope of understanding a person who has lived through said wars is not as useful. No one person witnessed all of World War 2. A great deal more information is contained in many books about World War 2 than any person who ever lived through it. So again, giving such weight to personal experience as to discount every other method of knowing as being less relatable, and therefore less relevant or useful, is dumb.

And then, probably the weakest part of your point here is ""almost nobody living experienced either one"". Well, we know that nobody living experienced the Civil War. So using your argument, it is not relatable at all. But to have lived through World War 2 with some memory of it, you just have to be 80. Surprise! There are still 80 year Olds in the world. Now your argument is, there's so few of them compared to the population today that it is irrelevant and that's where I say, now you're mixing up what you should be comparing. You should be comparing the living people who remembered each war, civil and ww2. If one is zero, and the other is not, then using your measurement of relatability (even though it's silly), then ww2 is obviously more relatable than the civil war.

2. Your example of someone in person saying ""I remember World War 2,"" is not the same context of someone asking ""Who remembers a war 70 years ago?"", which is what you *said*. What you said can be read as ""Who remembers *of* a war 70 years ago?"", in which case, anyone who has ever heard about World War 2 can say ""I do."" It can too, be read as, ""who remembers a war 70 years ago personally,"" but your sentence doesn't specify this. 

Again, it's not what you tried to say, it's what you said. You spent the next 5 posts trying to tell me that there were two different kinds of remembering, when you made no distinction with that sentence initially.

3. That's your objection? Because it looks like your objection has been that people don't relate to those numbers on a personal level. 

The argument that you're stating now suggests the possibility that a person may be misled by isolated numerical data and draw the wrong conclusions because their knowledge of the subject for which statistics are being presented is limited. And that's true, that is totally possible. 

But not knowing the historical context in which those conflicts occurred can be fixed. A person can read about any of those conflicts and decide that comparing body counts between conflict a and conflict b is foolish, because of some fundamental difference in the way wars were fought, for example.

But again, that's something that is going to be more clearly understood by reading than experiencing it, which would give you the kind of information necessary to decide that the American Civil War is a better comparison to present day Syria than world war 2 is. You could have said that from the start, it would have been much more sensible rather than making a vague statement about remembering world war 2.

1129,"""There is relatively much more relatability to the present time as there is to the civil war because we are living it,"" I think is going to stand out in my head as one of the most nonsensical sentences I've read in a long while. 

I think what you need to realize is that just because you can personally relate to a time period does not necessarily mean that you have a better understanding of it when it comes to context of comparing it with another time period. Sometimes without the benefit of hindsight you don't grasp the bigger picture of the whole event. And like I said, living through world war 2 will not make you an expert on world war 2, nor will it necessarily give you an a level of understanding of suffering, that for others who came later, is simply incomprehensible. The idea that that is the case is ridiculous. World War 2 is simply too large an event to say that the way to relate best to casualty statistics is to have lived through their reporting. The same goes for the Civil War. Do you think that bomber gunner I interviewed really knows about the shift in political climate in Germany post-WW1 which led to conditions being ripe for Hitlers rise to power? The majority of deaths he saw were during aerial sorties, either due to enemy aircraft or flak. How does that experience make him better able to relate with a Syrian civilian who lost half their family in a sectarian massacre? 

I would argue that the relatability of those statistics has nothing to do with whether or not you lived through the time period in which they occurred, but rather, if you understand the time period in which they occurred, and generally speaking hindsight is 20-20. That's what history is. Later analysis of events that provide deeper insight. 

How do you measure ""significantly"", when you say that WWII is not more significantly relatable to the current generation than the Civil War?

What are your arguments to counter the notion that WWII has echoed much more strongly in the present day than the Civil War has, given that it ushered in the Atomic Age which affects current ideas of energy consumption, and things like potential global conflict between nuclear powers, say, regarding Ukraine right now, or intermittently India and Pakistan. Or what about the fact that the Holocaust is called *the* Holocaust because even though holocausts have occurred before and after the program instituted in the third Reich, that no other campaign of genocide has left such as impressionable mark on this generations mindset. It continues to be brought up in discussions about the Levantine conflict, both as a defense of the nation of Israel, and as an accusation against them regarding their treatment of Palestinians. Or what about cultural carryovers from WWII? From Hollywood you have things like pearl harbour, saving private Ryan, enemy at the gates, band of brothers etc. What about the slogan ""keep calm and carry on"" which has been adapted from British ww2 war propaganda to become a popular meme? What about the advancement of computer science by Alan Turing and what it means for our attempts at artificial intelligence today? What about German developments in the field of rocketry and what they've meant for our space programs? What about the rise of neo-nazi groups in eastern Europe and the resurgence of far right political parties in various European nations? These are all things which we have in present day which have some very strong relations to world war 2. In fact, specifically with regards to Ukraine, one popular position is to not act with appeasement towards Vladimir Putin as Neville Chamberlain did with Hitler in response to German aggression in Czechslovakia and Poland. So tell me, with the fact that current events are almost daily compared to situations that occurred in world war 2, how is it that you think world war 2 isn't relatable to this generation? Hitler is this generations napoleon. The final solution is this generations holocaust. World war 2 is our ""war to end all wars"" and it's something everyone learns about in school.

>Many countries sympathise with the Assad's government narrative that the opposition are Arab-backed Sunni fundamentalists and terrorists.
>Just as some critics argue that the massacres in Libya last year and Racak, Kosovo, in 1999 are exaggerated or fabricated, similar scepticism about Houla will persist, even in the face of incontrovertible evidence - and that will affect how the UN Security Council lines up on the issue.

Like with Egypt, the driving force behind this belief is the far-right and their fear that a power vacuum will lead to a Muslim Brotherhood type arrangement or Marxist state. The kicker is they've managed to frame it in such a way to get gullible liberal teenagers to think that by supporting a hard-line military dictator against a rising up by ordinary workers and youth that they're in some way sticking it to the war mongering western man. The best way to do this is with the old 'conspiracy' stuff, telling people it's all a big con by the media. People love thinking they have 'insider knowledge' so they lap stuff like this up. Just look at nutbag Alex Jones' take on it all.

* These attacks have escalated omnipresent fears of a return to civil war, as the bombings follow a recent spike in violence.
* It is believed that groups linked to Al-Qaeda are behind the latest attack, although no group has yet claimed responsibility.
* The UN envoy to Iraq, Martin Kobler, warned earlier this month that that the battlefields in Iraq and Syria were merging.
* To counter these losses Al-Qaeda groups have attempted to ignite a wider regional sectarian war.
* Otherwise, instead of a civil war, we could be looking at a regional war, which would cause death and destruction beyond the unfathomable amount the Middle East has already seen.

I think it depends on contexts, its a term they can use to pick on any act - whether it's American abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan, French troops in the Central African Republic or British actions in Afghanistan etc.. and press the term 'west' and 'western' into service.  In this case I think its aimed at the US simply because the US would likely be the driver behind any intervention (given that neither the EU as a bloc, the UK, Germany or France as nations, NATO as an alliance etc.. really have the kind of direct interests in Syria that the US does in a regional sense, although I might be wrong..).

You are right, they are trying to protect their interests and don't want the US to push for action that would harm them.  Regime change in Syria will complicate matters for Russia and they aren't keen on that, whether it comes from Syria or from the outside.

I don't think that really makes sense for Russia as they probably (one hopes) would prefer a stable (if nothing else...) Syria.  It's not that different from US support for questionable regimes in that human rights records, military atrocities and general nastiness come second when you are looking for strategic military bases or regional influence, albeit holding out during a civil war is a rather novel idea...  It does make sense for the US if, as some reports suggest, you have international jihadists going to Syria to shoot at Syrian Army targets rather than taking the trip to Afghanistan to shoot at Americans and NATO forces.

> setting a trap to kill vermin seems much more efficient.

The problem there of course is the assumption that there is a limited supply of militants.. Syria has at fairly major component of people who actually want to see some type of freedom, maybe not along traditional 'western' lines, but certainly on their own terms, they aren't the same type of international militant as you might have seen in Iraq or see in Afghanistan, they have a grievance and clearly a will to fight (not unlike some of the Afghan fighters in Afghanistan..). Instability breeds instability, the situation in Syria as it stands, or as an ongoing conflict is not good for anyone, not the US, not Russia and least of all for Syrians.

The real issue has very little to do with the US, other then the schizophrenic way that the US dealt with the Syria and the red-line situation. The major players at this point are the Iranians (who are desperately trying to hold together the Shia governments in Iraq and Syria). The Shia government (which has marginalized the Sunni population since 2010 in a big non-trivial way), and ISIS. ISIS is not Al Qaeda. They tried the affiliate thing for a bit, but their brutality was too much for Al Qaeda, and they got punted. There might be a veteran of the second Afghani war with these guys, and maybe a few guys who survived the Awakening in Iraq... but the core of these guys are Syrian survivors. 

This is really a new event. US involvement, for all intents and purposes, ended with the success of the Surge. Obama half-heartily negotiated for a status of forces agreement that would keep some troops, and more importantly US mediation between the Shia and the Awakening Councils (the Sunnis). When that presence went away, a coalition between Al Malaki and Iranian groups basically marginalized the secular/sunni groups (led by Alawi). 

All of this has led to a large disenfranchised Army (which is still more Sunni then Shia) who made the exact same calculation in 2014 that they made in 2007 - it's better to see the Shia fail, and have war, then be under their subjugation. The problem is that in 2007, Iran wasn't that big of a factor, Syria wasn't on fire, and the US was paying attention. None of those things are true now. 

When ISIS came on the scene, and ratcheted up the violence, I remember thinking that these guys were going to make Al Qaeda look like choir boys before they finally achieved their martyr-hood. They learned from Al Qaeda's defeat, are well organized, have a border to retreat across safely, probably have chemical weapons and now have a shit-ton of money. There are also allegations of protection from Russia, but I think the phrase dis-interested protection probably applies better. 

As far as Baghdad goes, if ISIS isn't stopped by US airstrikes (which is the direction the administration appears to be going - wanna bet they don't go to congress for authorization?), then they will slam into the Sadr-brigades, which will full-on re-ignite a civil war. Same death squads, same tribal violence, nastier weapons. Baghdad has a Shia population, but it also has a Sunni population. 

Only this time, no Petreus, no Bush pulling a about face and the surge, no international action. 

ISIS won't just stick with what they have. They have a goal - a new celiphate - and they have a enemy - the Shia. If they don't take Baghdad, they risk the Iranians coming in big time with the Al Quds force. They also know that insurgencies are most at risk when they have to move large numbers of people on roads. 

It's going to get worse before it gets better.

Kurdish peshmergas (who have not received their salary for 4 months because Baghdad cut them off) are the only ones protecting their region & gave Baghdad warning of what was going on but they just ignored them. The Kurds are the only ones helping over 100k displaced Arabs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8vghaQjAn4&feature=youtu.be).

A tale of high level corruption in both parties. http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/06/joining-dots-carlyle-group-booz-allen.html

Background:

Booz Allen Hamilton is owned by the Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group are a private equity fund that invests in lots of companies that make money out of the business of war - arms companies, private spy contractors etc.

Significant board members, associates and ""consultants"" of the Carlyle Group include the Bush's and a who's who of ex US government war hawks for the last 40 years.

Significant investors in the Carlyle group include the House of Saud and the Bin Laden Family.

Saudi Arabia wants a very high oil price - it sells lots of oil.

Saudi Arabia's foreign policy is directed at increasing the price of oil. Mostly this is done by destabilizing and starting conflicts and wars in, other countries that have oil (or are major distribution routes).

This is done in two main ways:-

By funding, arming and recruiting Islamic Extremist terrorists to attack other countries

By bribing the American government to conduct policy that is in the interests of Saudi Arabia and not in the interests of America.

Having a high oil price is directly against the interests of America and it's main export market - Europe. Every $1 rise in the price of a barrel of oil makes everyone in America, Europe and over 99% of the rest of the world poorer (except for the major owners & CEO's of oil companies and oil assets).

Some of the evidence for the involvement of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States in funding, arming, recruiting and supporting Islamic terrorism:-

If the NSA is actually fighting terrorism why haven't they stopped Saudi Arabia, Qatar & Kuwait funding Islamic terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Nusra? http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/06/if-nsa-is-actually-fighting-terrorism.html

Saudi Royal Family and Saudi government involvement in 9/11 http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/06/saudi-royal-family-and-saudi-government.html
 

It is also in the interests of the Carlyle Group, in order to boost their profits, that there is more war, conflict and Islamic terrorism:-

Booz Allen Hamilton and the Carlyle Group: A tale of high level corruption in both parties

The Details of Booz Allen Hamilton, Carlyle and some of the significant players

Lost in the Edward Snowden debate is a critical look at his former employer, the company doing the spying on Americans in the first place: Booz Allen Hamilton.

Booz Allen Hamilton is a government contractor, with 99% of its revenue coming from the US government. Not only does it receive money from the NSA, but also the US Army, US Navy, US Air Force, US Marine Corps, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and ... the IRS. In addition, Booz Allen is heavily connected to the CIA.

Among the individuals involved in running the company, we have:

James Clapper - current Director of National Intelligence (DNI), head of NSA, the man who lied to Congress about the fact that NSA is actively spying on Americans, is a former executive

Mike McConnell - a current executive of the company, had Clapper's job (DNI) during George W. Bush's administration (keep it in the family, eh?) -- he worked for Booz Allen before Bush, then worked for Bush, then back to Booz Allen after Bush

James Woolsey - former CIA Director, current executive (see Jan Helfeld's interview of Mr. Woolsey where it becomes clear that Woolsey has no interest in discussing principles, only war)

Melissa Hathaway - former executive, also worked for McConnell during the Bush administration

Ian Brzezinski - former executive, son of Zbigniew Brzezinski, co-founder of the Trilateral Commission with David Rockefeller, central figure in the NWO crowd, and mastermind of Operation Cyclone

Dov Zakheim - this character is ... unbelievable:

1993 - His company, System Planning Corporation, had a subsidiary called Tridata Corporation, which was the company that ""oversaw"" the investigation of the 1993 WTC bombing

2000 - Part of the neocon Project for a New American Century, he is co-author of ""Rebuilding America's Defenses,"" in which he is credited with the infamous line, ""... some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.""

2001 - He is appointed Comptroller of the Pentagon, in which $2.3 trillion promptly goes ""missing""

2001 - Attack on 9/11 occurs; some people are suspicious of his connections, since his company, SPC, in involved in flight systems capable of remote controlling aircraft, and because he was the guy who leased 32 Boeing 767 aircraft to McDill Air Force Base (2 of the 9/11 aircraft were 767's), and McDill is close to Elgin AFB, which was the location that was to be used if Operation Northwoods had gone live

2004 - Goes to work for Booz Allen Hamilton.

2012 - Advisor on Middle East policy for Mitt Romney campaign (gee ... ya think Romney would have gone to war in the Middle East???)

Booz Allen Hamilton is owned by the Carlyle Group.

One of the big investors in the Carlyle Group was the Bin Laden family in Saudi Arabia. Yeah ... THAT Bin Laden family. And instrumental in being the ""go between"" for Carlyle/Bin Laden was a guy by the name of George H. W. Bush. Maybe you've heard of him? The House of Saud are also big investors in the Carlyle Group.

The CEO of the Carlyle Group (remember, they OWN Booz Allen Hamilton) is Frank Carlucci. Mr. Carlucci has quite a resume:

Nixon Administration - Director of the Office for Economic Opportunity (the ""War on Poverty"" -- and a great place to decide who gets government contracts)

Carter Administration - Deputy Director of the CIA

Reagan Administration - National Security Advisor and Secretary of Defense (Donald Rumsfeld is Carlucci's protege)

He is or has been with the Project for a New American Century and a member of the Board of Trustees for the RAND Corporation, a CIA front that develops policies that the Military Industrial Complex then carries out.

You want a NWO guy? Carlucci is your man. And CEO of Carlyle Group, owner of Booz Allen Hamilton, spying on YOU.

At RAND, his specialty was Middle East policy. What do you know? That was also the specialty of Graham Fuller, CIA guy who was the father-in-law of Ruslan Tsarni, uncle of Tamarlan Tsarnev, suspected Boston bomber.

Speaking of the Boston bombing and Tamarlan Tsarnaev, he had a couple of trips to Russia that made the news. But what did not make the news (in America, but it did in Russia) is that he went there for ""training"" that was funded by the Jamestown Foundation. And what do you know? The Jamestown Foundation (CIA front) has among its past board members none other than Dick Cheney and Marcia Carlucci, wife of Frank Carlucci.

Given all their connections and government contracts, here's an interesting question: Booz Allen Hamilton has not only been involved in spying via the NSA, but they have also received no-bid contracts from the IRS. What do they know about the American people via the IRS?
Now, one of the things you will start to see if you look around at some of the big corporations these days is that many of them are involved in what they call ""corporate citizenship"" or something similar. What this means at the surface level is they are being ""good citizens"" by donating to charity. But when you go beyond the surface, you will see something else going on.
Booz Allen Hamilton donates money to the Clinton Global Initiative. The CGI is a part of the Clinton Foundation (yeah, THAT Clinton).

The Clinton Foundation has been implicated in bribery on an international level. Clinton gave himself a special little privilege while president wherein he exempted the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation from the normal rules of disclosure regarding publicly listing who its contributors were. It's a secret foundation. And it has over $200 million in assets now. And is alleged to be used as a way to funnel black money from corrupt governments around the world for behind-the-scenes deals like special oil contracts, arms dealing, US government foreign aid deals, whatever.

So folks, what you are not being told in the media about Edward Snowden's former company is that it is not only spying on you, but it is probably checking out your tax returns, too, and also receiving some of your tax money in government contracts, which it then funnels to CIA-connected/Military Industrial Complex-connected/NWO-connected individuals and organizations.

Something like this: Your tax money (taken from you by force) -> IRS -> Booz Allen Hamilton -> Clinton Foundation -> foreign bribes -> more contracts for the Military Industrial Complex -> more spending by foreign governments -> more foreign aid from the US government -> more US government spending -> more taxes needed -> more taxes from YOU.
Oh ... and they are spying on you, too.
But Edward Snowden ... yeah HE is the bad guy here. Uh huh ... move along ... nothing to see here.

I mean, Saddam was a Sunni, right? I presume much of his army (which was disbanded by the Bush Administration) were Sunni as well.

Does it not seem possible that after they disbanded, Saddams' former commanders put feelers out round the Sunni world looking for a way to reconstitute their army and found financial backers amongst fellow Sunnis in Saudi Arabia/UAE?

The reason I specifically single out the Saudis/UAE is that the US media has been deafening in its silence in reporting on what the ISIS command structure is, and to me these stories about them being Al Qaeda and being funded by appropriated bank funds seized like a week ago ring completely false. US media has been carrying water for the Saudis for a LONG time now so if they are involved, it makes a certain kind of sense the media would do its best to cover it up.

In any case, this army seems to be having way to much success for some rag-tag group of disaffected youths receiving terrorism training in some desert camp.

Societies in a demographic and cultural sense cant change overnight. People tend to forget that places like Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Libya, and Anatolia were all (Eastern) Roman provinces for several centuries right up until the rise of the Caliphate. On the other hand, Persia which was conquered out right was a land of Zoroastrians 'fire worshippers' as it were. While the Qu'ran was being 'revealed', the Persians and Romans were embroiled in [war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_602%E2%80%93628). The Byzantines at this time were getting absolutely dominated, and the Persians had pushed deep into core territories. Meanwhile, in Arabia, the first Muslims (when they numbered in the hundreds if not less) were at conflict with the Pagans of Mecca. In this case, the Pagans were on the side of the Persians to oppose the Muslims who were supporting the monotheistic, orthodox Christians. When defeat seemed imminent, the Pagans were jeering at Muhammad and co. to the extent that: 
>""Look the fire worshipers of Iran are winning victories and the Christian believers in Revelation and Prophethood are being routed everywhere. Likewise, we, the idol worshipers of Arabia, will exterminate you and your religion.""

Thats when surah Rum(Rome) was revealed and made a bold prediction, that the Byzantines would be successful after they are defeated. Incidentally, the Byzantines would go on to pull one of the biggest upsets of that era. But by the end of this, they and the Persians both were exhausted, and the stars just happened to align for the Arabs that were about to emerge. 

The reason I elaborated on the circumstance is because the context is very important. These were two of the world greatest historical empires/regions. They had had states and civilization for a long time. The Arabs are a people who up to this time, had never formed a single state. But with a combination of the exhausted giants, legendary military leadership, and an extremely powerful intrinsic drive to expand, they managed to build the largest empire the world had ever seen. But theres a problem. Now a quarter of humanity lives in the lands youve just conquered. These lands have civil institutions, they have customs, cultures, languages etc. No way you can hold that down if you come in with an extremely aggressive 'my way or the highway' policy. So ultimately, my point isn't wether the Caliphate was accepting and tolerant of native ways of life and customs, what im saying is,  *it had to be*. Why else would the people be ok with it? Due to the tax systems, the state stood to make money either way. As long as the taxes were paid, you are free to live as you were. And I could/can argue that the former Byzantines and Persians preferred the 'new guard' to the old, cus if they didn't, they wouldn't have been complicit with it and so accepting of the new leadership. This is why places like Persia and Egypt didn't become the 90% Muslims as they are today until 7/8 centuries after conquest. If you want an actual historians take, refer to these passages from Hugh, Kennedy's ""The Great Arab Conquests"" 

Chapter 3
>[Speaking on the conquest of Iraq] In field battles at Qādisiya and Jalūlā, and cities like Ctesiphon at Tustar, the Sasanian forces were decisively defeated. With the collapse of the Persian army, the Arabs were prepared to make fairly easy terms with the rest of the population - they did not massacre townspeople and villagers, they did not seize their houses or their lands, they did not interfere with their religions and customs, they did not even settle among them. They demanded only that taxes be paid and that the people did not aid their enemies. Whether the taxes were higher or lower than they had been under the previous administration we cannot tell, but we can be certain that most people in Iraq thought that it was a bargain well worth making.""

Chapter 12
> ""In many ways acceptance of Muslim rule was the result of Muslim policy towards the enemy: it was almost always preferable to surrender to the invaders and to make terms and pay the taxes than to resist to the last. The Islamization and Arabization that followed conquest over the next two or three centuries would not have occurred if political conquest had not already succeeded, but they were not a direct and inevitable consequence of that conquest. Instead, it was a gradual, almost entirely peaceful result of the fact that more and more people wanted to identify with and participate in the dominant culture of their time.""

One final thing I would like to add, that really sets the original 3 Caliphates apart from a group like ISIS, is an example and directive set in the Hadith or life stories of the Prophet Muhammad. His Companions, the Shahabah were very adamant in their ways and wanted to spread Islam in an aggressive, ""written in stone"" manner. The Prophet explicitly tells them not to spread the religion in such a way that drives the people away from it. Everything must be handled in context, with understanding, and with mercy above all other principles, because their God is a merciful one.  Obviously, what with 500,000 people fleeing Mosul, ISIS doesn't seem to get the message that their way of doing things isn't something that is acceptable either in the religion or in society. I know this was kind of lengthy, it has to be to properly get the ideas across, but I hope you can see the difference in thinking and action of the Caliphates and a group like ISIS, and how the latter's deeds are deviant from the example of the Prophet who's mission they claim to represent. ISIS lacks knowledge and they lack empathy, and this is fatal. Or maybe they have both and the whole ""restore the glory of the caliphate"" is a war cry and means of gathering the support of a distraught, miserable populace. Maybe their actual purpose and intentions are far more insidious. Who knows?

Sadly those who will give their blood are motivated for the right reasons but ultimately giving everything for the wrong people.

People have far too long looked forward for a cause that leads to more of the same. Human beings are the most important resource we have. The few are powerless without a loyal base of followers. For christ sake we live in a time when we can communicate across the surface of a large rock that can evoke a meaning of either love or hate. Vitriol exacerbates our difference to such a degree that it is seemingly impossible to grow out of thinking about one group needing to fight against another. Are individuals the only entity capable of logic? Are we in a state of perpetual chaos against order that will end when this our understanding of the conscious organization of the universe (us) decides to finally destroy the legacies of our ancestors, inherit challenges we have overcome, and erase all evidence of the fact that we existed? Will another civilization much like ourselves, desperate not to be alone, discover our cries for companionship only to look where the signal was sent and see us destroy ourselves from within? I'm disappointed with being a human but thrilled at the same time. We are capable of nothing short of miracles, vastly making our predecessors obsolete. With our outlook of our individualist drive fixated on the belief that we can do better and be better tomorrow than we are today, it is a wonder to me that no country exists where the meaning of the statement is practiced and championed by all. 

My wish is that I am cynical.

My optimistic view of our role in the future we will be forced to consume ourselves in is ensuring social changes happen with shorter intervals, more progressive tangible improvements, empathy and understanding for others in a way that fosters individuals independent of the idea of ""normal,"" and above all absolute sincere desire to be humble to others. I'll finish by stating that I may think I am correct, but I know in the long term I am not. Nobody will be correct forever. If ideas emanate from a familiar source (absolutely-equal for each generation's desire to improve) during each emergence of the new, then perhaps we are creatures gifted with the ability to dynamically evolve our conscious interpretation of reality due a bizarre yet truly unique birth that is relatively premature compared to all other animals. Instead of waiting for change on a molecular level we are exposed to learning about change from the moment our brains are developing. 

We are the thinking collection of infinitesimally miniature ejaculate of whatever our universe was before its existence (assuming there was a beginning at all) to such a degree that we have somehow orchestrated subconsciously and consciously the forced obligation to progress. Young men old enough to be called boys in Iraq deserve the society they help create. To the sadness of progress women will probably still be subject to oppression. These boys could become the men who give birth to the generation that desire a best friend and partner and not a tool to continue a social order reliant on a religion of Abrahamic origins.

The results of the US backed funding of Islamic Extremist terrorist groups and the US invasion of Iraq

Iraq has been a bloodbath for a decade, it's economy and infrastructure have been ruined. Over 500,000 Iraqi's have died during the US occupation, millions have been displaced. Numerous major birth defects and other illnesses are being reported due to the US using depleted uranium in Fallujah. The US also used white phosphorus, which is banned as a chemical weapon under the Geneva convention. N.B. Iraq was never ""pacified"" by a troop surge as the Neocons claim. The Sunni's were bribed with billions of US tax dollars to keep quiet for a while - but this bribe money has now dried up.

The CIA engineered civil war in Libya, in support of Islamic Extremists from Benghazi, has turned Libya into a bloodbath with various armed militias shooting each other. It's economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins.

The CIA engineered Syrian civil war has turned Syria into a bloodbath with 140,000 (on both sides) killed. Syria's economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins. Millions have been displaced and have fled as refugees. The Islamic Extremists (which comprise almost all of the actively fighting ""rebels"") have been losing the war against Assad in Syria so they have now turned their attention back to Iraq with some major gains by ISIS including taking over $400m from Iraqi banks (we await further developments).

The US war against Pakistan has killed hundreds of innocent civilians with drone strikes including 170 children.

The civil war in Yemen where the US has used cruise missiles, cluster bombs and drone strikes in support of a corrupt dictator has turned Yemen into a bloodbath.

Boku Haram which is covertly funded and armed by the US proxy Saudi Arabia, via islamic extremists in Libya is murdering christians in Nigeria.

Mali's legitimate government was overthrown in a joint US & French military coup in 2012 to be replaced by a puppet President trained by the US at military bases in the US.

The Afghan poppy crop which had been reduced by 90% with the Taleban's ban in 2000 is now greater than ever. More Afghans are now subject to drugs warlords (of which Karzai & his brother are both major ones). Afghanistan remains a bloodbath and a hot civil war.

A semi stable government in Somalia was overthrown by Ethiopia in a US backed coup. Somalia is in chaos, with elements of this chaos murdering innocent civilians in Kenya.

More than 200 million more people now support Islamic Extremism than they did in 2005.

Ukraine has been turned into a civil war zone by a US engineered illegal Coup D'Etat in Kiev. Ukraine is joining Iraq, Syria and Libya in the utter misery, violence, death and poverty that comes with US ""liberation"".

It seems that you, and many others, believe that the general American populace exerts a great deal of control over its government. In reality, that is less and less true every day. The US government is controlled largely by entities over which the average American has no influence over, and which are a detriment to our society as well as others around the world.

You're absolutely correct that the US government, military, and business interests do not learn from the past. We have 'intervened' and caused catastrophic failure to so many functioning, peaceful representative governments that it's difficult to believe we still pursue that course of action. We've sanctioned mass killings, brutal regimes, and we're currently working very hard to strip freedoms at every level, at home and abroad. But again, you misunderstand the way American government works and is controlled. You must understand that the very rhetoric we're hated for - freedom above all, etc - has long since lost its credibility, if it ever was there. 

Many people have found great freedom in our country, but there is no way that number is higher than those we've negatively impacted around the world in Chile, Argentina, Iraq, Iran, and the myriad others over the past 7 decades.

No, Americans are not totally absolved of responsibility for the actions of our government. But the blame needs to be placed on those with undue money, and therefore undue influence, in the US government. Please keep in mind - the American 'freedom' rhetoric is a very effective communication, but it is not very accurate. more than 1 in 100 Americans are in prison, the vast majority black or hispanic, poor, and serving time for nonviolent offenses.

ISIS started as an insurgency group in Iraq when the US was still occupying the country.  They were pushed out into Syria, where, over the last few years have gained strength and support, partly because they were working with other, more moderate rebel groups, that collectively received international aid (including from the US).  

Recently ISIS has moved back into Iraq.  First they took parts of the country more sympathetic to their beliefs, but now they are moving into other parts of the country, that are less prone to supporting the group.  They initially made quick gains but were eventually slowed by the Iraqi military and Iraqi citizen groups that rallied to resist the advances by ISIS.  

In the last day or two ISIS is reported to have taken control of the biggest oil refinery in the country, a major airport, and, although it may be speculating, execute the judge responsible for sentencing Saddam Hussein to death (ISIS is made up of many people who were loyal to Hussein).

**Very confused about situation in Iraq - here are my questions that I feel US media is not addressing:**

1. Where is the money to bankroll ISIS coming from? Well-armed armies don't spring out of nowhere.

2. Armies are a totally different animal than 'terrorism' - so does this suggest either ISIS has little or no connections to Al Qaeda OR Al Qaeda is abandoning terrorism as a tactic?

3. Combining 1 and 2 - AFAIK the main source of financing for Al Qaeda comes from Saudi Arabia - so does that mean ISIS gets funding from the Saudis?

4. How much of ISIS ability to overtake cities in Iraq is based on cooperation from people in those cities?

5. If Isis is based out of Syria - how can anyone expect that Iraqi civilians are going to put up with taking orders from foreigners with no carrots to offer (as the US held out the carrot of money)? To compare Iraq and Afghanistan (which was taken over by the Taliban) seems far fetched to me because Iraq is a (relatively) far more modernized, urban society.

6. SO - possible sources of funding/support for ISIS: Saudis, UAE, Russia (who had been funding Syrian govt), US Military Contractors (not wanting US to withdraw from Iraq), Westerns who had funded Syrian rebels (they used the arms to establish new territory after not being able to topple Assad?), US govt (A group of Iraqis have been siphoning off US funding into a shadow army). I have a hard time believing Iran is in on this as ISIS is Suni and they are Shiite with ties to the current Baghdad govt. Any other ideas?

3123,">you also created the Islamic Militants in the first place with the help of your friends in Pakistani and Saudi Arabian military intelligence

Can we slow down a second? I think you may have misunderstood the situation, or perhaps you've simply never read a book about it. There are scant, if any connections between the CIA and the ""creation of Islamic Militancy"", including Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Al Qaeda is certainly funded by Saudi's, but the Government's direct connections to that funding is hard to prove. On the surface SA is much like Pakistan: it openly opposes Islamic terrorists and supposedly attempts to stop their operations in their countries.

Now, the ISI (Pakistan) most certainly created the Taliban, that much has been proven. They were created to destabilize the Soviet regime which they saw as a huge risk to their own sovereignty at a time when they felt India and the USSR were a little too chummy.

Now, back to the CIA ""creating the Islamic terrorists in the first place"". This is patently false, and most any book you read will tell you that. Joseph Collins ""Understanding the War in Afghanistan"" is a great Primer to read if you want a deeper understanding of how AQ began operating in Afghanistan. If you think all the Muja's were Wahabists, you have another thing coming. Its untrue, unsubstantiated drivel that gets repeated time and time again. Pashtun or Tajik mujahideen were not necessarily interested in the same things we associate with modern day wahabist Islam. Not even close.

The short version of it is this: The armies fighting the Soviets was a combination of Pashtuns, other ethnic groups, Al Qaeda, and what would become the Taliban (i'll just call them that for the sake of clarity). 

AQ Saudis came to Afghanistan as an attempt to gain power through noteriety in war against the soviet. They were never fully integrated into the Pashtun or Tajik resistance groups. They were seen as outsiders with a bizarre and outrageous new form of Islam that the Pashtuns really didn't like or understand. Pashtun culture is distinct from AQ which at the time was primarily Saudi rich boys playing Crusader. The Pashtuns were even distinct from the Taliban who were primarily from a particular part of Pakistan known for it's extremist madrassas. These groups worked together to expel the Soviets, but I assure you they are separate and not necessarily good friends.  Their brief alliance was to expel a larger enemy. When that enemy disappeared, the infighting between the larger Pashtun culture, the taliban, and the rest of the ethnic groups in Afghanistan came out. Al Qaeda aligned itself with the Taliban who were also Islamic extremists, but they were not one and the same at any point.

So when you say that we created Islamic Militants, you're outrageously off base. We supplied weapons to primarily the Tajik and Pashtun warlords (basically to the ""Mujahideen"" as a larger group). The ISI provided training, likely funneling some US funds into that effort, but they weren't training AQ guys, they were training ethnic Tajiks and Pashtuns. Now some weapons may have found their way into the hands of AQ or Taliban fighters but this was at a time when:

A. Those groups already existed, we didn't need to *create* them and;

B. Those groups were fighting a mutual enemy.

Also keep in mind that the CIA did not train these groups in military tactics or ""create them"", we simply gave them stinger missiles and told them how to use them against the Soviet helicopters that were starting to turn the war. All training was done by the ISI, and the training was distributed across multiple ethnic groups most of which were not interested in the Wahabist idealogies of AQ.

There are far too many people in this thread who think Al Qaeda == ISIS or that this is some sort of long running blowback. ISIS is not Al Qaeda in Iraq. That terrorist group was decimated by the Awakening and the Surge.

These guys have done something al qaeda never managed to do - form a actual militia with a standing army and government. Al Qaeda tried that, but the brutality drove the Sunni into the American Arms, and the Americans managed to keep the Shia and Sunni from killing each other long enough to neutralize the Jihadis.

They are tempered in the hell that is Syria, and they are willing to do what Al Qaeda failed at doing - deal with backlash from brutality by amping the brutality level.

I also said: *""Even some fringe FSA brigades have joined Al Nusra in fighting them, and ended up disbanding the FSA and joining either Al Nusra or the Islamic Front.""*

Of course some of the FSA are fleeing Syria, because again, as I already mentioned, they are getting their asses handed to them by the well funded and well equipped extremist groups in which they are at **war** with, combined with the fact that they are fighting Assad's SAA and Hezbollah on the second front as well.

>Moderate rebel groups **have** worked closely with the al Qaida-aligned Nusra Front and the Islamic Front, one of whose factions, Ahrar al Sham, includes al Qaida members among its founders.

The key word here is **have**. They had a shaky alliance in the beginning, because the core of the FSA are moderate and do not wish to overthrow Assad for religious reasons. The FSA is comprised of regular Syrians and defected SAA soldiers. That alliance broke last year when Al Nusra began assassinating senior FSA commanders, and then both Al Nusra and ISIS, whom were still aligned at he time, started killing just regular FSA members. The FSA then declared war against Al Nusra, as well as ISIS.

The US has been very quick to halt aid to the FSA if any of it goes to the extremists.....**Oh wait, you didn't post the link to your quote from Reuters because the content of the goddamn article says that the US and UK have been aiding the FSA, and don't want it reaching the Islamists.**

>ISTANBUL Wed Dec 11, 2013 (Reuters) - The United States and Britain suspended non-lethal aid to northern Syria after Islamist fighters seized Western-backed rebel weapons warehouses, highlighting fears that supplies could end up in the wrong hands.

And just in case you're wondering what happened in the wake of outgunned and under-trained FSA being at war with the very powerful extremist factions, as well as the very powerful SAA and Hezbollah forces fighting for Assad, some FSA members have given up fighting and fled, as they simply cannot face both the extremist groups *and* Assad's forces at the same time and expect to win. 

Some fringe FSA brigades that had a better relationship with the Islamists than the moderate core FSA (the FSA is quite disorganized due to being spread thin) even disbanded and left the FSA, and joined the extremists:

1.Are you lying or misreading? There is not mention of Scotland in the article on Operation cyclone. But I digress: All Operation Cyclone's wiki page says is what I said: that the CIA funded the Mujahideen that were ALREADY operating in Afghanistan, providing them primarily with weapons.

As I mentioned in my above comment, the crux of the argument that ""The CIA created modern radical islam"" is that A. the larger body of mujahideen fighters in afghanistan were ALL radical islamic fighters and B. that there is a direct lineage between the mujahideen and the modern day wahabist cells that operate in places like Syria, turkey, afghanistan, iraq, etc. Both of those claims are patently false.

>The CIA used the ISI and the GIP as proxies because, indeed, back then a worldwide proxy war against communism legimated alliances with jihadist groups. 

Again, you confused jihadist groups with the mujahideen. While they were islamic fighters, their actual ties were more to their various ethnic groups and even more so to their individual tribes. Only two groups of the Mujahideen can be tied directly to ""jihadist"" fighting of the recent decade: Al Qaeda, and the Taliban. Neither of these groups were directly funded or trained by the CIA. Al Qaeda themselves deny the connection between the CIA and them. The Taliban appeared in force only later, after most US involvement had ceased and their lineage is more closely tied to Pakistani Madrassas that in Northern frontier areas of Pakistan (madrassas likely funded and idealogically based on wahabist groups from Saudi Arabia

Al Qaeda is a Saudi Arabian organization funded by extremists in that country. The US never gave them money because they never needed to. They had plenty of their own money and by and large wanted nothing to do with the US. The Taliban was created explicitly by ISI, without CIA help. The CIA never liked the idea of the Taliban and wanted to install a democratic government after the Soviets left. The ISI wanted a group of radical extremists they thought they could control. Therefore, the CIA neither created nor trained the Taliban or Al Qaeda, therefore you are wrong.

>The United States most certainly created Islamic militants.

 It is well documented that Bhutto expressed concerns about the Mujahideen, but the United States was convinced that funding all ethnic groups across the board in Afghanistan would prevent any single group from becoming too strong. The Pakistani ISI had other plans, and created the Taliban. The Mujahideen as a whole were not a Frankenstein, the Taliban was. If you want to blame the creation of the modern islamic wahabist movement, blame guys like UBL who used his money to create the groups and brought fighters to Afghanistan for Jihad (even though they had no realy claims to be there...hmm sound familiar?) or blame the ISI who used Pakistani money to fund and train the Taliban so that Afghanistan would be largely under Pakistani influence. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf now admits to supporting the Taliban until 9/11...so who are you really going to blame?

Its empirically proven that unstable countries are not easier to control or corrupt, and neither are they better sources of business for American MNCs.

However, neither country is a particularly US-loving state right now, particularly Karzai led Afghanistan.

Yet after the death of the prophet and while Ali was mourning and preparing the burial ritual of Mohammed, behind the scenes him Abu bakir and all the others collaberated to take a part of Islam as they saw Ali to be way too young to handel Islam the way the want it… and it continues on where Ali's wife is murdured by Omar, but Ali is not to take revenge since he is not allowed to kill him, since the prophet has made him promise to not hurt any person. In order to keep the integrity of Islam, consequently by the time of the third khalifa Ali was already in his thirties, living in a mud house away from all the people who lived in a semi luxuries, where he took it as a heaven to live with the poor and feed them ( good characters if you ask me). Soon after, upon the rebilion in egypt against Othman (the third Khalifa), people simply saw Othman as a ruthless dictator whom wouldn't allow anyone outside of the Ummayed family into the ruling of states of Islam (egypt mainly), Ali sent both of his sons to protect and try to resolve the issue but the palace was overrun and then in the process Othman was killed. 


Aisha the prohphet's wife was one of the very supporter to overthrow Othman, matter fact she agreed to rip Othman apart. Muslims then felt astry, like no time else. Many has by then started questioning their faith, people then took up to 50 years old aged man Ali as a khalifa. Ali refused them and told them that after his brother commands to them in the Gahdear event in front of them all before he died, and you disobeyed him (Mohamed and Ali were raised in the same house matter fact Mohammed even said "" I and Ali are from the same tree, rooted in heaven…"" and numerously saying that him and Ali are the same), after a lot of convincing Ali understood fully the situation at hand. As Ali took over the ""Mukhalifien"" (the opposition) made their own armies and started threatening that they want justices for the spilled blood of Othman, awkwardly enough even Aisha said the same. Ali couldn't satisfy all of them and this opposition started cutting routes and beheading people (this is from where the ""Islamic"" killing originates), a war followed whereby Ali won by the sheer power saving Islam yet again from another downfall. 


After Ali was murdered in his prayer, his son Hassan was to be the next to inherit in the line, Muawea Ibn Abi Sufian, went on rampage saying that how can this be possible etc… Hassan gave up Khilafa but in the agreement that his brother is to be khalifa after him. Hassan's startigical thinking saved Islam as whole, as any more wars and people would have completely lost their faiths… 6-7 years later Hassan was posioned (by his own wife who was promised by Ummayed to be some sorta of princess weird huh?). When Hussain was to become the next in line Muawea instated his son Yazid as the next in line, Hussain was angered and avoided them at all costs to evade any war until Yazid sent him a messenger asking him if he will go with him in a bayea (it is just like agreeing that Yazid will be the next leader : voting ), Hussain immediately replied "" the likes of me will never go to agree to let him rule that drunken infidel"",vYazid was infuriated, though Hussian did not say anything that was untrue, this has caused many to question Yazid's power… eventually leading to a war whereby 70 men fought a thousand (ya Hussain was a bit I don't know how you say it but weird), each man with Hussain could've killed hundreds only by the will of his sword (the 70), Abbas the half brother of Hussain by himself pushed a whole army to retaliate by his sheer power till they started shooting arrows that pierced his body, it might seem fictions and I quite honestly think it is, but even opposition do not deny it. 

Anyhow mainly Shia are the one that stuck with Ali and his sons (12 to come) untill the end, the last son of Hussain has mysteriously dissapeared and reappeared several times, many question his existence. Shias claim that he is Mahdi the promised one whom is still alive and will reappear for our salvation, while Sunna disagree and say the promised on is yet to be born. Sunna's are the one that went from a Khalifa to another following their rules and guidance, Shias only admit the sons of Hussian whom are a direct line to the prophet; why, because Mohammed wed his daughter to Ali ( again I repeat they lived in the same house the father of Ali is the uncle of Mohammed whom had taken him into his house after he was orphaned)

The issue isn't so much who uses the oil, but how much it costs. 

Oil doesn't have much regional price discrimination. The price of a barrel of oil in Japan costs the same as the price of oil in US. The reason is most oil is shipped via tankers which can go where ever they can fetch the highest price. This is quite different than say natural gas which is shipped via pipelines, and so has a lot more regional price discrimination. The effect is that there is a global price for a barrel of oil, and everyone pays that amount (or something close to it).

The has a huge interest in making sure that the price of oil stays low, or at the very least climbs slowly. A quick rise in the price of oil could see a repeat of the 70s oil crisis.

But there are factors in the petroleum industry which ends up affecting the pricing of oil in regions.  Part of what makes Middle East oil valuable is that it doesn't have a lot of sulphur contaminants.  That's why they call it ""light, sweet"" crude.  And that's why Alaskan oil and Albertan tar sand oil is less ""valuable"", because it costs more to convert into usable petroleum products.  

Also, transportation costs are a factor.  Yes, a tanker can circumnavigate the globe, but no one buys its oil, if it has to charge too much for transit costs.  That is what makes the Keystone pipeline such an energy irrelevant project.  The US already gets Alberta tar sand oil; it doesn't end up in a major export port.  It ends up in refineries in the midwest, and it makes petroleum fuels cheap in the midwest.  The Keystone pipeline is about moving that tar sand oil to refineries in Louisiana and Texas, where it becomes easy to ship overseas.  Its about increasing profits by cutting transport costs and increasing competitive bidding from newly accessible markets.

Nevertheless, I do believe Iraq was invaded to be able to control who would be able to access the oil (the West or the Chinese).

I'm not sure about that. According to [this](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/06/14-iraq-military-situation-pollack#.U53JQJVVct5.reddit) excellent article, U.S. military advisors gutted the Iraqi military because it was largely non-secular and incompetent.

""*American military trainers and advisors were able to marginally improve the military effectiveness of the ISF by introducing rigorous, Western-style training programs and partnering closely with Iraqi forces in ways that allowed U.S. personnel to get to know their Iraqi counterparts. As a result of this familiarity, over the course of many months, the Americans figured out who were the good Iraqi soldiers and who were the bad, who was connected to the terrorists or militias, who was connected to organized crime, who was smart and brave, and who was lazy or cowardly. And the U.S. military then went about systematically promoting the best Iraqis, and pushing out the bad ones.*

*The greatest impact of these American efforts with the ISF in 2006-2009 were to depoliticize it, both to modestly increase its combat effectiveness and to make it professional, apolitical and therefore accepted as a stabilizing force by all Iraqis. Again, this was largely performed by promoting professional, patriotic Iraqi officers and removing the sectarian chauvinists. The U.S. also pressed Baghdad to accept more and more Sunni and Kurdish officers and enlisted personnel into the ranks. As a result, the ISF became a far more integrated force than it had been, led by a far more apolitical and nationalistic officer corps than it had been before. Indeed, in 2008, when Prime Minister Maliki sent heavily Sunni brigades from Anbar down to Basra to fight the Shia militia, Jaysh al-Mahdi, the Shia of Basra welcomed the ISF brigades and fought against the Shia militiamen.*""

He continues to say that Maliki destroyed the U.S. military's progress by removing the Sunni and Kurdish officers in an effort to secure power, unwittingly replacing them with the same incompetent Shiite officers the U.S. had worked so hard to remove. This also had the critical secondary effect of removing the ISF's secularity, turning it from a modern, secular fighting force into a Shiite militia.

Israel is a democracy in the region. It has in fact given many hundreds of thousands of Arabs & Palestinians: Israeli citizenship. Even given them representation in their country and rights to them.

The Arab states sometimes reject Palestinians unlike Israel.

The problem is that the religious extremism in the area has made it very toxic for Palestinians to ever want to try to integrate with Israelis. This has in turn caused many decades of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Israel too has done wrong in this area by use of settlers etc.

The care for Israel may not be just religious from your girlfriends parents. It may be because Israel is a western-leaning society, promoting democracy, civil rights, and modernity in the region, while the Arabs in the region do the exact opposite. I don't see why anyone would not support them.

I think during the wars with Arabs, the Israelis could have conquered more of the land and simply annexed them and given them proper representation from the start, educated them, and made them part of the Israeli state. It would have become a melting-pot country.

> Britain also directly trained Afghan forces, much of which was contracted out to 'private' security firms, a policy cleared in Whitehall; the main company was KNS - 'Keenie-Meenie Services', the name given to mercenaries fighting for Britain in the brutal war in Kenya in the 1950s. **KMS training, led by former SAS officers, was provided to small numbers of Afghan commando units at secret MI6 and CIA bases in Saudi Arabia and Oman;** the latter bases were also used as staging or refueling points for supply flights on their way to Pakistan. **In 1987, the Observer reported a secret proposal from KMS to the CIA to send small teams of ex-SAS instructors into Afghanistan to train rebels in 'demolition, sabotage, reconnaissance and para-medicine'.**

> **Ken Connor who served in the SAS for twenty-three years says that he was part of a team of 'ex-SAS' soldiers who trained selected junior commands in the mujahideen in Scotland and northern England in 1983. The Afghans were smuggled into Britain disguised as tourists, and trained in three-week cycles at secret camps. 'They were well-armed and ferocious fighters, but they lacked battlefield organisation,' Connor writes.**

> **Training involved various military activities, including the 'planning of operations, the use of explosives and the fire control of heavy weapons - mortars and artillery', 'how to attack aircraft and how to lay 
anti-aircraft ambushes aligned on the centre of a runway' and mounting 'anti-armour ambushes'. Connor notes that there was 'strong empathy' between the British trainers and the mujahideen but that there was little warmth between the mujahideen and the British government; 'it was strictly a marriage of convenience between two organisations that had nothing else in common.'**

> Various Afghan groups were supported by Britain. **One initially favoured forced was the Mahaz-i-Milli Islam (National Islamic Front of Afghanistan or NIFA).** Unusually, it was *led by a layman rather than a cleric*, Sayyad Pir Gailai, and supported the restoration of the former king, Zahir Shah - a policy in tune with Whitehall's historical preference for monarchs; Whitehall appears at first to have regarded Zahir Shah as a possible future leader once the Soviets had been defeated. The NIFA forces trained by Britain were commanded by Brigadier General Rahmatullah Safi, a former senior officer in the royal Afghan army who, after the king had been deposed, was living in exile in Britain. Safi later claimed to have trained around 8,000 men in NIFA's camps; **by the late 1990s, he was still living in London and had become the European representative of the Taliban, now in control of Afghanistan.**

> **Britain also supported the Islamist groups. One of the MI6 officers in Islamabad coordinating British assistance to the mujahideen was Alastair Crooke who, it was later reported, 'got to know some of the militants who would become leaders of al-Qaida'.** He was described by Milt Bearden, CIA station chief in Pakistan in the mid-1980s, as a 'natural on the frontier' and 'a British agent straight out of the Great Game'.

> **Training was provided to the forces of Hadji Abdul Haq, a military commander with the Younis Khalis faction of the Hezb-e-Islami. As a favour to the CIA**, MI6 ran the operation to supply Blowpipe missiles to Haq in 1986. Haq was one of those figures whom MI6 introduced to the CIA in 1981, which then had very few Aghan contacts; the CIA subsequently began a long relationship with Haq. After the latter had raised a fighting force, the CIA began shipping weapons to him and he became an intermediary between the CIA, MI6 and the Kabul front. **Haq's office in Peshawar, the organising centre of the resistance in Pakistan, was often full of MI6 and CIA operatives who supplied him with maps of new Soviet targets they wanted him to hit.**

> But Afghan resistance operations were not confined to Soviet military targets. **In Hadji Abdul Haq, Britain and the US had backed somebody prepared to use terrorism to achieve his aims. In September 1984, Haq ordered the planting of a bomb at Kabul airport that killed 28 people, many of them students preparing to fly to the Soviet Union. Eighteen months later, in March 1986, he became the first Afghan commander to be welcomed to Britain by Margeret Thatcher, and subsequently held several meetings with US President Reagan. Responding to British criticism of his role in the airport blast, Haq said that the purpose of the bomb was 'to warn people not to send their children to the Soviet Union'. A Downing Street spokesman said at the time that 'the prime minister has a degree of sympathy with the Afghan cause inasmuch as they're trying to rid their country of invaders.'**

> Another of the military commanders in Younis Khalis' faction of the Hezb-e-Islami was Jalaluddin Haqqani, who received a large quantity of US weapons, much of which were used to help equip the Arab volunteers. **A later US Defence Intelligence Agency report noted that Haqqani was 'the tribal leader most exploited by the ISI during the Soviet-Afghan war to facilitate the introduction of Arab extremists.'**

> **Milt Bearden later wrote that Haqqani was 'America's best friend during the anti-Soviet war.'The CIA and the ISI came to rely on him for testing and experimenting with new weapons systems and tactics. Haqqani would go on to become a leading military commander in the Taliban and the 'Haqqani network' is presently one of the major Taliban factions fighting the British in Afghanistan. Another of Khalis's junior commanders in the 1980s was Mohammed Omar, who would go on to lead the Taliban as Mullah Omar.**

(LOL!!)

(... Section about Massoud skipped ...)

> Britain also extended backing to the extremist Hekmatyar, who was invited to Downing Street in 1986 and met Foreign Office officials in London in 1988. **Most US aid went to Hekmatyar - by conservative estimates, at least $600 million. Hekmatyar was also a ruthless killer, famed for skinning infidels alive, while his group was responsible for some of the most horrific atrocities of the war, such as the slaughter of members of other Afghan groups that were seen as rivals. Hekmatyar worked closely with Bin Laden and took a virulently anti-Western line: Saddam Hussein's Iraq and Qadafi's Libya were also funders. A US Congress task force described his group in 1985 as 'the most corrupt' of the Afghan parties.**

The explosion would have to not only rupture both canisters, but also perfectly mix the two binary agents once released, instead of just burning them up as is much more likely.

Seriously, high explosives is a terrible payload for releasing poison gas, as it tends to just burn up the gas. Terrorist movements experimenting with chlorine gas IEDs found this out in Iraq, when their bombs barely released any of the chlorine and instead just destroyed most of it.

Regarding the territory however, if you look at the [report](http://www.un.org/zh/focus/northafrica/cwinvestigation.pdf) there were two separate impact sites (1 and 4) where the trajectory of the rockets can be accurately predicted, and they converge on a government held area.

Hezbollah isn't the only terrorist group that the regime cooperates with.

They are now the [second largest legal political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Social_Nationalist_Party#The_SSNP_in_Syria) in Syria. 

The Assad regime has in its past supported many different terror groups in the region from The Jihad Council in Lebanon, Hamas/other Palestinian terrorist groups, the PKK against Turkey, to Iraq Baathist groups/[Al Qaeda in Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fawzi_Mutlaq_al-Rawi#Iraq_War), when they were [killing American troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Abu_Kamal_raid) a decade ago. This was a major reason that so many of Syria's neighbors sent arms to opposition groups when Assad seemed so weak in 2011.

>Russians called them moderate only publicly, the ceasefire was only for the SAA to go and hunt ISIS in the east and now that ISIS is almost eliminated the SAA has gone after the main stronghold of Al-Nusra in Idlib.

So Russia and the regime are willing to negotiate and cooperate with Al-Qaeda/terrorists temporarily? That is by the narrative that you are pushing, which doesn't speak to well of either Russia or the Syrian Government. Idilb is also still controlled by a myriad of different militias, and the regime has yet to consolidate this area. I think you are meaning the Palmyra to Raqqa assault, which was a push East and not North. The major Northern push by the regime stopped in 2016, after the capture of Aleppo.

It's funny that you seem quick to attack a conspiracy source yet you have been the most invested in discussions about staged videos and now fake people.

Legitimacy confers the right and acceptance of an authority, and rebels certainly wouldn't call Assad's government legitimate. People who are pro-Assad, though, would. Legitimacy isn't an objective phenomenon. 

However, *we* can't actually say whether Assad's government is legitimate in virtue of the fact that it was ""legally"" the government. The *legal* aspect is determined by the government anyway: no government would say they themselves are illegal, otherwise they wouldn't be a government. 

This means our sense of ""legal legitimacy"" for Assad's government comes from our conceptions of some international order or *law*. This would be fine, but that can't grant legitimacy -- even if say, the UN declared Assad's government legitimate. This is because *we're* not the ones being governed by Assad. We can't speak for the political legitimacy of the government as a result. 

The upshot is that the ""legal legitimacy"" you're endorsing here is a vacuous notion. A company or an institution can have the property of being ""legally legitimate"" if the law --that is the government -- grants them this. But a government itself can't: it cannot self-certify its own legitimacy by fiat. That's something the governed decide on, which is why people are motivated to topple oppressive regimes.

The main Kurdish backers are USA and we've all seen how well that works out, and do you know how many Kurdish factions are there? Turkey supports KRG and some factions of Kurds are involved in conflicts with the PYD. The Kurds can control Rojava because most og the Population is Kurdish but if they rule from Damascus the majority Arab population will not have it, Hell they were already unhappy that Alawites were ruling a majority Sunni country.

Take the long view. In this region, the most organized opposition is almost invariably Islamists of some sort. Secular dictatorship + majority Muslim tends to go that way.

But as we've seen, dictatorships are brittle: they have a tough exterior and can persist for long periods without pressure. But when the pressure comes, the slightest crack shatters the illusion. Democratic governance has different issues: the difficulty of consensus, the slow pace of change, infighting. In many ways the two forms are opposites -- dictatorship starts strong but becomes fragile, while democracy is delicate getting off the ground, but time strengthens it.

What I'm trying to say (in a disjointed fashion) is that these revolutions need time to show us where they are going. Yes, insecurity & instability will rise in the short-term.

I'd argue that a dictator with a history of terrorist support, continuing capability to manufacture and use CW, past illicit nuclear programs, with ties to Iran and Hezbollah, and armed with newly-minted 'anti-imperialist' and anti-Western credentials poses a not insignificant threat to its neighborhood or even beyond.

With a rebel victory, we would see continuing violence among the factions - the extremists vs FSA - for years, most likely. But *within* Syria's borders (mostly). With the majority (75%) of Syrians being somewhat moderate Sunnis, there would be significant pressure on the Wahhabi/Salafi groups trying to impose an ideology with no history in the region. This situation would likely offer the West an opportunity to isolate the extremists from their arms/funds sources while arming/training the moderate factions. Thus, at incredibly small cost, the West could nudge the conflict towards favorable resolution. Won't be easy, but it's possible. Once the moderates gain a preponderance of power, outside assistance could consolidate that quickly. Later, refugees (majority Sunni) might feel safe enough to return, easing pressures on Syria's neighbors.

There is conjecture here, as in any weighing of the conflict. But there isn't much implausibility here, in my view.

I can see how this could be an interesting little psychological experiment, give younger children various powerful items, money jewels etc, once they establish the relationship between the items, you monitor and collect data on how they spend it. i bet you'll see similar results if you could analyze the personal finances of ohhh....** pick a prince,** Waleed Bin Talaal, comes easily to mind, super successful entrepreneur. not in line for succession of the thrown, but highly influential.

This kind of sloppy reporting is part of what prevented a swift resolution to the Syrian conflict in the first place. The media made it seem like this would be swift and easy if only the West intervened. They failed to take into account how high-stakes Syria was for Iran and Russia.  


When the West did intervene, and ran into trouble, no wonder they cut their losses and ran.  


What we would have needed to stop the bloodshed was massive Western military mobilization. That would have required selling the Syrian war to the public, and getting public consent. Only then could we achieve the mobilization needed to stop it. The instinctive interventionists all over the media never explained this, thinking it'd be too hard a sell. Instead, we got the worst of both worlds - neither a full blown invasion, nor a commitment to sticking to a diplomatic solution. This is the result.

The lowest estimate that is taken seriously is the Iraq Body Count - that's just all the deaths that have been publicly available in papers and websites and stuff, and that is nearly 300,000. The consensus (and the one with the strongest evidence to back it up - even the British Ministry of defence doesn't dispute it http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6495753.stm ) is the Lancet study, which is a peer-reviewed academic journal of the highest possible standard, used to publish the results of medical tests and public health crises and so on.

He's moderately entertaining to watch, does get a little too.. mn... aggressive at times for my taste? but ultimately he's got a great way of breaking down stories to show what the crux of the issues are and why the corporate news is presenting a story the way that they do.

People from warzones will however be ""tolerated individuals"", they can stay until the situation in their home nation is considered safe.

The point is this: yes, environmental influence is important, but it's not everything.  50% of responsibility goes to the internal human factors, inside the person.  50% goes to the external environmental factors, outside the person.  Both work together to produce the result.  While you can argue for unfavorable externals, the internals are always free.  There is always opportunity.  The heroes of thought are always welcome to leave their mark in all circumstances, with or without consent, with or without support, thanks to or despite the environment.

Middle East can't bitch about being uniquely disadvantaged.  They are just whiny stupid bitches.  Others rose to challenge while Muslims sit on their ass and smack their foreheads.

The point is not that I want to nuke anyone.  The point is that we must put an end to the politics of threats.  I am not looking forward to nuking anyone.  In fact I want peace.  I want tolerance.  Islam is a radical and intolerant doctrine that's making peace very difficult.  While I prefer peace, I am not Ghandi.

I am also saying I am prepared for any and all consequences, including nuclear war and the destruction of this very planet.  Nothing scares me.

The government is also winning the war against the FSA they have the FSA encircled everywhere and if the FSA falls they will most likely slaughter ISIS since ISIS manpower wise is the weakest out of everyone the government hasn't even bother to do any real offensive on ISIS yet either rather focus on the bigger FSA threat. 

Also the Kurds don't have any real friends in the area Turkey is obviously not supporting them at all, unless the YPG is banking on Iraqi Kurds crossing the border without caring and helping which i doubt to be honest cause that would mean hostility with Iran which i doubt Iraqi Kurds want.

The current oil crises and people just running out of gas is a huge issue but also something that isn't unexpected. We can talk about if Assad is the literal devil that he gets painted as or not day in day out, one might argue that his actions were to some degree dictated by the situation he found himself in. It's however also hard to argue that he's a good guy, conducting the civil war in a humane way.

The only two forces the US is currently at war with is Daesh who are decimated to small insurgency cells and recently they struck against HTS and the Al-Qaeda network in Idlib which still seems to be a one off. If Germany or anyone else would go into Syria in a supporting roll to the US that would compose primarily in a) training the local forces and b) giving support against Daesh insurgency forces. 

If you think the Kurds, who want the support of the west, are better off fending for themselves against Erdogan sponsored TFSA, the murderous dictator that is Assad backed by Russian fighter-bombers and helicopters that is fine. Questionable but I accept your opinion. 

As for your second point, you seem under the false assumption that gaining momentum is the same as taking over. Of course Germany is mostly pro-European and doesn't have an issue with migrants - that doesn't stop the AfD from sitting at some 14% nation wide, 19% in Brandenburg and 25% in Saxony. The later they thankfully fucked up because of incompetency in registering their members for the vote which most likely will result in them getting far fewer seats than they would have gotten. Also notable is the move to the right from the CDU/CSU in reaction to the AfD to reclaim voters.

>Far-right parties gained considerable support in many
European countries in the wake of the European refugee crisis in 2014 and 2015. These parties appeal to
fears and anti-immigrant sentiments in the native population. The strong positive correlation between the
number of arriving refugees and support for far-right
parties over time suggests a positive effect of the refugee crisis on support for far-right parties. Refugee
migration may impact support for far-right parties on
the one hand through factors that only vary over time,
but little over smaller geographical areas (macro-level).
General fiscal concerns or the salience of the refugee
situation in media outlets are examples of this type of
factors. On the other hand, it may work through exposure that occurs if refugees are located in geographical
proximity to voters (micro-level).

They had to say that back then as the [Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 wasn't fully passed yet](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/), which was legally banning them from approaching domestic audiences with their propaganda, the easiest solution to that was to just cut out the English language.  


But in case people have forgotten: The NSA also wasn't supposed to large scale surveil on a US domestic level, how much of a fuck did they give about that particular rule? Right, exactly zero were given.

I guess you honestly think the US military is above such simply applications of ""troll farms"" as these kinds of tactics are supposedly only reserved to evil rogue states like Russia or China, just like assassinating ""enemies of the state"" is an exclusively ""[evil guy thing](https://archive.org/details/cia-assassination-manual)"".  


>I'll tell you who did spread propaganda though, other than RT and the regime, there was Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The fact that we share the same language with them has allowed those states' narratives to dominate.

Which is also the reason why [anti-Shia sentiments were stoked](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06DAMASCUS5399_a.html) to prevent Iranian influence from creeping up, but at the same time these very same sentiments also fueled Sunni extremist movements like ISIS.

>Political   observers,   the   media,   and   politicians   themselves have speculated that the refugee situation helped to fuel support for the far-right. The refugee sit-uation may have affected voting for the far-right based on  concerns  driven  by  macro-level  exposure  (e.g.,  the  salience  of  the  refugee  situation  in  (social)  media  and  political  rhetoric)  and  micro-level  exposure  (e.g.,  per-sonal    interactions    with    and    observation  of  refugees).  Both  levels   of   exposure   may   have   influenced    voting    decisions.

However,   hosting   of   refugees   in   a   municipality combined with efforts to facilitate inter-action  between  locals  and  refugees  has  the  opposite  effect; and the resulting micro-exposure reduces sup-port for the Freedom Party. 

Your own source says that immigration can both increase or decrease support for far-right parties, and that where it increases the support, this is mostly due to how the issue is framed in the public disourse, while actual interaction with refugees decreases support for the far right.

The international forces acting under a clear UN mandate were to liberate Kuwait, which they did, and this involved going into Iraq. They never went to Baghdad though

In the aftermath George H Bush encouraged the marsh arabs in the south, and the Kurds in the north to rise up in popular rebellion against Saddam Hussein; ""no one will shed a tear"". For about 2 or 3 weeks Saddam's fate hung in the balance but he slowly succeeded in re-establishing control


This led to retribution and a humanitarian crisis as the persecuted fled. NATO responded by creating no fly zones which allowed fledgling groups like Ansar-al-Islam to begin getting a toe-hold in Iraq. Previously Saddam had been able to quash these groups as he recognised the threat that popular Islam posed to him. 


In the cities other radical Islamist groups (or conservative if we're honest about it, they aren't really radical) started to appear, notably those led by Sadr (father of the cleric who would come to prominence later). These were also suppressed

7732,"Yes, but right now the French are both unable to win or end the war in Syria. The French military has been on continuous active deployment ever since WWII, so when an officer, and an artillery one at that, say they need boots on the ground, then I reckon they know what they're talking about. The same issue applied to both the Afghan and Iraq occupations - not enough specialist personnel (EOD, interpreters, negotiators, etc) to protect and maintain relations with locals, and not enough soldiers and equipment to actually send after rebels/insurgents. Instead, massive contracts were doled out for PMCs to escort VIPs, and local security forces were largely concentrated in government strongholds. In the meantime undermanned and underequipped ISAF personnel conducted patrols throughout their zones of responsibility with limited support from headquarters.

It's commonly said that the US forces in Afghanistan and Iraq have done more to destabilize the area than any local power, but that's only in the context of dismantling the local militaries and firing all their personnel. When it comes to maintaining regional stability the coalition nations have done their fair share by deploying troops to their areas of responsibilities, at least as permitted by their own legislative assemblies.

More recently the West and Russia have learned that the deployment of conventional troops is too big of a political matter to even consider, so for Syria they sent in consultants and special forces to aid favoured parties, and provided long range artillery and air support to prop them up. However the French literally wrote the book on conducting 20th century counterinsurgencies, and they know better than any other nation about the importance of gaining the consensus of involved parties when it comes to conflict resolution. That is obviously not happening as the US and Russia are pitting their proxy forces against each other. With both local rebels and government forces exhausting resources and manpower, no parties are able to ensure regional stability, which is something both the US and Russia could have provided to their favoured parties from the beginning by putting boots on the ground. I don't see a withdrawal happening until the US and Russia reach a consensus on Syria, but as no troops have been committed to Syria, the resulting vacuum will attract other parties to the area, creating a perpetuating cycle of conflict.

If both the US and Russia had deployed conventional troops to the conflict, they could at least maintain security while the local government and rebel forces reach a resolution.

Invading Iraq/Afghanistan/etc or even blockading essential resources like they're doing today in Venezuela without admitting to any real responsibility for their actions has let many American presidents shirk dealing with the outcomes of their actions for decades now.  Would the US have done a better job with Iraq if they were declaring it the new Puerto Rico?  Probably not; it would likely be best if the US and Europe didn't get involbed in the region in the 1st place (though, not being an expert on the region, I'm only going off my leanings towards isolationism), but if invasion was inevitable would it have been better for Iraq if president Bush 1.0 said the whole country was Americas responsibility to rebuild?

Probably not.  Puerto Rico's a perfect example of American imperialism failing, even at its best; it's had a messy history and Trumps disinterest in it, probably because it's too Latin and won't vote for him, has proven that a single indiferrent America President is enough to leave the country in shambles.

I remember in my undergrad days, about a year after Iraq 2.0 happened, my prof argued that Bush + friends were what happened when you gave ideologues power over foreign affairs.  The narrative I leaned towards, at the time, was that it was all about oil and war profiteering.  My prof argued that most governments, as long as they were rational and/or realist, would look at what Sadam was doing and conclude that getting involved wasn't worth it, but the Neocons genuinely believed that they could spread democracy by invading the place and introducing free market ideas.  The neocons were obv wrong.  As for my prof, I don't know if his idea of what happened was right, but it was an interesting perspective on the matter and left me with the idea that a lot of bad things *could* have been done by people with the best of intentions, and that often makes them worse.

Regardless endless war and meddling in the affairs of the world strike me as bad ideas.  But my knowledge and beliefs may be fallible.

>""I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. We have definitely adopted the position at [the Peace Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919) of arguing in favour of the retention of gas as a permanent method of warfare. It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at making his eyes water by means of [lachrymatory gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tear_gas).

>I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses: gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of those affected.

What has was he talking about? Riot gas didn't exit then. The pro-Churchil website talk about chlorine and attempt to dismiss its lethality, claiming that only 4% of soldiers exposed to the gas in WWI died.

So Churchill was likely talking about chlorine, there was no other agent available. Chlorine is relatively harmless if used out in the open, people can run away. 

This is likely the exact same reason chlorine is used by Syrian government forces, it's used to domoralise and frighten the rebels rather than to kill. 

CS Gas was invented till 1927, after he wrote the 1919 memo, and it wasn't used for riot control until the 1950s-60s.

While CS Gas wasn't banned in war initially, the Chemical Weapons Convention latterly baned the use of Riot control agents i.e. CS gas in war.

>Riot control agents (RCAs) such as CS were the topic of long and heated debates during CWC negotiations. At issue were their inclusion in the treaty and the restrictions that would be imposed upon their use. In the end, a compromise was reached under which States Parties are to declare to the OPCW the RCAs they possess for law enforcement purposes. Though use is allowed for these purposes, it is prohibited as a method of warfare.

I say this as a person who is opposed to American hedgemony, but the US was a pretty good hedgemon for certain areas of the world for a period 1945/50-1970ish. Obviously they were pretty shit for lots of the world. But for Europe, and a select few states elsewhere, the US brought the Marshall plan, Bretton Woods, the IMF, World Bank and WTO. It put its diplomatic and economic muscle behind freer trade, economic stability, and debt relief. It also helped defend its allies well (Berlin, Korea). 

As time went on US power lessened, and US hedgemony became less benevolent. Interventions became more agressive and imperialist. Their economic strength was turned to sucking in vast amounts of capital and goods (the US used to have a huge trade surplus and send the profits of that back out to the world through aid and investment, now they have a huge trade deficit and suck the money back through an unstable financial system.*) The US is not capable of ruling benevolently anymore, but they were good once, for some.

Quick hitters on what to expect out of the book, compared to the movie:

More detail on Gust, Joanne and Mike Vickers.  They get at least a chapter on where they came from and how they go to be them.  Gust is a hell of a story himself.  His story is pretty wild.  Basically, him going to war with that guy in the office (window guy) because the CIA Yale types didn't like the new breed of CIA street types, and Gust for his part held a lifelong resentment towards what he considered ""silver spoon"" types and the condescension they always treated him with.  So window guy had been itching to fire him, but out of sight out of mind, so Gust spend literally a year ducking the guy, staying on whatever floor he wasn't on, coming and going at different times, until he could find a project to put himself on so he was couldn't be let go.  Eventually he got wind of the Russia thing, and slid into ""acting lead"" on the project long enough that they had to make him the actual lead, leaving window guy furious but unable to do anything about it.

A nice deep dive on how government works behind closed doors.  Actually going into detail on HOW Charlie pulled off the stuff he did.  While the movie sort of goes an inch deep on how Charlie was well liked, held a lot of IOU's, knew people, talked smooth, etc, the book explains how Charlie was, while not ""important"" on paper, was extremely intelligence, had great people skills, and very deliberately knew how to get next to the right people to have his hands on the right strings. (Example, he knew damn well the amount of influence he gained by being on both the intelligence and defense committees.  He pushed for those positions).

&nbsp;

One story I will point out from the book, as an example:  The movie makes a humorous reference in the beginning to Charlie Wilson getting a spot on the House ethics committee.  Later the movie makes passing references to Charlie having influence with (I believe) Tipper Gore and later John Murtha (the key votes he would need to keep getting money for the war.)

&nbsp;

The book explains it outright.  See, some sort of secret probe into bribery and other misdeeds by members of congress had just blown up.  Its was looking BAD.  An ethics committee was called and it seemed a bunch of people were going to get kicked out of congress.

&nbsp;

Their party wanted to step in and save them, but going to bat for people who'd been caught red handed taking bribes was career suicide.  Well, Gore realized that Charlie could be their guy.  He had a low political profile, a secure hold on his seat, and a reputation for being the free wheeling, somehow likeably shady, NON-choir boy in town.  He was the only person who could go into that committee with a ""oh come on guys, let's give them a break"" attitude, and not get roasted for it.  Like, ""sigh... that's Charlie for you""

&nbsp;

So Gore puts Charlie on the committee, with the ""kill this disciplinary stuff"" task wink wink nod unsaid.

8409,"The US -did- actually have a lot to do with the start of the Arab Spring, but it was far more indirectly than you'd think.

The initial protests in the Arab Spring were largely in response to rising prices of grains - governments across the region generally subsidized the provision of grains, but the price rose to a point that the governments had trouble maintaining the previous level of subsidy. That's what sparked the initial wave of protests; these tended to snowball once they got going, except in those countries with enough budgetary room to buy off their constituents.

Why'd the price of grain go up? Because the US was producing fewer grains, because we'd recently implemented a program to add ethanol to gasoline - ostensibly because it would assist in fighting global warming, though pretty much everyone on both sides knew that it wasn't actually of any help in that respect, and ultimately it came down to being a giveaway to corn farmers in politically-advantaged areas.

So, in a very real sense, what tipped over that particular anthill was US environmental policy, as modified by US domestic politics. Had we not decided that it was our environmental duty to grow corn and then set fire to it, the price of grains may not have increased, the Tunisian protests wouldn't have started the avalanche, and all sorts of other things may or may not have resulted from there.

Point being the uprising was never about values such as liberty or democracy. It was only about balance of power between Alawites/the Al-Assad dynasty and the islamists. *Free Syrian Army* was just a convenient alias for the islamists to gain Western sympathy that was successfully translated into military assistance.

Interestingly enough, the ""New State"" was the big problem.  ""New Management"" would have been fine.

The thing is it is just not politically viable to commit that amount of ressources to afghanistan, to fully control the country and build a state.

It is also much simpler from a cultural point for the US to understand germany because german culture is much closer to american culture than Afghan culture.

8517,"No, Assad isn't loved because he is in power democratically, the proof that Assad is loved by a large segment of the population is due to the fight or die attitude so many Syrians showed for his cause from 2012-2015.

The attitudes of the men in SAA held Aleppo, Dier Ez Zor, the Al-Tabqa, Abu Duhur & Kuweires airbases, Nubul & Zahra, al-Fu'ah and Kafriya, Al Kindi hospital, shows popular support for the regime's cause. In each of these places, the SAA & civilians literally fought to the death under siege *for years*, with food and ammunition only arriving via air drop. They weren't ""Assadist flunkies"" trying to cling to their power, they were poor people (elites become chair officers) literally showing their support by refusing to surrender in the face of absolute death. And of course, the defenders of Tabqa, Abu Duhur, Al Kindi, were eventually overrun and slaughtered, but these *conscripts* (not mukhabarat or rich Damascene elites) of all religions and classes did not accept any of their many offers of surrender, it is absolute proof of the facts of popular support for Assad. 

When Kuweires was saved, which was under siege from 2013-2015, there were only 300 air cadets left alive, out of an original 1100. We are talking about young 18-20 something conscripts, teenagers who were only in the service for a few weeks. Why the hell did they fight so hard, why didn't they accept any term of surrender, especially during the period from 2013-2014 where the SAA was at it's weakest, losing Idlib, losing ground in Damascus, losing Tabqa, losing Division 13 in Raqqa, etc? Why didn't they (or couldn't they) surrender and leave for Turkey, when they were only young enlisted men earning small salaries, not 30-40 year old Mukhabarat/Shabiha mob boss millionaires & their employees?

Areas across Syria like Latakia and Tartus for a while faced a shortage of young men, families were giving every one of their sons to various militias and the regular army. The NDF, who *could not be deployed outside of their home region*, and served as home defense, grew to hundreds of thousands of men.

Assad is loved because millions of Syrians genuinely believe and fear that they will be slaughtered to a man, like in Kessab. And if this were not a legitimate fear to be had, then why on Earth did the rebels besiege  al-Fu'ah and Kafriya? The defenders of those towns were the inhabitants, not soldiers, the only goal was to kill all of them, because the inhabitants were Shiites.

During the last rebel Hama offensive of 2017, we saw the Sunni inhabitants of Qomhana form the Tigers of Qamahana, repelling the HTS assault on their town.

In 2015, the Guardians of the Dawn was formed of Christian civilians to defend their towns in the al Ghab and Hama plains from rebel attacks. Why don't they just let the rebels advance past them to Hama? Why do poor Christian farmers arm themselves in defense of a 'tyrant'? In general, why have so many towns formed their own pro-government defensive militias, instead of just letting the rebels get Assad, who only rules 'because of a small elite that keeps everyone else in line?'

It is undeniable that many tribes and families have pledged their support to the government, otherwise they would have not survived the 2012 Battle of Damascus, nor would Government held Aleppo survive a state of siege until Operation Canopus Star. Sections of every sector of Syrian society has shown their support for the government, we are talking about entire tribal towns miles from the closest government installation, fathers and sons, resisting rebels at the threat of beheading, when they could have just let the rebels march on, deposing the 'tyrant'.

As I said before, the wide scale violent resistance wasn't immediate, and anyway if we'd gone in with enough troops to assume total control I don't think they  wouldn't have been able to resist on a large scale. The religious fanatics may never have been able to wield so much influence as there would be no power vacuum.

I agree it's not easy to make the comparison because it's hard to establish cause and effect, and we can't say for certain one way or the other because no two countries are the same and you can't try both methods on one nation.
