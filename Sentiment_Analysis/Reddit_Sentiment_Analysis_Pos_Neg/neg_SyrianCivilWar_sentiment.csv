1021,"I should clarify, I don't think we should intervene now - or at least, I have nowhere near the level of knowledge about the complex situation to say so. As I see it, the situation has devolved into the chaos it is in now because there was no prompt action from the international community. I think, that before this became a civil war, we had the opportunity to prevent it escalating. I'm not talking about regime change. If we had just prevented the butchery of the protesters, through UN action or military intervention, there wouldn't have been a war. The government probably wouldn't have collapsed, either. It would have been a stalemate, and instead of Jihadi thugs having the loudest voice, the pro-democracy movement would have had centre stage. Instead, we fumbled around and couldn't even muster any strong condemnation from the UN owing to the self-interest of Russia and the Chinese. This allowed Assad to continue to ramp up his use of force until the only thing we *could* do was to arm the rebels, so as to prevent another massacre on the scale of Hama. Now we have the worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century and a conflict which still threatens to engulf the region in chaos. 

People like to say that's our fault, but I believe that people have the right to defend themselves from brutal murderers like Assad.

Well hard ass doesn't want to come down a penny and there is no way we are going to pay that much for a knockoff so the deals a bust. We tell the guy he can keep his watches for that price.

Iraq's borders were determined by the League of Nations in 1920 after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Iraq's borders completely ignore internal ethnic and sectarian struggles, and it was necessary to have a strongman in charge to provide internal and regional stability. The US invasion in 2003 completely dismantled the Iraqi state, and it has been weak and vulnerable ever since.
It may be time for the West to rethink the concept of stability in the Middle East. It was designed to be unstable, leading to the emergence of despotic dictators such as Assad and Hussein. The Arab Spring and Western interventions have since removed from power or have directly challenged most of these dictators.

The results of the US backed funding of Islamic Extremist terrorist groups and the US invasion of Iraq

Iraq has been a bloodbath for a decade, it's economy and infrastructure have been ruined. Over 500,000 Iraqi's have died during the US occupation, millions have been displaced. Numerous major birth defects and other illnesses are being reported due to the US using depleted uranium in Fallujah. The US also used white phosphorus, which is banned as a chemical weapon under the Geneva convention. N.B. Iraq was never ""pacified"" by a troop surge as the Neocons claim. The Sunni's were bribed with billions of US tax dollars to keep quiet for a while - but this bribe money has now dried up.

The CIA engineered civil war in Libya, in support of Islamic Extremists from Benghazi, has turned Libya into a bloodbath with various armed militias shooting each other. It's economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins.

The CIA engineered Syrian civil war has turned Syria into a bloodbath with 140,000 (on both sides) killed. Syria's economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins. Millions have been displaced and have fled as refugees. The Islamic Extremists (which comprise almost all of the actively fighting ""rebels"") have been losing the war against Assad in Syria so they have now turned their attention back to Iraq with some major gains by ISIS including taking over $400m from Iraqi banks (we await further developments).

The US war against Pakistan has killed hundreds of innocent civilians with drone strikes including 170 children.

The civil war in Yemen where the US has used cruise missiles, cluster bombs and drone strikes in support of a corrupt dictator has turned Yemen into a bloodbath.

Boku Haram which is covertly funded and armed by the US proxy Saudi Arabia, via islamic extremists in Libya is murdering christians in Nigeria.

Mali's legitimate government was overthrown in a joint US & French military coup in 2012 to be replaced by a puppet President trained by the US at military bases in the US.

The Afghan poppy crop which had been reduced by 90% with the Taleban's ban in 2000 is now greater than ever. More Afghans are now subject to drugs warlords (of which Karzai & his brother are both major ones). Afghanistan remains a bloodbath and a hot civil war.

A semi stable government in Somalia was overthrown by Ethiopia in a US backed coup. Somalia is in chaos, with elements of this chaos murdering innocent civilians in Kenya.

More than 200 million more people now support Islamic Extremism than they did in 2005.

Ukraine has been turned into a civil war zone by a US engineered illegal Coup D'Etat in Kiev. Ukraine is joining Iraq, Syria and Libya in the utter misery, violence, death and poverty that comes with US ""liberation"".

It wouldn't be quite so bad, if the nett result of all this US mega stupidity wasn't the ruining of the US economy and the very dramatic quickening of the end of the petrodollar system and the end of American hegemony to hand over the reins of power to a SE Asia dominated world, centered on China - with Russia, the Brics, Africa and South America as allies.",-0.0058851565101565115,negative,Syrian Civil War,0.49705742174492173,negative

Behind the scenes in the US, the Obama administration has been caught in a no-win scenario.

This is not correct.  There is no such thing as a homogeneous rebel group in Syria which has morphed into ISIS. There are dozens of factions fighting the Assad regime and they are also fighting each other.  The U.S. did not give weapons to ISIS.  They gave weapons to the FSA which has been in direct combat with ISIS and other extremist militant groups.

The 80% of western fighters who joined ISIS does not refer to fighters on the western front but fighters from the West (e.g. Europe, North America).

Who knew? Also from the same BBC article: ""In January 2014, rebels from both Western-backed and Islamist groups launched an offensive against ISIS, seeking to drive its predominantly foreign fighters out of Syria.""

Second of all, my position has nothing to do with liking Obama or wanting foreign intervention.  You are forgetting that long before foreign jihadis showed up on the scene, Syrian civilians staged demonstrations against the Assad family which has been in power in Syria for 30+ years.  Ignoring the fact that there are a sizable number of Syrians against Assad, who aren't religious fanatics or blood thirsty terrorists, is an insult to Syrians who have been suffering under bombardments of barrel bombs, starved and imprisoned because they live in areas that were strongholds of resistance against Assad's dictatorship.  Take a look at the pictures of Homs.  The whole city is dust.  Over a million people have been displaced to refugee camps. It's foolishness to believe that all this was the result of fighting a few thousand radical jihadis.  It may not be the right thing to arm moderate groups in Syria, but it's disingenuous to state that the U.S. is arming ISIS when that's not the case.

These scenes are then interspersed with videos showing ""recruitment and liberation"" of Sunnis.

You will also notice that the militants sometimes dress in uniforms.  These are Iraqi Army uniforms.  They do this to gain entrance to homes without a fight, or even to set up fake checkpoints.

That is interesting but the website doesn't provide a source. I'm not saying it's impossible, I've just yet to find a verifiable source that it occurred. As I mentioned before, however, the point is completely irrelevant. The vast majority of the mujahideen were not interested in the Wahabist movement and in fact there was quite bad blood between Al Qaeda and other groups within the Mujahideen.

>I don't confuse them, I know the difference, and I find that difference to be marginal in the moral and definitional sense.

Your oppinion really doesn't matter. Most experts agree that Al Qaeda was disliked by most of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan. They were viewed as war tourists who had no reason to be in Afghanistan. The average muja was not a wahabist.

>Why are you utterly full of it? There are jihadist in every sense of the word. It's in their freaking name.

The term Mujahideen is inappropriate in the context of Afghanistan, but it's simply the word that was used to describe the anti-Soviet fighters. The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of the Mujahideen who fought against the soviets were not Wahabist or Jihadists. They were local born fighters repelling an invading enemy. If they picked up and Jihadist rhetoric along the way it was likely from northern Pakistani Pashtuns under heavy influence from Saudi Wahabist clerics operating free ""schools"" out of Pakistan. It is likely the average Muja simply went along with this rhetoric, the vast majority did not become Taliban or Wahabists.

>because they were funded and trained INDIRECTLY by the CIA.

The ISI was training local Afghani fighters to repel the Soviet invasion force. Do you honestly think that all 140,000 or so soldiers trained by the ISI became hardcore wahabist fighters? No. The vast majority were regular people who went back to their regular lives after the war.

>I prefer to listen to the prime minister of Pakistan, now dead because of jihadist infiltration in the Pakistani government and especially the ISI.

The ISI is a border-line Jihadist organization. It created the Taliban. They weren't infiltrated, they invited the Jihadists in.

>Before that? I blame Zbigniew Brzezinski and Jimmy Carter, Charlie Wilson and Ronald Reagan. And men like Gust Avrakotos.

Wahabism was not born out of thin air when the CIA decided to sent money and weapons to locally born fighters in Afghanistan. Sorry, that story is not substantiated by ANY historian or expert.

Painfully dishonest? You're the one trying to pass off an SAS fan website as a primary source (lol). Then, time and time again you try and connect the CIA to Al Qaeda and the Taliban and you simply cannot do so because the link does not exist. Every single respected historian and regional expert agrees that the ties between CIA funding and training and Al Qaeda or the Taliban are scant if non-existant. **The Taliban was created AFTER the CIA left Afghanistan**. Al Qaeda **had plenty of funding from Saudi sources, and the CIA outright says that the locals disliked AQ and didn't play nice with them because they were seen as war tourists** So you have nothing...you're wrong. No one agrees with you except Pakistani politicians with an agenda and tinfoil hats who hate the United States.

Let me break down the conversation for you, and how you've utterly lost every step of the way:

The original point of contention was: the USA created Islamic Terrorism. 

My response was: No, Wahabist Islam existed well before the USA became involved in Afghanistan and no direct training or money has ever connected members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban to the CIA (even money funneled through the ISI).

So, how you have failed:

1. You fail to connect the average Soviet-era Afghani rebel fighter to the Wahhabist movement(the core of the modern jihad movement). Just because they called themselves Mujahideen does not mean they considered themselves part of the Wahabist movement. Furthermore, Wahabism caused the dissolution of the coalition that fought the soviets as soon as the soviets were defeated. 

2. You fail to prove that CIA money was given directly to any Wahabist sect operating in Afghanistan despite mountains of evidence from numerous sources to the contrary. 

3. You refuse to accept that the ISI is a Wahabist influenced organization that is by and large responsible for the explosive growth of the Taliban and AQ post-US withdrawal of funding.

4. You refuse to acknowledge that the Taliban didn't even exist until after the withdrawal of us funding and training in Afghanistan.

5. You refuse to admit that AQ is a Saudi Funded, Saudi trained operation with ties to radical clerics associated with rich people in Saudi Arabia

6. You refuse to acknowledge that Wahabism was created well before Operation Cyclone and that its primary purveyors (Al Qaeda and associated groups) have always operated independently of regional conflicts. They simply take advantage of regional conflicts to justify their horrible acts of violence and subjugation.

>You don't think we are suddenly interested in Syria because we care about human rights abuses, do you?

I think Russia is interested in Syria because it's their only military base in the Mediterranean and their only warm-water naval base in general.

I believe the United States is against both of those. As in, the limiting of Russian military influence and power projection, as well as the possibility of establishing a pipeline through Syria directly to Europe. 

I also believe that the United States wish's to set a precedent when it comes to the use of chemical weapons, hence Obama's *""red line""* and the reason he's agreed to the present disarmament deal, even if it means giving up on the other two objectives I listed above.

Well, that is to be expected when the Assad regime was using chemical weapons including sarin gas initially until we appeared to be on the brink of taking military action with ships off the coast, but then our Congress (with American pressure weary of getting involved in yet another country) voted no. The Russians got politically involved at that point worrying about potential American involvement and made the Syrians destroy much of their sarin gas, but they just moved on to using chlorine gas I believe.

Aside from that, Russia got militarily involved a few months ago (September I believe) and the Assad regime has been indiscriminately bombing in order to create a refugee crisis which would make it easier for the regime to eventually kill all of their enemies with Russian support. This is why Russia has been attacking the rebels closest to Assad-controlled territory and not the eastern part of the nation where ISIS is located.

This civil war started because civilians opposed the regime during Arab spring (March 2011). Assad deployed the army and ordered a massive crackdown on a peaceful demonstration in Hama causing hundreds of civilians to be killed (May 2011). Regime forces start cracking down peaceful demonstrations in Damascus (Feb 2012) and regime troops push into Homs to terrorize civlians opposing the Assad regime (April 2012).

Then in July 2012 Assad regime starts bombing civilians and the UN (Aug 2012) accuses Syria of war crimes. By Nov 2012 Rebel groups start to form to oppose the relentless Assad regime.

His enemies are STILL relying on the Kalashnikov and the Soviet-era RPG; yes, tanks and a few artillery pieces have been captured, but the lack of logistics severely limits their effectiveness. More salient than this, though, is that his forces fired the first round, tortured the first prisoner, deployed the first (likely only) chemical agents, and razed the first cities.

As for the reports which abound, it is dependent on where your news comes from. Plus, since the question is not whether or not Assad should go, but whether or not we should back the rebels, it is logical for the media to focus on rebels.

But which is more evil depends on your focus. I focus on what this all means for international security. Others may buy Assad's 'anti-imperialist' rhetoric.

He serves as intermediary to Iran, a dictatorial theocracy with a history of dishonesty and bad behavior, and handles weapons for Hezbollah, a group which has attacked Israel several times and violated agreements to disarm or join Lebanon's military.

No.  A democracy is a rule by consent (simplified).  If a bunch of dicks come together and civilly consent to a common rule, that's what evil democracy is like.  So for example, a bunch of people can come together and democratically agree and consent to a law that says ""anyone who offends Islam must die.""  Such a law can easily be enacted through a democratic process.  That would be an evil democracy.

Democracy makes sure that the government is not too far away from the culture it represents.  If the culture that participates in a democracy is an evil one, then all their consensual, participatory democratic laws and governance will be evil.  Such laws and governance will simply be representative of the dominant culture.

First, I don't really want to nuke any country.  My actual doctrine toward ignorant countries is to practice control and containment.  Just limit the damage the ignorant ones can cause outside their own country.  Basically make the countries of ignorant fools to be like zoo cages.  Let them live as they wish inside their cage.  If they want to evolve and learn, we can let them out of the cage.  If they continue to be ignorant, let them remain and let them not carry their diseased mind around the world.  So basically let them live but don't let them spread out.  We can even trade with them, just that we have to be careful not to give them toys they can't yet handle.

I would say this is the thought process that imperialism is made of. You invade a country, cause a bunch of problems, then say ""oh well we can't just leave, the problems will get worse if we just leave"" and so the soldiers stay permanently. Then hey maybe theres a ""problem"" in a neighboring country and weve already got troops stationed next door.

Eventually you are the American Empire with military bases at every corner of earth and the flimsy pretexts for war are rolling in daily.

I see this as the US attempting to get its allies to do the dirty work of a long occupation. The US occupied Afghanistan and Iraq for a long ass time and it was expensive and fruitless. Iraq is now an Iranian ally and Afghanistan is on the brink of being reconquered by the Taliban.

His question to the Obama admin was; do we have any contingency plans if Iran uses their newly found finances to influence/fund bad actors in the region? The Obama admin didn't have an answer. He kept driving questions like these home, and he made enemies. Iran begun to do exactly what Mattis feared that they would do, and we had no real plan in place if this did happen.

The King/Queen of England did a lot of terrible things by proxy during the age of British empire, but at least, the whole time, they spoke about their colonies with a sense of responsibility.

""NK""

Because China supports NK and would retaliate against a U.S. or South Korean invasion, China posesses nuclear weapons and NK does as well, and North Korea could kill an absolute ass fuck of people in Seoul before their artillary and missile capabilities were eliminated.

""Saudi Arabia""

And the United States doesn't intervene in Saudi Arabia because it is a U.S. ally in the region, and the government largely sees support from the citizens who live there. Intervention in Saudi Arabia would mean invading a U.S. ally, which would not only upset other U.S. allies around the globe who could see themselves as the next Saudi Arabia, but would also likely mean engaging in an unnecessary guerilla war against the people of Saudi Arabia. I do not support the fact that the United States is an ally of SA, but understanding why the U.S. does not intervene there is simple.

""Rohingya Genocide""

To be clear, the U.S. did withdraw military assistance in Myanmar in responce to the ethnic cleansing, and has provided 300 million in aid to Rohingya refugees. I do believe, however, that it should in fact intervene in Myanmar to stop the genocide. The U.S. house of representatives has denounced the violence as a genocide as of December of last year. You must of course be aware that the Syrian civil war was ongoing for nearly three years before the U.S. intervened? There is no civil war to take advantage of in Myanmar (EDIT: To clarify, I mean a civil war on the same scale as the one which occured and is ongoing in Syria. There is of course an insurgency in Myanmar, but based on the research I have done, the rebels are not nearly as widespread.), and a war would mean pitting the U.S. military directly against the military of Myanmar and any allies.  Addionally, while the genocide is horrible and should be stopped, it is not a direct threat to the united states and european allies in the same way that ISIS is. The difference in the two situations is simple enough that a child could understand it.
