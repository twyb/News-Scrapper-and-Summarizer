To answer your points directly
1) Im not actually sure specifically what you mean here. Who would could pay more than we can? Why would they pay the cost to export etc when demand domestically would be plenty high. If worse came to worse we would just outlaw exporting crude oil again. 

2) Again im not sure what this sentence means. We would still be able to fuel ships etc and companies would procure fuel on the global market if we could not. Its not like the us government owns the ships that carry goods. I doubt most of those ships get their oil in the US as it is. Price of goods may rise though. 

3) Again we are talking about a really small amount of oil here. Iran's oil not on the market just isn't producing some global power shift to Russia. Their production and exports have been down anyway so even if they went back up some no big deal.

You're not offended yet you claim that all ""decent"" people should be embarrassed about a meme that you don't enjoy because it didn't come from the twitter account of your preferred politician.  

This is why people are increasingly turned off by both sides.  Neither side can realize how easy it is to spot their hysterics whenever they don't get their way.  

Cruz for instance dropped a fun halloween tweet about the meme that he's the Zodiac killer, something utterly prepostorous.  Yet people managed to get offended and claimed he was disrespecting the victims by being self deprecating.  

Many of the people who were mad had it pointed out that they joyously took part in the meme during the 2016 presidential election.  

I'm sorry, but anybody who claims to be offended by this tweet is in my opinion very obviously not offended, but merely trying to stir up sentiment in their favor.  Because let's be honest, a GoT meme is fun.  Unless it's somebody you don't like saying it.  In which case it's evil, vile, insert bullshit adjective here.

TL;DR:  Anybody honestly made about a meme is dumb.  Anybody claiming to be mad but actually not is a hypocrite.  Those are the only two camps you have to choose from.

736,"So the strategy Obama and the rest of the world wanted to take with Iran was to make a deal that would essentially deradicalize Iran and end their possible need to create nuclear weapons. 

The terms placed on Iran were that they would have to seriously reduce their nuclear energy program (which was thought to also include a nuclear weapons program) to the point that it's insurable and allow inspectors from the IAEA full rights to regularly inspect all of Iran to ensure no nuclear materials were being create and no weapons program existed. In exchange, the US and all other members of the agreement, would lift sanctions and allow companies to invest in Iran's economy. 

The plan was that, over the course of the 20 or so years the deal would apply, Iran would economically develop and integrate with the world economy in such a way that going for nukes would be unecessary and counter productive. At the same time, this would deradicalize the country by showing that the West is not evil and can be reasoned with, which was part of the platform that their current moderate president was running on. 

Since the deal has been signed, Iran has complied with everything its asked for and no inspectors have discovered any increases in their nuclear energy stockpiles or any weapons program. 

The problem now with Trump bringing back the sanctions is that it's essentially proving the radicals in Iran right--that the US cannot be trusted and is out to get them. It was a real watershed moment when the  moderates won with a positive view of the West. So placing sanctions on for no reason completely ruined everything the moderates there succeeded in achieving and basically guarantees that the radicals in Iran will win future  elections because they benefit from America being the bad guy. 

Additionally, despite the fact that the US didn't officially ratify the agreement through Congress, all other countries in the agreement essentially see this as the US going back on their word and undermining the deal they spent years negotiating to create. Some are even circumventing the US's decision, like China and the EU, because of how valuable they think the deal is and how stupid the US is being. So the fact that the US is basically undermining their interests on Trump's whim to fuck everything Obama means these other countries have less of an interest in cooperating with the US again in the future.

A complet misinterpretation of events. Iran has the right, like any nation that signed the NPT, to have civilian nuclear program. They didn't want to devlop it themselfs and planned to buy it from France. The US objected and made sure France blocked the sale.

Then Iran started devloping its own program and the Israel/US threatend war against them to make them stop.

>It was hugely different when EU was on board, wasnt it?

Not really. The EU is mostly feckless and cannot provide for it's own security. It's also becoming weaker on the world stage and in six months is set to lose 20% of it's GDP overnight. The EU is largely irrelevant because every EU country would rather do business with a $20T economy than a $450B econo y (that's generous, too).

>The families of 9/11 victims will finally have their day in court, as a lawsuit filed Monday seeks to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for their role in the attacks, despite the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations’ all-too-cozy relationship with the Saudi government. The suit says that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA),

>*“raised, laundered and paid substantial financial support to al Qaeda to fund its budget and terrorist activities, including the preparation and execution of the September 11th Attacks [… and] actively supported al Qaeda in its final preparations for the September 11th Attacks through a network of the Kingdom’s officer, employees and/or agents who met with and aided the hijackers.”*

>New York local news outlet, PIX11 reported on the details of the suit, saying that Saudi officials supported two hijackers in the 18-months leading up to September 11, 2001:

>*“The officials allegedly helped them find apartments, learn English and obtain credit cards and cash. The documents state that the officials helped them learn how to blend into the American landscape.”*

>The suit even goes on to show that a Saudi official was in the same Virginia hotel with some of the hijackers the night before the attacks. The Saudis in power sought to fund and support the attacks in an attempt to gain support from religious fundamentalists in the kingdom, according to the lawsuit, using evidence from the FBI’s investigation into the 9/11 attacks.

>The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhatten by Kreindler & Kreindler, an aviation law firm, and lays out how Saudi royals funneled funds to Osama bin Laden through terrorist-friendly charities. Attorney Jim Kreindler told PIX11: “The charities were alter egos of the Saudi government.”

>The suit was recently made possible by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), which was passed in September of 2016. President Obama vetoed the bill only to see the Senate vote 97-1 to override the President’s authority and pass the bill anyway. In his veto, Obama said that the bill would “create complications in our relationships with even our closest partners.” Shamefully, the President was likely worried that we may upset one of our key petroleum and weapons trade partners.

>As the bill was being passed, DTN pointed to the economy as Obama’s reasoning behind his veto:

>*“Estimates put the figure of official Saudi assets in the government at somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion when considering potential foreign bank deposits and offshore accounts.*

>The kingdom had $96.5 billion in holdings of Treasury securities in August, according to the most recent number released by the Treasury Department. Saudi Arabia ranked 15th in its holdings of U.S. Treasury debt.”

>General Electric, Dow Chemical, Boeing, Chevron, as well as several firms hired directly by Saudi Arabia lobbied against the bill, putting business interests before justice.

>While the 9/11 families are battling Saudi Arabia in court, the Saudi government is now funding a devious PR campaign to dupe US veterans into protesting JASTA in Washington, DC. Ring of Fire reported on the dastardly plan earlier in March. Qorvis MSLGROUP, a PR firm operated by the Saudi Arabian government, has recruited veterans to travel to Washington, DC – paying for dinners, drinks, and a stay in the plush Trump International Hotel – in a ploy to have the veterans pressure Congress to gut JASTA. The veterans are falsely told that JASTA could open up individual American soldiers to lawsuits for their acts in military actions. “JASTA poses no risk of exposing U.S. service members to lawsuits in foreign courts. JASTA deals only with the immunity of foreign states, not individuals,” according to William S. Dodge, an international law expert and law professor at UC-Davis.

>The fight over JASTA and the lawsuit against the Saudi government risk upsetting an uncomfortably cozy relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia. The relationship was developed during the 1973 oil crisis and fostered under George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Bush sought to keep the oil flowing between the United States and Saudi Arabia, even after 9/11, while Obama sold over $115 billion in weapons to the kingdom during his administration.

>Hall of Fame Trial Lawyer and television and radio host Mike Papantonio says that it is shameful that the wishes of the Saudi government have been placed before the needs of the 9/11 victims:

>*“The love relationship between the Saudis and the US government has got to take a back seat in uncovering the truth about the Saudi involvement in the mass murder of 3,000 Americans on American soil. Both Bush and Obama have protected their Saudi pals for far too long.”*

>James Riches, a retired firefighter that lost his son in the attacks, echoed those sentiments in an interview with Pix11, “The Obama and Bush administrations have done nothing but fight the 9/11 families for 15 years. The United States government took the side of the Saudis over the 9/11 families.”

>Following in the footsteps of his predecessors, President Trump recently approved a multi-million dollar deal to send even more arms to the kingdom. The same deal was halted by President Obama last year, after more than 60 lawmakers from House of Representatives opposed the deal, citing human rights violations and possible war crimes committed by Saudi Arabia in their attacks against Yemini rebels. Trump had previously spoken out against the Saudi government for their role in 9/11, but it seems that oil and money have pushed aside his concerns.

>In addition to political hurdles, the victims’ families are gearing up for a long and arduous legal battle over the lawsuit. The firm bringing the suit says in a statement:

>*“The KSA will fight the case very hard.  We anticipate its lawyers will challenge JASTA on Constitutional grounds and will seek to dismiss the case alleging that there is not sufficient evidence that it bears responsibility for the 9/11 attacks. […] [W]e we must convince the court that the KSA provided material support to al Qaeda and we face a well-funded and determined foe.”*

You say it was a mistranslation but ask any Persian and they will tell you their president is a fucking mad man.

Should I here note while AIPAC and other Jewish lobbying groups are ""common knowledge"", which by no means of the proper definition (or my own understanding of the definition) of conspiracy does a group being known commonly exclude a group from being considered conspiratorial - if that's what the group is. Also, does this mean there are no Jewish groups not commonly known? Does this mean these not commonly known Jewish groups, if they exist, would not commit any conspiracies?

Further, what you're proposing is a defensive pact with the most verbally hostile nation against the US since the Cold War ended. This is not something that comes lightly... not even close to it.

So? We train and supply weaponry to israel. What's the big deal. Lots of countries train and supply weapons including israel.

Iran does not have nuclear weapons and they are not working on nuclear weapons.

Those groups could just as easily get a hold of chemical or biological weapons. In fact it would be easier than getting nukes.
