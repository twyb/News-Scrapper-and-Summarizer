27,"The problem is the alternative to getting tougher with China is to allow them to walk all over us.  When China joined the WTO back in 2001, they ""promised"" to move towards an open-market type economy with a level playing field between both domestic and foreign industries which is the entire point of the WTO.  Now, almost 20 years later, they have done little to fulfill those promises and in some cases have gone counter to the promises they made.  China still subsidizes their own companies (which in many cases is illegal according to WTO policy) and puts enormous barriers in the way to discourage foreign competition in their markets.  China has already had tariffs of up to 35% on almost all imported goods for decades.  Not to mention all the other shenanigans they pull off to cheat at international trade.  And what about the $300 billion + a year in Intellectual Property they steal from the US alone via coercion, forced transfer and straight up theft?

It's obvious China is not just going to do the right thing on its own.  There has to be consequences for the bad actions it takes and the constant backtracking on its own ""promises."".  Unfortunately, tariffs are the only economic weapon we have short of outright sanctions which would be even more disastrous.

3072,"> Trump is basically using the tool of the tariff, the countervailing duty, etc. to raise the cost of doing business for China.

Correct. 

Trump is - in essence - trying to make it so expensive to manufacturing things in China that companies are forced to move manufacturing back to America. 

How do you get around the fact that he has vastly, vastly under-estimated how much he would have to artificially raise costs for it to make financial sense for a company to move back? And in the event he successfully *does* raise prices enough to force manufacturing back - those raised prices will directly be placed against the American economy in the form of higher prices and threaten to diminish the very thing he's trying to capture? (Americans buying a lot of crap)

For example - Lets say rubber dodgeballs. 

* The rubber itself costs $0.05 cents per ball

* The labor in China costs $0.01 cent per ball. 

* The labor in America costs $0.10 cent per ball. 

* A company needs/wants 10,000 balls.

In this example, it would cost a company $600 to build them in China and ship them to America & would cost them $1,500 to build them in America. Even **IF** Trump managed to force costs high enough to make financial sense to move manufacturing back (a huge if - he hasn't even gotten close in most markets) ~ Who pays that extra $0.09 per ball?

Because a private interest gained a contract to build and fund those things.

> Usually in America's case, those interests have aligned with a peaceful, prosperous, capitalist world order, with a few ""broken eggs"" along the way.

As one of the many broken eggs of America's enduring commitment to keeping conflicts around the globe simmering - involved in more than 50 overt conflicts since 1945 and a lot more covert ones - I can assure you that you are simply defending exceptionalism and nationalism by shouting ""exceptionalism and nationalism"". Which advances no argument other than obedience works.

> I don't think there are any among our allies who view America's stance toward China as ""unfair"" 

Spot on. The only thing you say of any consequence: should anybody point out how unfair America is - in any matter - they become the enemy. That is the crux of the matter. America is Nationalist and Exceptionalist and brooks no critique of that position regardless of how well informed it might be.

> But even taking your appeal to fairness as some real framework for international relations, 

It is not merely my ""appeal to fairness"" it is a well known part of the Framework of the EU. The Treaty of Versailles and the failed Wilson Fourteen Points and the failed Dawes Plan - all pushed by American National Interest - resulted in the failure of the peace and the recommencement of European War in 1939. The European Union with its ""appeal to fairness"" has managed to keep European Peace for far longer and with far better outcomes for all involved.

Pretending it is all about economics is hiding behind the nonsense of wrapping up morality in numbers. NATO should be abolished: it has nothing to do with anything other than extending US Foreign Policy on a subsidised basis. Japan has very little in common with the US - the Post War Occupation has left the country subservient to the US,  thus leaving no cultural and economic force in the North of the Pacific to moderate China. Which means America is ""in charge"".

None of this NATO/ANZUS/Japan fantasising benefits anybody but the US. Which - as Vietnam, Korea, Iraq and so on, demonstrate: leads nowhere in the interest of anybody but the US.

So your proposal that we all just knuckle down to American National Interest is nonsense. America is in the minority - about 330m people out of 7.5Bn. Less than 1/15. Pretending that America is anything other than ""yet another country"" is simply the lazy way to perpetuate conflict.

You have no proof his goal is to eliminate access. Why is interstate health insurance competition a bad thing again?

And they get away with it by staying the course on one or two issues. Dems have the same problem.

3525,"> I don't know why you want to break up NATO other than some vague sense of anger at how your life has turned out

Way off the mark. I am simply acutely aware of the effective influence American Policy has had on my life. There is no vague sense of anger at all. 

> and the precedent of trust that allowed for the ECSC between France and Germany in the first place was provided by the force assurance of British-American occupation and then NATO

NATO contributes very little, if anything it is a subsidy for American Military Adventures. That is, however, a rather different subject. 

No, the American Occupation of Europe was only ever a matter of expedience. I support things I do not approve of out of expedience as does everyone else. The fact that you suppose the ""litany"" to be ""hackneyed slogans"" argues to the very core of my comment by supporting the argument that the American ""National Interest"" has been pushing the World into Wars for at least a century: the American National Interest is War.

The Occupation of Europe was not merely Germany. The UK continues to have American Airbases which should have left decades ago. Turkey, Eastern Europe - and all on the prospectus that ""American Occupation is better than Soviet Occupation"". You speak from the position of the Occupying Force which, in general, gets the better end of any such deal.

NATO has gone past its date of historical usefulness. Since Clinton, it has become, increasingly, a means for America to get extra bodies, materiel, logistics and so on for military Adventurism. Sarajevo is not that happy about being bombed - but there are always ""reasons"" and always ""collateral damage"". NATO could be easily replaced, within the Eurasian Continental Landmass, with a European Force. Based on trust and fairness rather than being ""The World's Policeman"".

The Forteen Points led to the debacle of Versailles which led to the Second World War via the Spanish Civil War and so forth. The whole of Europe is still paying off the debt from the First War: suggesting American National interest is merely Profit and the means War.

So, it is germane to the subject at hand. You fail to make the connection between the historical stability of American Foreign Policy as being ""War for Profit"" (a short slogan, guaranteed to get attention) and the current administration being headed by the most incompetent group of opportunists, cultists (odd word, but appropriate) and belligerents. That mixture along with the historically stable ""National Interest"" of America makes the world incredibly dangerous. Which is not particularly clever, economically, given the relationship between America (the Indebted nation) and China (the Creditor Nation) or Militarily given the need for America to demand ""support from allies"" to sustain an increasingly thin global presence. So it really is germane to the subject at hand.

Can America avoid damaging the global economy for the next few years while the incompetence of Trump plays out? If it cannot, then the ""vague sense of anger"" will be the least of America's worries. Policy has consequences. Which is *germane*. Policy leads to positive and negative outcomes. Which is *germane*. The Historical evidence is that American ""National Interest"" does not mesh well with poor Administrations. Nixon and Vietnam, for example.

The notion that ""force assurance of British-American occupation"" was anything other than ""force"" is really nothing more than a pretence that might is right and the American Way works. Yes, it does. It has limitations. It has exceeded those limitations and put an idiot into the Whitehouse. That has huge, enduring impact on Policy.

The OECD (Organisation for Economic *Cooperation* and Development - there is a clue about ""fairness"" in that name) is not a trivial commentator. It is warning that America is not actually privileged enough to destabilise the Global Economy.

You people fucking act like China picked your pocket. The trade deficit exists because you assholes are addicted to buying cheap shit from China. Every time you and family unit waddle into Walmart and buy something that would cost you three or four times as much if it were made in the US, you're benefiting from and contributing to the trade deficit.

As for dumping practices, Americans really need to take a hard look in the mirror before they ever shit talk China on that point:

However, the Democrats are not rallying behind any one candidate (although it is early), and it seems like they'll settle for the centrist, more bland candidate, similar to how Romney was considered and how Republicans settled for him in 2012.

Republicans were absolutely convinced that Obama, who in their minds was basically the worst person alive, could never win a second term. They were shocked and disgusted when Obama won again, even though it wasn't that surprising considering he was an incumbent and the vast majority of Democrats still supported him. 

Now, Democrats think Trump is the worst person alive and they think there's no way any rational person could vote for him again. But he's an incumbent, and probably 99.99% of Republicans will vote for him again. If the Democrats don't pick the right candidate that they will rally behind, Trump could certainly get reelected.

- U.S. policy has not recognized the PRC's sovereignty over Taiwan;

8288,"I mean, to start with even using the term ""nationalism"" would likely put you in quite some trouble in Soviet Union. Proper terminology called for 'patriotism': evil Nazis and bourgeois were nationalistic. What it meant varied with exact period of USSR's history, but basically the idea of Soviet patriotism viewed as Russian nationalism came with Stalin, and mostly died with Stalin. Even during Stalin reign the nationalistic tendencies were dialed down drastically post-WW2. Communist countries emphasized internationalism, and generally portrayed itself as alliance of people rather than nations (with obvious emphasis here on working class). Starting with mid-1970s with advent of shortages that completely died down though, and by the late 80s each republic had own nationalistic movement (and post-collapse nascent states, as well as those freed from Soviet influence, experienced massive wave of nationalist sentiment in 90s which by the way in many cases leads to current political climate). That's something directly opposite to what China is doing, which is creation of one nationalistic movement in what is still de facto multi-ethnic country.

As for outside threat, again there's a bit of subtleties you're completely missing. USA was never portrayed as enemy of Soviet Union. US imperialist elites were. People of USA, especially working class, were the opressed brainwashed ones living in terrible conditions on crime-ridden streets, with modern slavery and capitalism about to collapse in fires of revolution. Yes, failures in Soviet Union and its satellites were usually 'caused by imperialists agents' and so on. However, that's again completely different from clear ""WE (Chinese) versus THEM (Americans)"" mentality that pits two nations as a whole against each other in much more standard setting.

The only thing the US has going for it is that it's rich. Otherwise it would be a fucking shithole and its people would all suffer and everyone would consider it yet another crazy banana republic with a fucked-up militaristic government mistreating its people.  

Not to mention that the US is a corrupt oligarchy without any kind of accountability, neither internationally nor to its own people, yet its people believe to be free because that's what they were brainwashed to believe since childhood on. And they think their success as a nation was based on American freedoms, values and ingenuity... while in reality it's all based on theft, war, and unsustainable exploitation of the environment and people worldwide via capitalist economics. At least China recognizes that capitalism is garbage (even though, unfortunately, they are not employing it full force).

For example, to the extent that ARRA reduced long-term unemployment during the 2009–2011 period, it might improve participation in the labor force, employment, and productivity in later years. However, CBO’s estimates of the long-term effects of ARRA do not incorporate any effects of that sort.""*): instead, the report is just a measure of the immediate effect of ARRA on the US economy, not its cumulative impact, nor does it consider all indirect factors in evaluating its long term effects.

China is also trying to claim ownership of the South China Sea by building artificial islands and putting military bases on them, with nuclear bombers, in an apparent attempt to control the trade passing through the South China Sea, which is estimated to amount to around 5.3 Trillion.

We just caught one of our own military veterans attempting to give China classified military information.  We also caught an ex-CIA operative spying for China a month ago.

On **June 10th,** it was announced **China hacked and stole 600+ Gigabytes of Highly Sensitive** **US** **Naval Data**.

Which was also the same day an **unannounced, and unclaimed, missile** launched from the Whidbey Island area off the coast of Washington State, where there are **no known missile launch pads.**

President Trump arrived in Singapore around **8:20 pm** on **Sunday, June 10th**.  A flight from Seattle, WA to Singapore is around **16 hours.**   Given his arrival time, President Trump would have been flying over Washington State area in the vicinity of **4:00 am**, leaving from Quebec the night before.

The **unannounced, and unclaimed, missile** launch took place at **3:56 am** on **Sunday, June 10th.**

Naval Data stolen by China (6/10).

Missile Launch with no launch pads (6/10).

President in the air nearby (6/10).

Get it?

Why did Trump leave Singapore early?

Prove me wrong.

The Chinese won't care about the tariff, they'll just increase prices to account for the tariff. The consumer will pay the tariff on Chinese imports. Chinese imports will still be cheaper than anything American made. What now? Everyone in America is essentially paying taxes on anything that comes from China.

It would make sense if there were alternatives that could be bought... but there aren't. I have nothing against tariffs on China on principle. I have something against this utterly brain dead decision in the economical sense.

It also just increases world tension for no reason, in a time where US alliances are in shambles. If you want to make this tariff, you decide about it with your Allies and you impose it as a group in an attempt to get China to the table and broker a better deal. You don't do it at the same time you shunned your allies, so they'll in turn speak with China to broker better deals that cut you off. It's insane. 

Besides, what happens if this \*works\*. Is China just gonna starve or will they retaliate before? I for one would rather not have this escalate into a military war, but fuck if that ain't gonna happen before China falls too far. And if US-EU relations keep being this flimsy China might get ideas... And it wouldn't be that hard to mobilize people against the US. As this entire thread proves.

9843,"Yup.

Tarrifs ultimately just do one thing: they make things more expensive your your own countrymen.  

That CAN also make some extra jobs, but only if the increased prices don't destroy more.  

Steel gets more expensive, more local steel jobs are created(ideally).  However, all the manufacturing that uses steel also sees an increase in steel pricing, and this pushes up the price of their products, or even ruins them if margins are thin.  I'm in manufacturing, though with plastics.  A 20% increase in the cost of raw materials (the raw material cost being the single largest expense) would cause massive layoffs, as several products we make would no longer be profitable.  Our prices would shoot up, and because we make packaging, that would then increase the cost of everything that's packaged.

Jobs lost all along the line, and end prices for consumers pushed up severely.

Tarrifs are almost never a good thing, imho.

When America abandoned the gold standard, most of the world still basically decided to keep their currencies pegged to the dollar. The dollar *itself* isnthe standard. This is why countries have *dollar reserves* to safeguard their economies. Even Russia does, and it tapped heavily into it back in 14/15.

Globalist economies aren't some simple zero sum game where one nation's loss automatically benefits another. The economies and currencies are too heavily intertwined in an enormous and complex network, and the worldwide trust in the dollar is basically the pin that holds this all together.

Those outlets have served almost no informational purpose and instead seem to focus on riling up the base. Perhaps worst of all, they make their audience feel informed on the issues while simultaneously instilling a sense of superiority. Their target audience feels more knowledgeable about issues when some studies have shown that they are actually more poorly informed [ see [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/study-watching-fox-news-makes-you-less-informed-than-watching-no-news-at-all-2012-5)].

My father, who is an otherwise rational man in every way, has been a Rush Limbaugh fan (dittohead) for as long as I can remember. When I began breaking away from ""conservatism/Republicanism/libertarianism"", our relationship hit some very rocky points. Recently, he's made an effort to avoid politics and ""just enjoy life"". The change has been very noticeable. While he still considers himself a Republican/Conservative, he is much more open to discussion. 

I myself began changing my viewpoint when I stopped listening to guys like Rush Limbaugh, Neal Boortz, and similar in my drive time. I had been indoctrinated for the longest time with the idea that NPR was just liberal lies. But when I actually listened to it, I found that the reporting was fairly balanced, ethical, and much more substantive than *any* of the AM talk shows. So, I listened more. And coincidentally, right around the same time, I also started taking a Critical Thinking class in college. Blew my mind. Completely changed the way I looked at news, arguments, and opinions. Then, right at the point of ""coming out of the closet"" as no longer being a Republican, the financial collapse happened and Barack Obama was elected in 2008 (I didn't vote for him then). I watched the GOP response to his election and Presidency of the next four years and was absolutely disgusted. It was so transparently political and rife with lies and intentional mischaracterizations. The Birther shit *really* got to me. They had completely exposed themselves for what they were and instead of being just ""no longer a Republican"", I became ""anti-Republican"". And I'll remain so until this permutation of the Republican party ceases to exist. Unfortunately, it seems to have only gotten significantly worse. Trumpism is a fucking nightmare.

But anyways, similarities:

- Hitler's Lügenpresse (lit. ""Lying press"") is very similar to Trump's ""fake news"". 
- Hitler's propagandist Goebbels used similar tactics as Fox News (I'm aware he doesn't control Fox, but he does speak to Hannity almost daily. Plus he doesn't need to control them for them to be effective propagandists). 
-Rose to power on a populist platform against the ruling elite and fear of minorities (Immigrants, Cartels). 
-Recent acts of arrest and placement in concentration camps of young children in violation of constitutional rights. 
-Ran on a narrative that America was downtrodden due to global efforts, promising a return to old glory and Isolationism. 
-Militarily inclined (First use of MOAB, missile strikes not approved by congress, appointment of John Bolton). 
-Blatant disregard for minorities (Puerto Rico still without power, potentially 1500 dead)
-Blatant disregard for rule of law

Even if he did commit crimes, would we remove that President? That's probably largely up the largely Republican Congress which, as we all know, are mostly completely beholden to the President and deadset on subverting voting rights, diminishing human rights, or doing anything that secures them a stranglehold that can withstand a potential backlash via democracy. 

I'm not some legal scholar or anything but everything I've seen suggests Congress would not remove Trump (doesnt take a scholar to see that by now), he might not be tried even if Mueller finds things, and even if Mueller's team found things and Trump actually pardoned himself like he's suggested, there's not much in the way of what should be done if a President pardons themselves. 

I've read people who suggest the punishment for pardoning yourself as President would be impeachment, in which case we are, again, all screwed and stuck with a criminal President because that's up to Congress. It would be up to Congressional Republicans (because they hold the majority in the house and Senate right now) to hold principle before party. They have literally no principles so nothing will happen. They're Constitutionalists who care about equality under the law in the same way Trump's massive, unprecedented evangelical base cares about human decency and their fellow man.

Again, this is all assuming Mueller doesnt get axed which doesnt seem at all unlikely, especially some time after November. If you even vaguely care about living in something that resembles a democracy or even a first-world country its basically become your responsibility to, at the very least, go to the polls for everything from President, to Senator, to governor, to DA and make Republicans, voters and politicians, completely politically impotent. It would help to study up on voter disenfranchisement and fight back there too. There's maybe discussions that can be had with the Democratic party, and where some conversations fail there are political fights to be had, but to pretend there's an even remotely equal or even cosmetically equal mirror image in what Republicans have come to represent (and its only getting worse) is totally laughable.

12032,"As someone living in China and of Chinese descent, your perspective is probably wrong.

The amount of manufacturing in China doesn't just suddenly shift. The infrastructure, logistics, and manpower do not appear overnight.

Look at 义乌 and how much absolute junk gets manufactured out there. Think about the investment it takes to produce even 1% of this junk and how risky that is. Or look at the massive amount of electronics coming out of 华强北， it isn't called the Silicon Valley of Hardware for no reason.

People like to imagine there are other countries that can just take over this manufacturing, but it's not only risky, it takes time, infrastructure, and a lot of investment.

China is insane with the amount of power it generates even at it invests heavily into more expensive renewable sources. Some of the option countries in Indochina just do not have the infrastructure in place to support these high energy consumption processes.

Another example is to look at Foxconn. They employ thousands of engineers per factory. Then take a look at the Foxconn deal happening in the US and you shouldn't even be surprised that they now have to import workers from outside of the country. Most countries don't have the workforce numbers let alone a specialized workforce.

Tariffs went up and the trade deficit between the US and China got higher. Think about why that is. There is just too much crap made in China that is so cheap that nobody else wanted to invest in manufacturing to compete. Now even with the tariffs, China has no competitors for a lot of these goods.

You should also be well aware that boycotting in China is on an entirely different level than most other countries. The previous Japanese protests, the recent Korean one. My friend got yelled at by a store clerk for buying an iPhone a few months ago because of this trade war. This type of thing would never happen in the US on any scale remotely close.

Also, as someone who buys products in China and sells them in the US, this trade war did nothing to my business. All of my products already sell at 200-400% ROI. At most this will thin out the shitty sellers who sell on shit margins, at the very least it will just mean everybody raises their prices.

When are businesses going to eat into profits to help economies and the people that made them?

To give an example, I'm on assisted living. Trump signed something that unsubsidized housing. Now our housing complex is charging the extra money they aren't getting in subsidized income. They are passing it off to the people. They don't have to do this, they choose too. When confronted about this, the Rep waffled and basically said it's a business, we make money.

When are the people going to hold companies accountable? Trump is just a tide. It came in, but it will eventually go out. Yet, people are acting like this is a permanent problem.

Businesses are just using this shit as an excuse not to cut into profits and that's all. And I'm tired of it.

Trump has the worst record of factual statements of any president since they've been tracking it.

If a foreign company wants to do business in China, they have to agree to share technology secrets with the government.

14975,"Could be argued that the populations of the two countries won't get the money at all - only indirectly via things the respective Governments decide to spend it on.

Tariffs on imported products need to be paid by the importer, who would then pass it on through the supply chain to the retailers, and then ultimately to the consumers.

Basically, everything with a tariff on it would get more expensive, and logically it might mean that the sales of these now more-expensive goods will go down. Revenues will be recouped in part by the higher price-per-item, but usually it will end up in a decrease in overall revenue.  

I mean, in a trade war when a whole bunch of different items become more expensive, people will make decisions and start asking themselves whether they really need that item.

This trade war is going into raw materials though - steel, for example. That means *everything* that currently uses imported steel gets more expensive. From whitegoods to cars to houses.

Lots of things getting more expensive means people will buy fewer items overall - you still only have the same pool of money. The Government isn't going to use that tariff money to lower your income tax, for example. So you'll buy less things, or you'll go out to eat less. Which means some retailers, or cafes, will see less custom, and less cashflow. Which means they might have to reduce the hours of some employees, or let some people go. 

*Those* people now have less money, so *they* buy less things.

It's a very fine line to walk when controlling the amount of money sloshing around an economy. Push it too far, and people get scared and start stockpiling instead of spending, and when people stop spending, well, see 1929.",-0.021166415284062344,negative,US/China Trade War,0.4894167923579688,negative

In fact for whatever reason, China was in fact stubbornly resistant to the 
private diplomatic exhortations by Bush officials at the time  to ""free up your financial markets"" like Bush had been doing domestically.

So china entered the crisis in an entirely different position. It was running a budget surplus and had been raising interest rates to tamp down excessive growth. Its banks had been reining in consumer spending and excessive credit. So when the crisis hit, the Chinese government was already positioned to engage in standard policies to lower interest rates, raise government spending, ease up on credit, and encourage consumers to start spending.

They can probably weather an economic downturn for a little while without any real effect at all on social stability, whereas if China countered with tariffs on some key US constituencies, like the soy tariff targeted at Trump voting farmers, even a minor downturn will make people lose their minds and threaten to vote out congress.

On the other hand, in a sustained trade war, yes American people will lose their minds and vote in another congress, but that's about it.  Society won't collapse, government won't collapse, voting out congress is democracy working as intended and it's normal.  But in a sustained, major downturn for China, people can't vote out anyone.  If they start getting hungry, if they start to have genuine fear they are going back to the bad old days of the 70s and before, they will actually lose their minds.  Poor people will take to the streets, violently.  Rich people will sell off their assets inside China and move everything to a first world democracy.  Chinese society will actually collapse, unless the military can be counted upon to carry out multiple Tiananmen Square massacres to maintain control.  And it's been a while since the PLA has carried out a large scale domestic massacre, let alone multiple.  Nearly 30 years now.  So I wouldn't be 100% confident they will do it if I was Xi.

Frankly, I think Xi is talking tough but he knows deep down that in a real sustained trade war, or a real sustained shooting war, China will collapse long before America.  American politicians will lose their jobs in a minor trade war, so of course they will do everything they can to avoid that, and that's why Xi thinks he can afford to talk a little tough, but in a real, long trade war, the CCP is in serious danger of losing everything they have, even their lives, if they don't flee the country in time, Chinese society will either break down or revert to the hellish conditions of Mao's reign, and American society will trundle along as it always has and if really necessary will replace Chinese manufacturing with some other poor third world labor market; though automation will continue to pick up the majority of the slack there anyway, which will doom China in the long run either way.",-0.015042921930677034,negative,US/China Trade War,0.4924785390346615,negative

Kinda, but not exactly. That 500 billion changes hands more than once but GDP inst the sum of ""money changing hands"", but of value added. So it is a fair comparison.

BUT, a trade war can have a greater impact in other ways. Let's say a Chinese company has 20 million dollars of total output and sells half its output to the US which is 10 million dollars. If that company collapses due to a trade dispute, the loss tot he economy would be 20 million. Also, such collapses will cause a cascade of failures and eventually the baking system will fail and the loss would be a lot more than 500 billion. China is especially vulnerable because the Balance Sheets of its banks are riddled with bad loans. And I have not even got into the shadow banking system yet.

 The reason the banking system hasn't already failed is because of state support. But the state's pocket are not infinitely deep. China can't frivolously spend its foreign currency reserves to bail out companies because those dollars are needed to make its currency stable and support China's sovereign rating and oil/ commodity imports. China already got downgraded once in 2017 and each downgrade makes servicing debt harder and harder. 

Also, keep in mind that the bigger they are, the harder they fall. The US can allow a bank or two to fail. But China has just a few very very large banks and if one of them fails, it can cause a catastrophic chain reaction. 

China has been cracking down hard on its banking system to curb the excesses and restricting capital flight to foreign destinations. How much success they are having is anybody's guess since they choose what data to give out. But they have admitted the problem exists themselves (which is a good sign I guess).

There are a few other counter arguements below on the other stuff you typed out. I just have something to add in regards to the IP theft. This is done by the way of 'strategic alliance' with another Chinese partner. However, if one doesn't like the forced alliance, one has the option not to go ahead with it. 

From the Chinese perspective, they do not just want to be cheap labour for the world. They want to be leaders in manufacturing. Also, another notion I keep hearing is that the China is where it is because they've stolen IP. China has also invested heavily into education over the past couple of decades. There is definite innovation coming out of China as a result of this investment.

Keep in mind America imports \*a lot\* of agricultural goods.  Our chickens, for example, are processed in China.  Lots of fish comes from China.  As a vegan, I may enjoy lower prices on soy due to less demand from oversea markets.  However, if Chile, Venezuela, Mexico, etc all band together and decide to unilaterally stop selling to America out of retaliation (or due to trade pacts formed with other countries like China, the EU, Russia, etc), and as climate change causes droughts and spoils crops, America will start to wish they had opened trade markets with countries that can still grow food.  Think California avacados, almonds, etc and Florida oranges etc which in recent years have been hit hard by the changing climate.  And the last three years have consistently set hottest-temperature records.

Yes, years of subsidies for monoculture crops have encouraged depletion of our agricultural heritage.  IF all subsidies across the board go away, we can return to sustainable farming -- this is not happening any time soon.  The dairy industry, for example, has been price-locked for decades so politicians can point to the CPI and say everything is fine. Meanwhile, small farmers across the country are going out of business because only unsustainable factory farmers can get the production quantities necessary to earn the subsidies and remain competitive.

The real blow to US in a trade war with China is China stop using the fiat US Dollar and start dumping it. Because they'll have no use for it. China can easily make deals with other Countries to trade in their own currency (already did with Russia). why would China continue to use a Fiat US dollar, not worth the paper its printed on, if there's a trade war with the US. 

And here lays the REAL Reason US pivot to China, trying to Contain China, using lapdogs and proxies to drum up tension and conflict with China, and funding/sponsoring failed annoying riots in Hong Kong. US want to block China's Trade route in case of a full on trade war where China stop using the US fiat Dollar.

16565,"Except that under the current leadership of China, an uprising really isn't a likely outcome, not over the trade war anyway. People in China see this as Trump's trade war, not China's, so the blame won't land on Xi Jinping for responding to economic attacks on China from the US. He will simply project strength and resolve and the population will weather the storm together. 

An uprising in America as people's already stagnant standard of living gets reduced is much more likely than one from a growing China who's population is still generally used to shitty living conditions, especially given how politically divided America is. The same political divisiveness doesn't exist/can't be targeted in China due to there only being one party, so all China needs to do is run down the clock until the midterms and they'll help force a government into place in the US who will be more open to rational discussion than the current administration. There's no real reason for them to entertain Trump's craziness at all when they know Trump is playing 100% from a position of weakness. Xi Jinping will outlast him and won't be willing to be seen as weak on trade. Given that Trump threw the first stone, and that most of the products China has placed tariffs on in response can be sourced from other countries instead of the US, there's little downside risk for China to just keep matching Trump's tariffs. Each volley from Trump hurts the US twice, while each return volley China makes really only hurts them once. 

IMO the idea that America is ripe for revolution is at least partially supported by the [J Curve Theory of Revolutions](http://www.popularsocialscience.com/2013/04/17/james-c-davies-j-curve-theory-of-revolutions/), where over the past few decades America's growth from the perspective of the working class has come up short of the expectations they'd developed and been told to have. Or to quote that link, ""prosperity raises expectations, and depression frustrates people"". China's progress over the past half century has been tremendous, but America's gap between where it should/could be and where it is within that same timeframe has grown considerably, and the generally universal resentment of the current state of our government and apathy toward it is eerily similar to the USSR in the 80s before its dissolution. They entered an era of stagnation and floundering and people just stopped caring about the whole charade and began actively resisting it. I think that's what we're seeing in the US now, which makes the trade war a terrible decision for Trump and a painful one for the country. It will have blowback.

It does not include several large areas of an economy that arent measurable through monetary means. Things like Capital, labor, labor mobility, patents, technological patents, primary resources, infrastructure, natural resources, government, social organization, Trade agreements, GOODWILL. None of which can be measured by GDP. GDP only measures things for which money was exchanged.  I know that China is roughly half of USA's GDP stop posting it.

Nah again, pointing out that if you stuidied history, you'd know this is how it works usually. 
In addition you could even argue that looking at the amount of innovation comming from China now, out restrictive IP Laws are stiffling innovation and creativity.

> no, the people that ""invested"" in china were not signing up for systemic IP theft

Yes they were! You could argue that companies who _didn't_ invest in China and were spied on, didn't sign up. But literally _every_fucking_one_company_ that invested in China knew they do not respect IP Western Laws (why should they, it's our laws, not theirs!).
They walked into China fully knowing that the same laws indeed do not apply. They were either greedy, or stupid - thinking those *racial slur* are to stupid to understand it anyway, this btw. seems to be your atitude still to, you think all their recent innovations, surprasing west in areas liek solar panels production, must have been theft.

Face the music - China caught up to west, and thanks to set of laws that supports creativity and innovation surprased it.

Would you rethink what you think of “being/acting morally” means? Take this mental thought journey with me.

Think about it, China was always deplorable - it’s always been abhorrent to its average citizens essentially since its long existence of the Middle Kingdom.

But why is this coming up in the media now? Why are these tariffs coming up now? Is it because the US plutocrats lost their bet with the devil (China), where their knock off technology is competing and even dominating world markets (ex. Huawei)? Think about it for a second, what is Trump’s/the US’s goal with the trade war on China???

Oh, they’re mad because the US plutocrats are crying now that they’re getting clobbered by the Chinese company’s that “stole” their technology that was essentially openly handed over to the Chinese by the plutocrats/US multinationals for a couple decades of billions in profits in the hands of the few... all so they could abandon the American middle class for slave labour?

So, wait, what happens if China capitulates to this trade war and gives in? What would this mean? I know what it means, it means the US plutocrats can continue to hallow out the American middle class by sending over more jobs to China without the threat of IP theft... how does that help the average American that’s fallen for this fake argument about China. This stance by the US has nothing to do with the Muslim’s in China... this all has to do with maintaining the hegemonic power of the US plutocrats... I’ll say it again, this is all coming up to maintain the US plutocrats export of jobs to slave labour in China. 

Is that moral? The average American is being duped by US patriotic propaganda designed to support the very plutocrats who abandoned them in the first place... who created so much resentment that has led us electing a criminal president. This is why China is blowing up in the media across the US... give me a break the US really cares about Chinese Muslims... the administration openly hates Muslims and are essentially running concentration camps on the southern border.

Lowell’s baggage was subject to several intensive searches, for his captors had been warned that he may have stolen designs for power textile weaving machinery, a serious crime in England. Lowell, indeed, had done just that — but, aware of the risk, had committed the designs to memory....

Huzzah.  My point is that the divide is not because wealthy people, it's because of poor people.  It's because poor people now have access to the worldwide market place and they're out-competing the middle class in America because they can offer far lower pricing on labor.

If we discover a massive vein of gold somewhere, and we double the amount of gold in the world overnight, would you or would you not expect the *price* of gold to drop?

Similarly, we now have access to a MUCH larger labor pool, meaning that *labor* has increased in supply.  The natural result is that the cost of labor will drop.  The only way to prevent that is to artificially jack up the price of foreign labor (tariffs).  However, this results in higher prices for people, those you call countrymen and neighbors.  

> I don't want to do harm to anyone living somewhere else, but the responsibility of my elected leaders is to first and foremost look out for the interests of people here.

>  Going to other locations means they're getting hit with the tariffs.

I disagree, a 20% loss in a matter of 8 months is very abrupt.  None the less, I dont see any reference to a numeric value being associated with the proper use of plummeted as you said.  50% right?  where does your definition mention that?

>Do you measure how much gas is in your tank by checking the charge on your phone?

This might be the must absurd thing I have seen in quite sometime.  What do you mean china is still exporting so tariffs arent working?  Tariffs have always existed for both the US and China yet each country continues to export goods.  Seriously, that was dumb of you to even throw out there.

>How about the definition of a tariff?:

>A tariff is a tax on imports or exports between sovereign states.

>Where in that definition does it say stock? Nowhere, because tariffs target exports/imports, not stocks. So why are you measuring the effects of tariffs on stocks not exports?

cause the plummeting Chinese stock market is a result of the tariffs implemented by trump therefore I chose to talk about the negative effect the tariffs had had on china.  Why do you continue to argue Im not allowed to discuss this?

>Tariffs are a means used to effect economies by artificially inflating the price of exports, you're using the fluctuations of the stock market in an attempt to say the tariffs are working when in reality the tariffs aren't targeting stocks at all; the fluctuations are an effect, not the intended purpose. The intended purpose is to make imports from China more expensive and artificially drive demand for domestic contemporaries.

Im pointing out the effect the tariffs have had on Chinas stock market.  That is exactly what I am talking about here.  Why do you continue to infer that I can only talk about the economy and must ignore the impact the tariffs have had on Chinas stock market?

>Because the tariffs aren't targeting stocks, they're targeting exports; you're using an unrelated metric to try to claim tariffs are working. How are you claiming that's the intended effect when tariffs have nothing to do with stocks?

The Chinese stock market is down over 20% and this is directly due to the tariffs placed on china.  Companies that export goods to the US are more than likely publicly traded and therefor offer stock to investors.  These margins on their exports have diminished due to the tariffs and there for the ROI on the stock as well.  This is why Chinas stock market has plummeted over 20%.

>I never said you can't, I said the stock market is not the economy;
so when you say a fluctuation that's related to them is proof positive that they're working without measuring what the tariffs actually target (exports), then you're drawing a conclusion based on unrelated metrics.

No, Im stating a fact that China stock market has plummeted over 20% due to tariffs.  That is a direct relation.

>No shit. You've only mentioned stocks, which is why I've said they aren't the economy; 

I never said anything about the economy.  I percisely pointed out the FACT the chinese stock market has plummeted over 20% due to the tariffs.

>you want to measure the effect of the tariffs? Measure the change in exports and PPP before and after, not the fluctuations of the stock market.

>Congratulations, you found an article that used the same word as you, that does not mean the tariffs are working.

Lulz!!!  you asked for one and I provided you 2 articles that used the reference of plummeting in regards to the stock market.  Deal with it.

 >In fact that entire first article proves my point, despite being the Epoch Times; it mentions how investors are worried, it doesn't mention the effect the tariffs have on exports (what they're actually targeting) apart from the amount of trade between the two countries. So again, why are you trying to measure the effects of the tariffs using an unrelated metric?

How is it an unrelated metric?   The chinese stock market has plummeted 20% due to tariffs. 

>As I've said multiple times now, China can stand to devalue the yuan with little to no ill effect, whereas the US is dependent on a strong dollar. Add to that the possibility of restricted growth from retaliatory tariffs, lost market share due to lower production costs in China, and increased inflation, and you should begin to realize that these tariffs aren't working like they were intended to and might cause us just as much harm as they do China.

What does any of that have to do with the fact the chinese stock market has plummeted 20% due to the tariffs?  

>Uh, no, I didn't. Re-read these comments, because you're obviously misunderstanding. I said stocks fluctuate, but the fact that they're fluctuating now doesn't mean the tariffs are working because stocks aren't what tariffs target.

NO, you said stock dropping due to tariffs is what they are suppose to do.

>I didn't say you can't point them out as effects of the tariffs, I said they aren't evidence that they are working; 

But the the market has plummeted 20% due to the tariffs.  Thats exactly what I stated and that is the truth.

>no more than US stocks ""plummeting"" is evidence that counter tariffs are working. Stocks are a measure of investor confidence, not tariff efficacy.

The US stock market hasnt plummeted at all similar to the Chinese market.  So, see the adverse effects of the tariffs on each market?  Chinas has PLUMMETED over 20% and the US is only off less than 1%.  Big difference right.  

>you can, but that's not how the efficacy of tariffs is measured.

but it still has casued the Chinese market to plummet 20%.  

>I never said you couldn't, I said it's an unrelated metric that fluctuates regardless of tariffs;

NO, you keep trying to ignore the fact the chinese market has plummeted 20% due to the tariffs.  


 tariffs will have an effect, everything does, but it's neither the point nor intended effect of the tariffs, reducing exports is.

Yes, and the effect so far has led to chinas market plummeting 20%.  

>Exactly my point. Tariffs are levied to effect the economy via exports, not stocks;

A companies stock is a fractional ownership of the company.  Its value is determined by the estimated value of the overall company.  If a company's perceived value diminishes so does its stock value.  The chinese market PLUMMETING 20% is a result of the perceived value of all these companies losing that value due to the tariffs that is cutting into the profit margins of exported goods.  
 
 so again, why are you measuring the efficacy of tariffs by their effects on stocks?

Im not. I specifically pointed out the effects the tariffs have had on the stock market.

>I didn't say you can't, I said the stock market isn't the economy.

I never said it was.  seriously, youre arguing with yourself at this point.

China will never accept a reunification of Korea under a pro-US government. So even if war breaks out and we destroy North Korea, the Chinese will get involved and push everyone back to the current border just like they did in the first Korean War, and then install another pro-China government.

Instead, the Chinese should demand that Kim Jong Un steps down from power while guaranteeing him immunity and asylum in China. And if he was smart he'll take it. Then the Chinese can install a new pro-China government in NK that agrees to stop the nuclear program and that hopefully is better for the people, all without a shot fired. 

And if Kim Jong Un doesn't take the deal, then he's an idiot and I guess war would be the only way then. But at least we would have tried. If war does break out we should guarantee China that we will hand over NK back to them after we destroy the regime, so as not to provoke them further and hopefully avoid heavy Chinese involvement in the war.

No. India has a faster **rate** of growth than China (or it did briefly at one point recently), but it's economic growth in nominal terms is much slower than China, since the base from which it is growing from is magnitudes smaller. 

The fact is that at present, China's economy **grows** by the same amount as India's **ENTIRE** economy every 3-4 years. You can check this with 2017 figures.

21879,"""Not a great analogy because China would hurt to but no where near as bad as we would, they may say go head do it""

No China would hurt A LOT more. The balance of trade alone shows that China would be devastated. Looking at the number of jobs China gets from US manufacturing it's in the millions and hundreds of billions of their economy. 

If the US stops buying Chinese products you know how comes in and replaces the millions of unemployed? No one. You know where companies go to get their goods being made? MANY other countries. It would take a while, but you would have within months factories being used in South East Asia, Africa, South America. Mexico would have factories spring up. IN the US ones with automation would grow. 

China is a major producer of easily to manufactured goods that require little skill or expertise. With much of the technology being provided by foreign countries. 

Once companies start opening up these manufacturing in other countries you know what will happen? Other's will follow. Furthermore by siding with N. Korea China will have S. Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and most of Asia start looking elsewhere. Afterall China would rather protect a dictator who threatens to nuke it's neighbors over suffering one of the biggest economic disasters in their history. That would be utterly insane for them. Worst than invading Russia during winter.

The US would suffer, no doubt about that. It would be maybe years. China would be a long time in making up the demand. 

China's major trade partners:

USA, Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan.

When it comes to a trade war what do you think is going to happen. These countries going to join the US, which protects them and is their major trade partner, or China and N. Korea who talks about nuking them.

It might not be sudden, but if it started you would notice these countries moving trade away from China. Especially after N. Korea continues with talk of nuking the entire world.

But whatever. Say the 5.7 million IS part of the number. That actually makes the percentage go up to 61.2%...


Now, the way you worded your initial comment makes things tricky.

If this is the case, you are completely correct as you've pointed out. I won't and didn't argue with you there. But you said ""If you think even 1% of American's low wages..."" which, if you ignore the grammar, denotes 1% *of the low wages of America.* Which would imply 1% of the people who receive low wages, which is what I calculated.

If the UK does reach a withdrawal agreement and this is ratified, it moves into a transition, at least until the end of 2020, in which the status quo continues to apply.

- either China and America continue to yell at each other and place the blame on one another until America gears up for military action

- or the bickering continues until North Korea crosses a red line 

This typically doesn't end well when one power tries to run when it hasn't fully learned to walk yet.

23642,">South Korea should have done more over the years too.      
     
    
South Korea was under a dictatorship for decades which had a devastating effect on their economy - in fact because of Soviet support, North Korea's economy was actually far better for a time.  But then the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia stopped sending aid to North Korea, which forced the latter to put their policy of *[juche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche)* into overdrive.  Sadly, North Korea chose to spend their money on building a war machine that was rife with obsolete (or even fake) garbage instead of mitigating the effects of the crippling drought and famine that struck them.        
          
South Korea's prosperity didn't really come about until the early 90's after the establishment of the ""Sixth Republic"" in 1987, but then there was the financial crisis that struck Asia in the late 90s where the IMF had to bail them out.  Then there's the fact that South Korea's credit is always going to be terrible because of their state of war with North Korea, regardless of their armistice.      
     
     
And South Korea doesn't really have much in the way of natural resources - they were the seventh largest importer of goods in the world a few years ago.      
    
    
And it was never simple for South Korea to adopt a ""softer"" attitude since North Korea hasn't always made that easy.  North Korea attempted to have all of the Communist states boycott the '88 Seoul Olympics but that failed, so North Korea bombed a Korea Air Lines flight in '87 to teach the South a lesson.  Then there was the attempted assassination of a South Korean president in the early 80's by North Korea.     
     
   
South and North Korea did attempt to reconcile in the early 90s but that fell apart when South Korea stated that they had a problem with the North's nuclear weapon program, and the North basically told them to fuck off.      
      
    
I'm rambling now, sorry.  Just wanted to say that there's only so much South Korea could have done, but North Korea seemingly refuses to meet South Korea on ***anything***.

23645,"> China actually can but they won't do anything so the US has to do something. The guy is out of control

China is stuck between a rock and a hard place.  On one hand, China wants North Korea to serve as a buffer between themselves and the South, which is obviously dominated by US policies.  But on the other, North Korean leadership is prone to a lot of weird shitdickery which is causing Chinese leadership a lot of headaches.  China stopped buying North Korean coal and are in fact beefing up their military presence along their Korean border.
