1) Add system to the plane that is inherently dangerous (acts aggressively based on a single sensor, doesn't obviously notify when it's activated, no counteracting inputs disable it like extremely low altitude or rapid altitude loss or repeated, deliberate countering inputs from the pilots.)
2) Don't train pilots how to disable the system
3) Don't even tell pilots the system exists
4) Charge premium for even the most basic indicator lights of the system.

297,"I’m not at all saying that Boeing didn’t screw this up bad, but there is an important detail I often see left out. 

There is a known failure condition in aircraft called a runaway trim. This is not unique to the 737 or even Boeing, but it’s caused by a malfunction of the elevator trim causing it to become stuck to its maximum (or minimum) tilt. Because of this, the trim can be disabled. This failure condition is not new and is not known to be problematic. Pilots should be trained to recognize this and disable the system.

Boeing implemented their pitch control system with the MAX, and the failure condition of the system was considered. Because the symptoms of a failure is very similar to that of a runaway trim, the pitch control system was designed to be disabled the same way as the elevator trim. Boeing therefore didn’t tell pilots this because the pilot could theoretically notice the failure, think it was a runaway trim, and disable the trim, which would also disable the pitch control and fix the problem. In hindsight, this was a bad idea, but I can see why they did it in the first place. 

Despite this, in both crashes, the pilots did not disable the pitch control system. They did not recognize the failure as a symptom of runaway trim, and did not attempt to disable the corresponding system.  It seems they were lacking training they needed for a standard 737, let along the 737 Max. 

Another thing worth noting is that in both cases, the pilots were not physically able to overcome the pitch control system with their manual inputs. The motored were stronger than the pilots. This can’t happen, however, with an autopilot system because while the motors may be stronger, the physical connection between the autopilot and the control surfaces is designed to be a weak link. If the pilot pulls the stick too hard against the autopilot, the link will break and the pilot will have full control of the plane. This should have also been implemented on the pitch controls. That way, even without disabling the system, the pilots would have retained control of the system.

333,"This is not really true.  MCAS is NOT an anti-stall system.  It's a standard negative pitch system.

A stall is essentially the most catastrophic event any aircraft can occur.  It would be much better for a plane to lose its engines mid-flight then to experience a stall.  If an airplane loses its engines, it can still glide to the ground (where it can land is not often ideal: the Hudson river, some open field etc...).  But a stall is much worse.  A stall is when the plane loses all of its horizontal momentum.  So it begins to fall from the sky.  The thing about a stall is that in-order to regain control, the airplane essentially need's to take off again, while falling, without a runway, and while experiences a multitude of horrible counter forces.  It is extremely hard for a fighter jet to recover from a stall, let alone a fully loaded commercial airliner.

Most commercial airplanes have a negative pitch.  This negative pitch gives the plane a tendency to always lean up, rather than an inverted pitch, which would give the tendency to lean down.  A tendency to pitch up is better for a few reasons: (1) it can make the plan more fuel efficient because the plane never has to re-gain cruising altitude if it were to pitch down, (2) it can make the plain more fuel efficient because it will min. the amount of drag that causes the plane to expend more fuel to maintain the same altitude, (3) it can make the ride smoother for passengers, and (4) it is much less dangerous to pitch the nose-down a little than to pitch the nose-up (which can then cause a stall, or stall-like problems).

MCAS is a standard anti-pitch software, which like a ton of other software, runs on the plane to optimize the cost-effectiveness for airlines.  Yes, it caused these two crashes.  BUT it was NOT some band-aid fix to a doomed engineering design problem.

That's completely wrong. The Ethiopian investigation report clearly showed that the pilots followed the runaway trim checklist. 


They did disable MCAS using the stabilizer trim cutout switches, but the aircraft was trimmed nose down when they did so. Aerodynamic loading prevented manual trimming using the trim wheels. They eventually turned electric trim back on, as they didn't really have any other options, but didn't trim back enough, and left it turned on. At this point the right airspeed indicator (which should be more reliable) reads 365 knots. VMO is 340, so they're already in big trouble. 5 seconds later, MCAS kicked back in, and then it was all over.

 - It didn't behave like traditional runaway or how their training for runaway was conducted (it was neither trim slip nor hard runaway).    
 - ""They were slow to recognize trim runaway and **disabled it late**."" Note this is a MCAS specific criticism. With traditional hard runaway the trim wheel spins violently and the aircraft responds equally as dramatically. In an MCAS failure there is a 5 second delay after input before an e-trim command is executed, the trim change isn't as dramatic, so ""disabling it late"" is code for ""not understanding how MCAS works, a system they received no training on.""     
 - ""At this point the aircraft was flyable."" misleading. It wasn't **landable** in that configuration and they were pulling back hard on the yoke to counter-act MCAS's previous trim commands, it was unstable/dangerous. Thus why:    
 - ""they reenabled electric trim."" Because the trim wheel was non-functional.    
 - ""The pilots did their jobs poorly"" eww. I cannot believe after all we've learned, this is still being repeated. Pilots in simulators with 1000 extra feet crashed. Pilots put into the same conditions with accurate trim wheels crashed. The procedure for recovery was only created *after* Ethiopian (namely ""race"" MCAS by doing exactly what the pilots in this situation did: Re-enable e-trim, something you called them ""bad pilots"" for doing).    
 - ""failure to follow procedure"" untrue. They followed the trim runaway procedure to the letter. It left the aircraft in a dangerous configuration that they were unable to escape using the trim wheels. You have offered no solution for how they get from the end of the procedure to safely on the ground, and in fact the current recommendation was exactly what they did (re-enable e-trim) but they didn't ""race"" MCAS hard enough/re-disable.

It failed because it was bad, not because it needed to be broken up. Again, your argument doesn’t hold water here. Same with google wave.

The two examples you gave are hurting them already and had to be shut down and the workers reassigned to something else.

So what’s your point here?

They’re not humanitarian in nature, they’re profit driven and used as a tax write off more than likely. Alphabet aren’t fixing India because they care about their people. To say otherwise is laughably ignorant, especially when H1B visas are possibly going to get a massive restriction laid on them and further hurt companies who take advantage of them.

This is always a threat no matter who it is. You assigning this some altruistic value that a company being large and unhurt by the consequences of their actions as some sort of buffer for low wages is pretty fucking stupid if I’m honest. 

>	There would be less innovation, as innovations cost money and are risky.

Google has a long history of poor innovation, but that’s not even a relevant argument. Boeing has had a history of falsifying documents and lying to get products to market that result in deaths of innocent people. You’re saying their shouldn’t be consequences up to an including massive restructuring to stop them from killing people because they might not innovate? That’s a pretty poor argument.

They failed to reduce speed after takeoff, they failed to establish a proper flight condition during an emergency, and they failed to follow proper emergency procedures.

In the case of the 737's, all the planes already have two AoA sensors. All that's different between a plane with or without the optional feature is basically just a single true or false variable in the computer. Personally, I'd be pretty annoyed if Honda or any motorcycle / car manufacturer installed ABS on all of their vehicles, but had a software lockout that cost an extra $500 to access.

One of the many flaws with MCAS is that the switches that disabled automated inputs to the electric trim system also disabled the pilot's yoke switches to the trim system. Disabling electric trim entirely left only the manual trim wheels on the center pedestal as the only way to adjust the stabilizer trim. The problem with that is that when the stabilizer trim was significantly different than the elevator angle, the aerodynamic forces on the stabilizer would become so high that the manual trim wheels would become extremely difficult or impossible to rotate by the pilots. Another flaw was that MCAS moved the stabilizer in rather large steps, and each time the electric trim was switched off and back on again MCAS would forget that it had already moved the stabilizer and would move it again with another large angle step. The pilots, unable to move the trim wheels manually, repeatedly turned electric trim back on so that they could use their yoke buttons, but each time MCAS drove even more nose-down trim into the stabilizers.

Boeing is very profitable so often times they make good outcomes, but in this case the flow of ideas and decisions up and down the massive chain has culminated in a fatal flaw that has a terrible outcome. 

It’s also worth noting the carriers in both crashes aren’t blameless either, and they made their own mistakes irrespective of Boeing. Same story there with a chain of decisions up and down, and enormous fault lying with the 4 actual pilots in the cockpits of the 2 planes.

What they were ""supposed to do"" was use the trim wheels. The trim wheels weren't operable due to the aerodynamic forces (and couldn't intentionally nose-down due to low altitude).

But was the ultimate recovery procedure for recovering from MCAS. You re-enable e-trim, manually re-trim via the yoke switches, then re-disable e-trim via the cut-out switches. So they were on the right track, but didn't have enough information or 20/20 hindsight.

Sure the pilots should have known to switch off MCAS in the case of runaway but everyone can say something should be done *after the event*. When it comes down to it, if the aircraft is fighting you, and you are fighting it, you will not be thinking clearly, you will be concentrating on not crashing.  This is wholly Boeing's fault;  sure, better trained pilots may not have crashed if the MCAS system failed, BUT the system should not have failed in the first place*.   The design was bad.  The design was value-engineered to the point of being unsafe.  And the design and functionality were not well documented.  

Your argument is along the lines of the same argument Boeing used with the tail problems they had in the 90's.  *Pilots need to be better trained, it is not our design, they just don't know how to fly the aircraft.*  Perhaps Boeing should make aircraft that don't need crew intervention because a control computer received dodgy data and decided it wanted to kill 150 people that day.

South West only operates B737s, if they had to start using Airbus or anything else it would destroy their business model. The whole point is cutting costs by using one type aircraft.

Yes they can. Tesla has been burning through massive amounts of investor cash hoping it pays off in the end. They aren’t profitable but still keep the lights on. It’s not common, but selling products at a profit is not the only way a company keeps its lights on. They can and do survive in other ways. Splitting up a company *is not*  la death sentence. Companies buy and sell whole other companies all the time. The company I work for it part of a much larger business unit and they sold off a very major player in their umbrella to someone else and merged with another making them (I think) the largest aerospace and defense company in the world.

They specifically use that to circumvent a measure to prevent a foreign company from gutting a significant portion of an economic base. I’m neither here nor there on H1B policy, but it’s *only* in their best interest to get ahead of the problem. Google doesn’t give a single fuck about India.

It is. That’s why they added a system to correct the design flaw of sticking an engine on it that the airframe wasn’t designed to carry. They decided to *not* design a new airframe because Airbus was kicking their ass in sales and having a newer more versatile design meant Airbus could change the power plants without needing to design a new airframe to carry it. Boeing has a history of covering up problems and have repeatedly had the FAA levy fines against them to force them to clean up their act. Boeing didn’t make a simple error in engineering, they made a conscious compromise then designed a system to poorly address it and purposefully hid proper procedure from the aircrew saying it was no big change. It has resulted in over 300 deaths. Stop trying to whitewash this because you’re ignorant.

He’s stood on the shoulders of those around him and is vicious in his reactions to people that call him on his bullshit. You don’t remember he called someone a pedophile for doing just that? Or how when he was pointed out to be absolutely wrong he wanted to stifle the press at large to “vote” on what was allowed to be printed in the news? Or how he has cracked down on unions being formed in his plants while stupidly and erroneously calling himself a socialist?

(tl;dr company was in serious trouble even before getting in some civvie fedgov procurement vehicles, managed to utterly fail at competition with well-established awardees with one and functionally abandoned the other as they were so deep in the hole they literally couldn't even afford to hire temp labor, started replacing non-nepotism employees with high school unpaid interns (!) wherever they could, did a functional hiring and pay-increase freeze for two years and would regularly dismiss non-nepotism employees via constructive dismissal so as to avoid paying severance packages, eventually got into some very serious financial issues that resulted in company-necessary services being shut down or restricted in utility for non-payment, and six months after I left that failboat I found out they sacked the entire IT department (and replaced them with high school unpaid interns from a local tech-magnet school) and everyone who remained was asked to take a 50% pay cut or be immediately fired.)

Frankly in my opinion given the aerodynamic characteristic changes, the 737 Max should have gone through full new type certification. This isn't just a spruce up or changing in new more powerfull engines. They changed the thrust geometry on the plane, which introduced a new aerodynamic and handling characteristics. But nooo that is just a minor change, since the super smart MCAS hides the fact that the flying characteristics have changed. Which is crazy.... using a blax box algorhitm one doesn't really tell the pilots abouts to hide the fact that the flying characteristics have changed. Not even that the new characteristics are unflyable. The plane was plenty airworthy. Just that it behaved differently and had to be flown with different touch.

&#x200B;

Which was kinda stupid, since the change in characteristic itself wasn't dangerous.... Unless one assumed being used to 737 and tried to fly the MAX like previous 737. Then one was in danger of taking too much pitch up and stalling. If they were ground up type certified to 737 max flying, well there is no need for MCAS at all. Since pilots would know *plane dips up a lot, if you give it too much power and pull up. So don't give it too much power and pull up too hard. After that it is stable and this set of simulation flights demonstrates to you what is the right amount of control to use and what is too much.*

&#x200B;

One can make any plane stall with pulling too much up, so it wasn't the inherent problem. Every pilot on every plane has to deal with some extend with making sure the plane doesn't pitch up too much and stall. Though max would have guite high tendency for such (as I understand it from reporting), so it would probably be counted as peculiar plane with this specific characteristic and not the most inherently stable planes on the plane. However the real problem was Boeing didn't want to have to demand new type certification of pilots to familiarize the new aerodynamic characters, since that would mean hit on sales.

2944,"It's important to keep in mind that even highly redundant systems fail with alarming regularity.  Airbus has lost an otherwise perfectly functioning aircraft when two out of three sensors failed.  The only thing that makes me more nervous flying an Airbus aircraft is flying on a Boeing aircraft operating as a in-production test platform for their first foray into fly-by-wire (rather than their bread and butter cockpit automation).

My personal opinion on fly-by-wire is that for any aircraft that is dynamically stable (pretty much every airliner on the the planet), there needs to be a big red button on the dash that removes all computer interference and provides the pilots with as much direct control authority as possible (and here it's important to understand that fly-by-wire is just a further abstraction of hydraulic controls that amplify pilot control inputs).  

Generally, I have no problem with fly-by-wire being used for flight optimization and cockpit automation, but there needs to be some basic fundamental level of control reversion either at the pilots' discretion or when the system is experiencing some kind of odd failure mode.

Why the FAA hasn't developed a generalized model of flight dynamics that can be used to identify automation/fly-by-wire failures is completely beyond me.  Something as simple as the semiconductor gyroscopes that everyone has their phones and computers would have been able to identify the sensor failure and subsequent faulty control inputs initiated by fly-by-wire.  The problem is these systems do not have physics models and rely on too few sensors (that and the sensors have horrible failure modes... the AoA sensor fails in the 90 degrees up mode when a bird breaks off the airflow vein due to a counterweight built into the system... at bare minimum the sensor designer could have engineered the sensor to provide a negative angle of attack is the airflow vein somehow became detached).",-0.0011574074074074095,negative,Boeing Crisis,0.4994212962962963,negative

Here is what we agree on... The galley cart is just to delay while the door is unlocked and opened to give the pilot time to get the door closed if someone makes an attempt for the door. 

Now so you might understand how the system works....  It locks automatically. When the pilot needs to get back in pay attention. They either press a button and chat with the flight attendant for half a minute or they pick up the flight attendant's phone and talk to the other pilot to unlock the door.  The door is never permitted to be left unlocked unless someone is actively going through it, such as a pilot needing to use the restroom.

When that door is locked it is impenetrable to anything reasonable on board the aircraft.

I made the case that software is often used to prevent predictable failure modes. Which, I guess, given the expected consequences of this particular failure mode, yes, could be called a safety feature.

I think we fundamentally agree. I agree it's a crappy design compared to other passenger planes. I agree MCAS is an utterly flawed *implementation*. 

However, the rest of my point was that whether a design is good or bad, software is often used to artificially limit capabilities. 

We stop even well designed car engines exploding by limiting their maximum RPM - which they would otherwise happily rev to.

We stop planes crashing every day by having software ensure the speed, altitude, and attitude are all within the defined flight envelope. They would happily breach the flight envelope if that limitation was not there.

MCAS, **in theory** isn't all that different. The design makes the plane more likely to hit a failure mode. The software *in theory* prevents it reaching that failure mode. In practice, the **implementation** of MCAS has a single point of failure and should never have been certified.

I also agree that the *worst* design flaw was the lack of redundancy in the system implemented to correct for the design deficiency resulting from the decision to save money by putting bigger engines on an existing airframe that wasn’t originally engineered for them. 

Problem analysis working downstream from MCAS leads to pilot training and sensor failure. Working upstream from MCAS leads to things like the utilization of cheap foreign software programmers and passed certification despite dependency on non-redundant sensors prone to failing.

The MFG wants to go as far as they can downstream because this shifts blame further from their product which can reduce liability (pilot training and unexpected equipment failure for example). I operate in the opposite manner by going upstream and blaming whatever caused them to need to implement MCAS to begin with. 

See, it was the decision to save money at the expense of creating an unstable passenger airplane that required a software fix in order to operate correctly and safely that caused me to move this far upstream.

That's because it was.

Instead they claimed it was so close to a 737 that didn't need to go through all that and existing 737 pilots wouldn't even need additional training. The FAA are complicit at the moment and have even tried to blame the pilots for the crashes by saying they used too much power for the aircraft to recover from the stall despite the fact that only a suicidal 737 pilot would reduce power when the nose falls because increasing/decreasing power in a 737 results in nose up/down.

Set up the whole thing as a system with with four system models (both sensors green, left failed, right failed, both failed), connect it to the navigation system, develop some heuristic relationship between in-frame nav data and AoA (how acceleration maps to angle of attack, in a statistical sense to accommodate variations in wind), and treat the whole thing as a multiple-model Kalman filter (with each model of the KF corresponding to the measurement model of one failure state).  If one sensor fails, the KF will see that the covariance of the true system best matches one particular sensor failure model.  Now, even with two sensors, you can tell which one is bad, and you get some very robust statistics backing that up.  Depending on how deeply this is integrated with the navigation system (at the level of position data or raw accel/gyro measurements), you can refine the heuristic to be more or less tight.

Okay.  So, my understanding is the angular momentum is measured by a sensor, or sensor suite in one location of the aircraft.

The CPU then interprets that value as either nominal or anomaly, and the CPU executes code to take the required action that is then sent to servos to actuate to adjust the attitude of the aircraft accordingly.

In other words, if something goes wrong, the CPU is supposed to jump in with its programming and commands the control surfaces to counter.

There is no way to turn off MCAS individually.  You turn off motor control, MCAS uses the motor control, so *turning off motor control turns off MCAS*.

Putting a new control on the plane would have required re-training the pilots, so Boeing specifically made there be no way to turn off MCAS individually.

Boeing's whole argument was that ""hey, we can add this computer system, and it will work completely in the background and the pilots will never need to know about it or touch it and it cannot possibly go wrong"" and that's what regulatory approval was contingent on.  That the plane would handle and be trained in exactly the same ways as previous models.

There are definitely situations in my daily job where I can easily see that what I'm doing is stupid, yet in the end we see little reason to change it. One of the reasons is that when you're selling something that's heavily regulated in more than 100 countries, it's just easier to follow the absolutely strictest possible rules laid out (even considering potential theoretical future rules) than to try to change them. 

Another reason is that even if you yourself ""know"" that something will work, can you guarantee it under *any* circumstance? Are you willing to put your name and signature next to it, guaranteeing that it won't in any way endanger any of the potentially millions of users of the tens of millions of products that will go through this machine in its decade(s) long lifetime? 

Even old and well known pieces of hardware have weird quirks that under some insanely convoluted circumstances will fail. If that happens to your iPhone the consequences are quite low, they'd probably be limited to you having to make a trip to the nearest electronics store and complain to some teenager making minimum wage that your phone died. If it happened in an industry, production might stall. Even worse, the equipment might fail quietly allowing you to unknowingly approve something that might actually hurt someone. 

And lastly, it's part of an industry culture that is deliberately drilled into people; the idea that if you try to just once in a while cut corners, then one day in the future someone will cut a corner that will prove to be fatal for someone else. Perhaps like the one Boeing did in this case. So while it's frustrating to remain static and old-fashioned, feels like time wasting to check, check and double-check everything, then have someone else double check your work, in the end it just feels both easier, simpler and safer to have all of these checks and red tape in place.

In short: They had a problem that presented as a jammed stabilizer. (Yes, the same thing MCAS operates.) The plane was out-of-trim, but only slightly, needing a constant 10 pounds of force on the column to keep level, still fully controllable. It's likely if they'd left it alone and just landed, they'd have been fine. They did not understand how bad the actual failure was. They kept trying to move the stabilizer using primary and backup systems. Eventually they ""unjammed"" it... and it ran away to full nose down (kinda like what MCAS can do) and then a while later the whole assembly failed, the plane nosedived, and everyone died.

It was mechanical problem, not software, but the principle applies just the same:

The analogical controls are not properly designed to offer sufficient back-up if the system fails during take-off. Its not only that the pilots don't *know* how to act in the cituation, it's that the plane becomes too heavy to operate.

And even if they were, it would still be recless to desing the plane to lose potentially perfectly functional safetytools just because another part failed and they were too cheap to program that in.

Simply put, Boeing never properly considered this part to break. It can be disabled, but it then tries to re-enable itself, forcing to shut down other key components to fix, as the system has no way to detect false readings.

I also work with a lot of AAC dropouts/failures because my current profession is similar to ATC. I’ve worked with controllers who were fired with PATCO, some that took their jobs, and a bunch of people who’ve made the attempt in the last decade.

The problem at the AAC is the time hack, quality of applicants due to the biographical, and staffing. They pay very well, but it’s hard to convince someone to come out of retirement and move to Oklahoma City. It’s hard to compete with contract companies that train out of facilities where retired controllers used to work at. Then there is the fact that the AAC operates on an odd standard of rules that most facilities don’t follow which mean people don’t want to relearn everything to work there.

For every 1 controller who quit before retirement, I’ve met 5 people who went to the AAC and failed (confirmation bias I know but finding someone who bailed after 3 years of training is uncommon). Those that have left early have told me they either just didn’t like it, the schedule was killing them, or they couldn’t maintain their medical (that’s the most common one I’ve seen). Recruitment isn’t an issue since the AAC gets 10k+ applications every year when it opens, it’s a training bandwidth issue. There are only about 1700 slots a year so every failure hurts. This failure to train enough competent controllers leads to shortages at facilities. 

The attrition rates for non-retiring controllers now isn’t bad at all, but the retirements are going to overload the system.

All fracture critical parts are designed to be damage tolerant. Small cracks will occur in some parts regardless of design, the trick is to design the part to be damage tolerant using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), i.e. a small crack should not be able to grow until critical between inspection intervals during fatigue loading.

Also, regarding probability, all fatigue data is reduced using a set of parameters to ensure a probability of failure of maybe 1 in 10000000 or less per flight hour, but that differs between the criticality of the part, civilian and military applications etc.

Either/or fallacy. Either you have capitalist planes or you do not. Western being capitalist vs Eastern (which has the connotation of lacking this quality).

Capitalism is a structure of commerce that has very specific boundaries under which it fall into; Competition, open markets, collapse of ineffective/wasteful institutions, price determined by market, etc. The anthropomorphism of Capitalism actually muddies the waters when understanding these events. 

Boeing is a Publicly traded company. This is something that is determinate on how the institution acts.

Metal cracks. It just happens under stress, or from damage, or poor welding, or some guy banging into it. Generally all of it.

Cracks generally grow slowly -- until they hit a certain point, then they grow *really fast* and then things break off. That's why you're supposed to get those divots in your windshield filled, so the slow stresses don't propagate a small crack until it meets a threshold and suddenly grows across half your window.

5707,"There were several key factors involved in the MAX crashes, starting at the design phase. The lack of pilot training to deal with an MCAS failure is one, another one that is often overlooked in these comments sections was that there was not a physical switch that disables the MCAS inputs into the powered trim system, while retaining the pilot’s yoke buttons input to the same system. If Boeing had wired the switches so that disabling MCAS input to the powered trim system left the yoke buttons still able to command the powered trim system, then the pilots could have trimmed their way out of the problem quickly and neither plane would have crashed.  There were two switches in the system, but they were wired in series so it didn’t matter which switch you flipped, either switch disabled the entire powered trim system. 

Because of aerodynamic forces when significantly out of trim on the stabilizer, the manual trim wheels cannot be used to adjust trim unless you dive the plane to unload the stabilizer.  In both cases, the problem occurred during takeoff climb, there was no room to dive the plane. In fact, the pilots were trying to keep the plane from diving into the ground, and that only increased the aerodynamic forces on the stabilizer. 

 With the existing MCAS design, it would be possible to train the pilots to deal with that type of failure and MCAS reaction to the sensor failure, but that would require extensive training, enough training to require a new type certificate. In fact, during the development of that training process, it would have become apparent that MCAS was inherently flawed and needed to be re-designed.

It does not address the fact that MCAS is a crutch designed for a dynamically unstable passenger airplane - and neither should exist.

That is just a transparent attempt to distract from the fact that it is a design issue that caused these events in the first place.

But that mistake by the crew needs to not be downplayed or drowned by the politics of this investigation. Its basic airmanship. Every airplane Ive ever flown has a memory item that you do from instinct when there is a elevator control problem. Part of that procedure is to manually control the thrust. Neither crew did that.

6428,"Im not indicting the pilots but the systems they come from. Its my firm belief that there are two competing schools here. Theres the American experience weighted schools of flight training and aviation experience building.  Then there is the european book and knowledge focused school of thinking.

In general developing countries use the EASA/ICAO system. Professional pilots under those systems can get into an airliner with as little as 250 hours experience, though there is obsessive book knowledge and theory. They are then indoctrinated in airline culture and specific procedure for at least 1000 hours before they can be captains.

The American system focuses much less on theory and more on practical experience. In the US a pilot needs to have 1200 hours experience before entering an airline cockpit. I think this is where the idea that developing world pilots are inferior.

These two ways of doing things produce pilots who think differently. Anecdotally Ive seen it, its my feeling that pilots from the book learning school overthink things they, don’t react as quickly (amongst other differences.) I am not saying they are bad pilots. But in at least the second accident they thought themselves into turning the autopilot back on rather than slowing the plane down.

Boeing is not wrong in this, those pilots committed error. The procedural mistake they made by not controlling the airspeed and letting the aircraft end up in an undesired state is bad basic airmanship; below average piloting, that’d be a fail on a checkride. Re-engaging a system that was known to be causing a loss of control is an unsafe decision. There were at least 3 incidents in the US where the MCAS was activating erroneously, the crews used the procedure in place and their airmanship; no accident resulted.

This comparison between boeing and VW is stupid.Boeing, in the case of the mcas problem was at worst highly negligent.  In the case of this Air canada thing, there is no indication that this occurred to more than one jet or involved management in any way. Reading the article leads me to think that there was every possibility that negligence/incompetence as opposed to deliberate fraud is involved. With a few key exceptions, negligence is typically pursued as a civil matter.  


While what VW did was outright criminal fraud. Let me remind people what happened. Diesel engines are fuel efficient, but emit toxic exhausts that need to be cleaned up to legal standards VW had Robert Bosch build software that would detect if a diesel car was being emissions tested. The car would then produce clean exhaust for the duration of the test and only for the duration of the test. Once emissions testing was complete, the Car would then revert to its original programming and emit tens to hundreds of times the legal limit of carcinogenic, acid rain creating pollutants.  Everyone in VW's upper management knew about this and agreed to go along with it. They saved billions developing cars that were inherently incapable of meeting not just US emissions, but as it turns out emissions standards in EU countries. It would have been bad enough for them to have defrauded their customers. They then received in on billions of dollars of low emissions credits in the US designed to incentivise companies for making clean and efficient cars. They did the same in Europe. In doing so they basically stole billions from the taxpayers on two continents.  The increased emissions from their cars are linked to thousands of premature deaths around the world including an estimated 1200 in Europe. They sold 11 million cars with this cheating software. Unlike Boeing, who is seemingly running around like a headless chicken, there is a mountain of evidence that VW's managment knew exactly what it was doing. And this is what makes what they did so legally punishing both to the company and its management.

The US.gov will either frontload or increase contracts to help Boeing stay afloat from their civilian market fuckups.  Hopefully the CEO/leadership gets shitcanned too, although investor sentiment may take care of that.

> The Boeing Company’s BA Defense Space and Security segment recently won a modification contract for providing Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail kits, spares, repairs and technical services. The deal has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT. Boeing has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

> The latest modification will extend the original contract for an additional five years. **It also increased the contract ceiling by $6.5 billion to $10 billion.** The deal also involves foreign military sales. Work related to the deal will be performed in St. Louis, MO, and is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2025.

I think the flaw here was not using a faulty sensor, or even having a system that automatically pushes down the nose of the aircraft. The fault was the way the two systems interacted with each other and the assumption that were made for the certification. As I have read, the FAA was told by Boeing that the MCAS would pitch down a maximum of 0.8 degrees so in this case the use of a sensor with a ~1/100,000 failure rate is acceptable since the pilot can easily control a plane with a 0.8 degree pitch down. Airbus actually had a similar incident on a Lufthansa A321-200 (Flight LH-1829). So the fault ultimately did not lie with the sensor but with the program. The program did not stop at 0.8 degrees but allowed the htp to be pitched down to 2.5 degrees. In addition it's been speculated that every time the pilot put trim input on the stick, the program loop was reset and allowed to push down another 2.5 degrees. IMO this program was extremely rushed and flawed, but also Boeing should have told pilots about the new system and how it works. Boeing in this case cut several corners and in the end, the cumulation of negligence is what caused these two avoidable accidents.

The computer should automatically ignore an obviously bad sensor and even if not obvious a pilot should be able to tell the computer to start ignoring a sensor he believes is bad. Boeing's software update automatically disables MCAS if there is more than a 5 degree difference between the two AoA sensors or if the data from one sensor fails a sanity check or if the average data between the two fails a sanity check etc etc. All stuff that should have been there from the start. In fact they could go even further and take other sensor data into account as well as evidence for failing an AoA sensor.

The idea of using only 1 of the two sensors and swapping between them with each flight is so retarded that I cannot even begin to imagine a justification for it. The only justification I can imagine essentially ignores the existence of computer control entirely. I guess back before computers and before autopilot the system you described could be a sort of redundancy, but there is no excuse for such a system now. If you are going to have computer control at all it should be a well designed system and the system that you describe is not a well designed one. Just entirely ignoring the data from one sensor as input to the computer program? Seriously? Whoever thought that that was a good idea should go to jail and not pass go.

The pilot didn't know how to disable MCAS or wasn't able to and/or they didn't know it was malfunctioning, but I imagine they were fully aware something was going badly wrong and they couldn't do anything to stop it - their attempts to level the plane were in vain so to speak.

8398,"If these crashes proved anything they proved that the AoA sensors were indeed flight critical. Both aircraft were destroyed utterly because of a single sensor failure. Maybe correct use of logic is a problem at Boeing, allowing the use of creative re-definitions. You can call anything you want non-critical. That doesn't make it true.

At least in the case of the Ethiopian Airlines flight the bad sensor was very far off and any even remotely well written software could have detected it was bad with a simple sanity check of the ridiculous values. The software apparently thought the plane was headed nearly straight up into the air like a rocket and continued to trust the ridiculous sensor values it was returning. You don't even need a second sensor for that. Just halfway decent software design. If I had written that software I would have determined a range of obviously wrong values and auto-disabled MCAS until maintenance could replace the obviously failed sensor. Period. Without a reliable AoA sensor MCAS is useless and very dangerous as well so just disable it.

If management allowed me to make use of the second AoA sensor as well I would still make use of ridiculous input sanity checks to disable input from that sensor and switch to the other one unless there is other evidence that the plane really is headed say straight up or straight down or something crazy like that. Maybe a female computer voice just asking the pilot, ""Excuse me sir, but is the plane really rocketing straight toward the ground right now?"" 

Meanwhile my software would just assume that the other sensor indicating a relatively common situation is the correct one. What kind of shitty software designer would just assume a sensor would never fail and not bother to write a code path for that? In software design you should always be asking yourself, ""Is this software as smart as a real human would be in the same situation and if not why not?"". A real human pilot would disregard ridiculous AoA values and so should the computer and its easy to code for.

8617,"A problem is that they assumed the pilots would execute the runaway trim procedure in a timely manner, without explaining that the symptoms requiring it could be different from those of previous versions of the 737.

In the old planes a runaway trim would most likely be a pretty obvious continuous thing and the trim wheel right next to your knee would be spinning away in one direction. The way MCAS works is a relatively subtle, incremental thing. It took a while before the pilots realized they were fighting a broken system.

The thing that made the situation unrecoverable was a failure to manage the speed of the aircraft. They left it at takeoff power all the time, and the runaway trim recovery procedure says nothing about reducing power. By the time they realized they were going to have to use manual trim the aerodynamic loads caused by excessive speed made it impossible to do so.

A pilot that had been properly trained to identify and react to an MCAS failure can probably do it just fine, but these guys were presented with a fault they hadn’t been trained for in a system they didn’t know existed in a short amount of time with an inadequate recovery procedure. Arguably they should have just reverted to hand flying the plane with all of the assists turned off, but they might not have had enough time to realize this.

So called ""standard 737"" is actually 737 NG (600-800). It's the 3rd generation of 737. 1st generation 100-200, 2nd gen 300-500.

The aerodynamic is different but in no point a failure. Another example The 737-800 was stretched longer than the -700, that also changes the aerodynamic. The MCAS is only used for a particular situation. High angle of attack, high thrust, low speed, in stall, from what I understand. MCAS is not on all the time and it is NOT easy to get into such situation.

The problem of the MAX is that MCAS relies on a single AoA sensor, even though the aircraft is equipped with 2 sensors. When that sensor fails, the computer may think that MCAS is needed, to help the aircraft to get out of a stall condition that doesn't exist. Again, MCAS is not the problem.

**Comments From Peter Lemme, former Boeing Flight Controls Engineer**

* Like  all 737s, the MAX actually has two of the sensors, one on each side of  the fuselage near the cockpit. But the MCAS was designed to take a  reading from only one of them.
* Boeing  could have designed the system to compare the readings from the two  vanes, which would have indicated if one of them was way off.
* Alternatively,  the system could have been designed to check that the angle-of-attack  reading was accurate while the plane was taxiing on the ground before  takeoff, when **the angle of attack should read zero.**
* “They  could have designed a two-channel system. Or they could have tested the  value of angle of attack on the ground,” said Lemme. “I don’t know why  they didn’t.”

Per this [article](https://qz.com/1608362/boeing-says-it-didnt-deactivate-standalone-aoa-safety-alert/), Boeing intended on the disagree light being standard, but it was note. I was under the impression all aircraft had the light, and I was wrong.

The $80k feature in question is an indicator showing the amount of disagreement (at least the intent was, the article above shows that is not the case).

I don't think a pilot knowing the amount of disagreement would have impacted the outcome of either crash. In fact, the Ethiopian pilots knew what was happening, yet still failed to remedy the situation. That is proof that the indicator would not have had an impact.

The availability or cost of an additional indicator is a red herring distracting from the real cause of the crashes, which is a poorly designed software system.

8899,"> Relaxing the yoke would mean that the plane quickly does an even steeper dive so once the trim is that far, at low altitude, you seem to be in a terrible position.

The plane was not in a dive. Ethiopian Air climbed steadily for over 5 minutes, reaching about 7500 feet.

The reason it is difficult to trim up is because the yoke is already pulled back. If the plane were in a dive it would very easy to trim up without relaxing the yoke because the aerodynamic surfaces would be pushing the nose down and trimming up would be ""relaxing the push"" instead of trying to augment it. It would be as if instead of trying to lift a heavy weight you were trying lower it. It's a lot easier.

> It seems to me that their only way out would have been quicker identifying what happened as a runaway trim and cutting the power to the trim system.

The way out is to fix the trim using the training you're given. There is another way it turns out, but one couldn't expect the pilots to know it. The system only activates when the flaps are retracted. Putting the flaps back out would have also disabled MCAS leaving them with the ability to fly the plane and even use power trim. But again, I don't feel that just because this was possible that the pilots are at fault for not knowing it. It's not a normal response. Also, in the case of Ethopian Air I think it was said that the plane was reaching a rather high speed (due to the reduced rate of climb) and flaps won't extend at high speeds.

That said, yes reducing speed without an ability to pitch up is going to result in an increased rate of descent initially.

It’s a gamble that you can slow down enough to reduce the load on the pitch trim to the point where you can move it, then finally pitch up in time to avoid hitting the ground.

Nope.  That's what the problem solved by formal verification frameworks.  What they do is essentially annotate every interface with an interface contract that specifies the preconditions the interface assumes and the postconditions it fulfills. The correction of these can be verified automatically and the conditions can be arbitrarily complicated logical predicates.  This way, it is possible to avoid the need for integration testing.  Though integration testing if of course done I assume as it is industry best practice.

I live among people with a similar culture to Indonesians and well they aren't exactly the most meticulous, careful, cross all your Ts and dot all your i's type of people. So I can easily see how the problem could be overlooked and the plane flown again. If it had been a German or Japanese airline for instance there is no way that plane would have been allowed in the air again until the problem had been diagnosed and repaired, but things in Indonesia are a lot more well laid back. 

In that case at least Boeing was only partially at fault for those deaths. Lion Air needs to share some of that blame too. They are very much a low cost carrier though and maybe lacked some of the maintenance people they needed to properly diagnose the issue.

It’s my understanding that they’re relying on only 1 of these sensors for input, whereas the military is using 4 in the same place for a *similar* use case. This affords them multiple factors of safety if one sensor goes bad, gives bad readings, or even gets blown off. The computer can grab reading from all 4, and say hey this sensor is nowhere close to these others in reading. I’m not going to use it, and it doesn’t nosedive into the earth. 

What I am saying is that they’re not safety minded enough, and are simply going by what is “good enough” except when it isn’t. And when it isn’t people die.

Why? Probably because they needed the same type rating as the other 737 planes (so they don't need to do simulator training for pilots). You can't tell people about the MCAS system and require training around that. The only way to get the type rating is to pretend the MCAS never fails so that it never requires pilot input. Then when it does fail, you claim an old procedure (run away trim procedure) is required, a procedure they already know, that way you can claim that no expensive simulator training is needed.

More training was unwelcome and the existing checklist would have been considered the training necessary to deal with an AoA failure.

11730,">Basic systems knowledge would tell the pilot that the manual trim wheel is the only way to trim the aircraft.

Not sure what you mean by 'basic systems knowledge' but the trim wheel does not turn at high speeds and/or with the yoke pulled back. The ET302 pilots tried that. You can release the tension on the jack screw if you let go of the yoke and dive dive dive if you have enough altitude (is 1500 feet enough?) or maybe if you can slow the plane enough, but this procedure was 100% undocumented in any way by Boeing even after Lion Air. The roller coaster procedure was only in very old flight manuals for earlier models of 737. Obviously you can't really expect that every Boeing 737 pilot in Africa will have or remember those old manuals. 

It may have been the lack of knowledge of what to do if the trim wheel won't turn that doomed both flights and that's on Boeing for not documenting that rather obvious problem. They even undocumented it which could be seen as even worse: like they were trying to not admit to or at least downplay this failure mode in the 737. And indeed until the 737 Max it wasn't much of an issue because pretty much the only time you had to use the manual trim wheels was if the jack screw motor itself failed. In the Max any failure of the auto trim requires the use of the trim wheels that don't work in all flight conditions.

In that sense I think the technical writers at Boeing can partially be blamed unless they were specifically forbidden by management from mentioning it and required them to delete the roller coaster procedure from the manual and not to mention the necessity of it even after the Lion Air crash. To be more specific the 'runaway trim' procedure mentions nothing at all even about the possibility that the trim wheel may not turn let alone what to do if it doesn't. ET302 was only at about 1500 feet above the terrain at their maximum altitude. So they had very little room to dive anyway. They could have throttled down from takeoff thrust though. It's a mystery as to why they didn't. Their speed was definitely a contributing factor because if they had slowed down enough maybe they could have turned the trim wheel. Maybe. And maybe they would have done exactly that if it had been mentioned anywhere in Boeing documentation.

>However they failed to understand what they would lose when turning off the stabilizer trim.

Citation needed. I don't remember that detail in either the voice recordings or the brain scan records of the dead pilots. It seems implausible to me that they didn't know that. Actually the ET302 pilots did try to turn the trim wheels, but they could not. They were traveling too fast with the yoke pulled all the way back.

>The loss of electric trim isn't something that is only related to the MCAS or even the 737. Literally every flyby wire aircraft has a similar cutoff procedure.

If these pilots had been flying a 737 NG and they had a runaway trim emergency they could have just turned off the autotrim input with a single switch while leaving the electric motor to the jack screw in full operation. This has been mentioned many times in these discussions. The all or nothing nature of the stab trim cutoff switches in the 737 Max that requires the use of those trim wheels that only turn in certain flight conditions is very likely a contributing factor to the crashes.

>It can be overridden by using electric trim

Please elaborate.

 >manual trim

Yes if you are flying slow enough and have the altitude to roller coast to take tension off the jack screw. So really only in certain conditions and it may take some effort to get the aircraft into such conditions and you have to actually know about this issue even though it is entirely undocumented.

>engaging the autopilot

On ET302 the left autopilot kept turning itself off due to the bad AoA sensor on that side that gave readings as high as 74.5. If they had known about the bad AoA sensor on the left side, and this is how an AoA disagree warning or AoA indicator might have saved them, they might have saved themselves by just trying to turn on the right autopilot, but they probably didn't even know the left AoA sensor was bad. So to them the fact that the autopilot kept turning itself back off was a mystery. Also the fact that autopilot turns off MCAS was at that time undocumented I think. Not sure about that though. Certainly the Service Bulletin Boeing released after Lion Air did not mention any of those important details.

Another undocumented at the time method for turning off MCAS was to extend the flaps, but apparently this can be dangerous at such high air speeds. So one method a sufficiently clever and fast thinking pilot might have tried was to slow down the plane by any means necessary possibly including air braking and throttling down very far and then very slightly and carefully extending the flaps. Then you could turn the stab trim switches back on and use the electric trim motor to get the stab trim back to neutral. All of this should have been in the Boeing Service Bulletin after the Lion Air crash, but was not and of course before Lion Air MCAS itself was a secret so the pilots would have had to get lucky trying random stuff.

With full 20/20 hindsight I would first throttle way down and try engaging the right side autopilot and then if that didn't work I would air brake if necessary to get even slower trying to even approach stall speed and very slightly extend the flaps and then if that didn't work I would try to turn the trim wheels and then if that didn't work I would rollercoast even if the altitude was low. It may not take that much altitude loss to turn the trim wheel enough to regain at least some lift. I am not a pilot except in this arm chair, but with what we now know... 

This sort of knowledge is exactly what could have saved the pilots, but how much of it *should* the ET302 the pilots have known I am not sure. Perhaps someone can point me to some documentation Boeing released after Lion Air that fully explains all of this information. The Service Bulletin I have mentions none of it. Obviously none of this could have helped the Lion Air pilots though. Well except maybe turning off stab trim and rollercoasting. They may have had more room to dive while spinning the wheels too.

11735,"The only way to disable MCAS is by switching it off. The plane is wired  such that switching off MCAS also switches off the electric trim motors, leaving only the mechanical trim wheels as the way for the pilots to adjust trim. If MCAS has driven the trim so far out that pilots are using all elevator authority to try and counteract the bad trim, aerodynamic forces on the elevator increase loading on the manual system such that turning the wheels becomes either extremely difficult or impossible. The only way to unload the stabilizer enough to turn the wheels is by diving the plane, but when you're only up 1,500' from terrain that because suicide. Once the malfunctioning MCAS system drives stabilizer trim beyond the ability for the elevators to compensate, the plane is flying into the ground and there's not much anyone can do about it.

They do it because it is legal for them to do so and there are no consequences or they are consequences simply a matter of cost-to-benefit ratio.

Whether they think about the ethics or not is absolutely irrelevant.

The France truck rampage killed 86. The unabomber was just a disgruntled guy. The Oklahoma City truck bomb killed 168, yeah it was terrorists but the point is it can be more deadly. Making guns take more forms isn’t going to stop any of them, making guns completely illegal won’t stop any of them.

If the form identifies the lunatic as a lunatic, they’ll just lie? Maybe I over estimate their intelligence and ability to deceive.

If you're talking about a Company, senior management are very much accountable for their actions. If a company fails, it isn't the fault of the employees doing what they're told to do. It's literally management's decisive actions.

Say it's a listed entity, shareholders like myself actually give a damn about the actions of senior management.

The aerodynamic problem of the newer design is not as big a problem as some believe it to be. The main problem is the way the MCAS only uses one AoA sensor per flight, and the lack of data confirmation between both AoA sensors. This was what essentially doomed the planes. Yes, it is technically a chicken and egg problem, but this is [not the first time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas_Flight_72) faulty AoA data forced a plane to nosedive despite pilot intervention.

>Walz, of Parker Bertea, was assigned to hand-carry the servo valve to Irvine. John Calvin, the quality-control engineer from Boeing, instructed an assistant to pack up the parts. According to court records, the assistant left the room and returned with a taped package, which he handed to Walz, who carried it on a flight to Southern California.

>When Walz opened the package that afternoon at the Parker Bertea plant, he discovered that three servo-valve parts were missing: a spring, spring guide and end cap.

>Boeing, citing ongoing litigation, has never explained why those three parts were left out of the package forwarded to Irvine.

>Together, the three missing parts play a crucial role in the delicate sequence of channeling just the right amount of pressurized hydraulic fluid, at just the right moment, to move the rudder in the direction and to the degree the pilot or the automatic yaw damper has commanded. When precisely positioned inside the servo-valve housing, the spring, spring guide and end cap serve as an internal stop, preventing the outer slide from moving too far within the housing.

Additionally, the author does not exactly spare Boeing criticism. The particulars of the Max design process, the MCAS system, and the entire design ethos at Boeing receive a pretty sharp critique. Indeed, one takeaway from the article is that Airbus' approach to airplane design might be better for airlines as they presently exist, a conclusion Boeing is unlikely to appreciate.

The greater takeaway, however, is that the airlines' terrible safety practices and poor piloting are factors in the crash that are being overlooked because the narrative of a defective plane is easier to sell (and serves the interests of the airlines and the corrupt governments that have failed to adequately regulate them).

The backup plan for a failure of MCAS is rather a pain to execute. And a young pilot (one who didn't learn his craft flying manual-trim planes over Korea) is likely to not know how to do it. But since a failure of this sort is rare it is considered okay for the backup plan to be a pain to execute. If this failure were commonplace it would be required to be simpler or even automatic. But Lion Air sent up a plane that was already broken. So the failure was not in this case rare, it was all but assured.

Please read through the r/aviation and r/flying threads about this issue.  Firstly, we don't know if the Ethiopian flight was anything like the Lion Air flight other than it happened in the same phase of flight. Lion Air also had that problem reoccurring the previous four flights. That fifth flight should not have been a revenue flight, but a maintenance one. Secondly, a lot of Max 8 pilots have spoken up on Reddit here stating that they have no issues with the problems at hand because there are procedures to deal with the runaway trim issue. The issue seems to lie at the fact that certain airlines didn't go through as rigorous of a comparative training on the Max 8 vs the previous NG. Some pilots are claiming they had MCAS training, and others not.


Most importantly, we're dealing with a lot of pilots that are so used to the automation that their hand-flying skills are deteriorating. For example, perfectly clear day and Asiana puts a 777 into the ground at SFO because they couldn't hand-fly the approach because some part of the approach equipment was inop. Too low, too slow, and the FO didn't speak up. Another aspect of this is the fact that auto-pilot has always been terribly unreliable, no matter the airframe.  It's only there to assist in reducing workload, not completely fly the plane.

>The story of U.S. involvement with Saddam Hussein in the years before his 1990 attack on Kuwait -- which included large-scale intelligence sharing, supply of cluster bombs through a Chilean front company, and facilitating Iraq's acquisition of chemical and biological precursors -- is a topical example of the underside of U.S. foreign policy. It is a world in which deals can be struck with dictators, human rights violations sometimes overlooked, and accommodations made with arms proliferators, all on the principle that the ""enemy of my enemy is my friend

.

>Although U.S. arms manufacturers were not as deeply involved as German or British companies in selling weaponry to Iraq, the Reagan administration effectively turned a blind eye to the export of ""dual use"" items such as chemical precursors and steel tubes that can have military and civilian applications. 
>
According to several former officials, the State and Commerce departments promoted trade in such items as a way to boost U.S. exports and acquire political leverage over Hussein.
When United Nations weapons inspectors were allowed into Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War, they compiled long lists of chemicals, missile components, and computers from American suppliers, including such household names as Union Carbide and Honeywell, which were being used for military purposes.
>
A 1994 investigation by the Senate Banking Committee turned up dozens of biological agents shipped to Iraq during the mid-'80s under license from the Commerce Department, including various strains of anthrax, subsequently identified by the Pentagon as a key component of the Iraqi biological warfare program. The Commerce Department also approved the export of insecticides to Iraq, despite widespread suspicions that they were being used for chemical warfare.
The fact that Iraq was using chemical weapons was hardly a secret. In February 1984, an Iraqi military spokesman effectively acknowledged their use by issuing a chilling warning to Iran. ""The invaders should know that for every harmful insect, there is an insecticide capable of annihilating it . . . and Iraq possesses this annihilation insecticide.""

>In late 1987, the Iraqi air force began using chemical agents against Kurdish resistance forces in northern Iraq that had formed a loose alliance with Iran, according to State Department reports. The attacks, which were part of a ""scorched earth"" strategy to eliminate rebel-controlled villages, provoked outrage on Capitol Hill and renewed demands for sanctions against Iraq.

Murphy wrote in a September 1988 memorandum that addressed the chemical weapons question. ""We believe that economic sanctions will be useless or counterproductive to influence the Iraqis.""

>Although U.S. export controls to Iraq were tightened up in the late 1980s, there were still many loopholes. In December 1988, Dow Chemical sold $1.5 million of pesticides to Iraq, despite U.S. government concerns that they could be used as chemical warfare agents. An Export-Import Bank official reported in a memorandum that he could find ""no reason"" to stop the sale, despite evidence that the pesticides were ""highly toxic"" to humans and would cause death ""from asphyxiation.""

>The United States had gone to war declaring it must destroy an active weapons of mass destruction program. Instead, American troops gradually found and ultimately suffered from the remnants of long-abandoned programs, built in close collaboration with the West.

.


>The discoveries of these chemical weapons did not support the government’s invasion rationale.
>
After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Bush insisted that Mr. Hussein was hiding an active weapons of mass destruction program, in defiance of international will and at the world’s> risk. United Nations inspectors said they could not find evidence for these claims.
>
Then, during the long occupation, American troops began encountering old chemical munitions in hidden caches and roadside bombs. Typically 155-millimeter artillery shells or 122-millimeter rockets, they were remnants of an arms program Iraq had rushed into production in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq war.
>
All had been manufactured before 1991, participants said. Filthy, rusty or corroded, a large fraction of them could not be readily identified as chemical weapons at all. Some were empty, though many of them still contained potent mustard agent or residual sarin.
>
 Most could not have been used as designed, and when they ruptured dispersed the chemical agents over a limited area, according to those who collected the majority of them.
In case after case, participants said, analysis of these warheads and shells reaffirmed intelligence failures. 
>
First, the American government did not find what it had been looking for at the war’s outset, then it failed to prepare its troops and medical corps for the aged weapons it did find.
>
As Iraq has been shaken anew by violence, and past security gains have collapsed amid Sunni-Shiite bloodletting and the rise of the Islamic State, this long-hidden chronicle illuminates the persistent risks of the country’s abandoned chemical weapons.
>
Many chemical weapons incidents clustered around the ruins of the Muthanna State Establishment, the center of Iraqi chemical agent production in the 1980s.

.


>The United States government says the abandoned weapons no longer pose a threat. But nearly a decade of wartime experience showed that old Iraqi chemical munitions often remained dangerous when repurposed for local attacks in makeshift bombs, as insurgents did starting by 2004.
>
Participants in the chemical weapons discoveries said the United States suppressed knowledge of finds for multiple reasons, including that the government bristled at further acknowledgment it had been wrong. “They needed something to say that after Sept. 11 Saddam used chemical rounds,” Mr. Lampier said. “And all of this was from the pre-1991 era.”
>
Others pointed to another embarrassment. In five of six incidents in which troops were wounded by chemical agents, the munitions appeared to have been designed in the United States, manufactured in Europe and filled in chemical agent production lines built in Iraq by Western companies.

.

>Nonproliferation officials said the Pentagon’s handling of many of the recovered warheads and shells appeared to violate the Convention on Chemical Weapons. According to this convention, chemical weapons must be secured, reported and destroyed in an exacting and time-consuming fashion.
>
The Pentagon did not follow the steps, but says that it adhered to the convention’s spirit. “These suspect weapons were recovered under circumstances in which prompt destruction was dictated by the need to ensure that the chemical weapons could not threaten the Iraqi people, neighboring states, coalition forces, or the environment,” said Jennifer Elzea, a Pentagon spokeswoman.
>
The convention, she added, “did not envisage the conditions found in Iraq.”
Nonetheless, several participants said the United States lost track of chemical weapons that its troops found, left large caches unsecured, and did not warn people — Iraqis and foreign troops alike — as it hastily exploded chemical ordnance in the open air.

15742,"Well if this is a similar issue to the lion air crash then it's not the auto-pilot, but rather the MACS system not being turned off. Basically the Max as a different center of gravity than the normal 737, as such BA designed an auto-trim system that will pith the plane automatically even when manually flying the plane. There are extra steps needed to turn this system off and it runs independently from the auto-pilot. 

If you were no properly trained on the 737 max and are used to flying a 737 then you might erroneously think turning off the auto-pilot turns off all other of the automated systems. In this case if the MACS is getting bad readings due to poorly maintained sensors malfunctioning, then it could continue to pitch the plane down regardless of pilot inputs.

Which is hard to believe because there are usually multiple of them and in other types of systems on aircraft that make serious judgement, usually have a election system to prevent one wrong instrument from destroying the plane.

They may not have known, but perhaps that was because they didn't look. Issues with the rudder had been reported since the 70's, included several cases where the rolling was so severe to cause injuries among the crew. 

But they kept blaming it on a single, non-critical part, the jaw dampener. Because this part can only cause small deflections, it wasn't considered a safety issue. The problem was the disruptions shown were far larger than could be explained by the Jaw dampener, and completely capable of crashing a plane.

>The 737 rudder has been singled out before, however. Over the years, pilots around the world have filed hundreds of reports of 737 flights disrupted by uncommanded rudder movements.

In addition, there are accusations that Boeing hindered the investigation. For example :

>When Walz opened the package that afternoon at the Parker Bertea plant, he discovered that three servo-valve parts were missing: a spring, spring guide and end cap.

>Boeing, citing ongoing litigation, has never explained why those three parts were left out of the package forwarded to Irvine.

Those 3 parts were the parts responsible for the crash. Under certain conditions, these parts can result in a sudden reversal of control, which is what crashed all the planes. Boeing knew this :

>The British agency blamed the 747 elevator reversal on the jamming of a servo similar to the one used in 737 rudders. Its report notes that, in the course of its investigation, **Boeing informed the British agency that it had known about the servo's capacity to reverse since the mid-1970s.**

http://old.seattletimes.com/news/local/737/part02/

Despite knowing about the tendency to reverse, and being given evidence that the reversal happened by a previous incident, Boeing still argued an alternative theory. 

>Not long after the Seattle tests, the NTSB convened a closed-door meeting at which the investigators made their final arguments for a probable cause in the Colorado Springs crash. The pilots' group and United pointed to the circumstantial evidence that the PCU must have somehow malfunctioned. Boeing urged the board to accept its wind-rotor theory.

>In the end, the five-member board ruled it ""could not identify conclusive evidence to explain"" the crash. It suspended in a quandary what was to that date the most extensive air-crash investigation in its 28-year history.

And they didn't just do it once. They did time 

>Boeing's Purvis took the position that only debris large enough and hard enough to leave marks could jam the servo slides. Since no scratches or nicks were found on the New Delhi jet's slides, he said jamming and rudder reversal couldn't have caused the crash.

They can spend a billion dollars to address something that has a 0.000001% of happening and that would just not make sense because it costs too much. Everything has this cold and hard calculus applied to it. We unfortunately work with limited resources and only so much of it can be applied to safety. This isn't an issue with capitalism, it's an issue of limited resources and the need to get shit done.

Boeing will let the airliner know how risky something is and they can buy this piece of equipment to address it. All of this has to be signed off by the FAA because they have strict guidelines on how much risk they will allow aircraft to fly with.

It appears there were multiple failures involved here, primarily on Boeing. But they're not the only ones, Congress and the FAA are not blameless in this.

1. Boeing underestimated the likely hood of the issue when reported to the FAA/airlines, therefore downplaying the issue.

The whole Ethiopian flight took 6 minutes. From take-off to crash. Probably the trouble didn't start immediately from take-off so that means you have less than 5 minutes to figure out your options and to diagnose the problem (and there literally are hundreds of other problems that also cause the nose of the airplane to pitch down!), find the right checklist and to perform corrective actions, all the while you are desperately struggeling already to not crash and you are under intense stress.

Sure, this could be a lack of proper training, but it still seems the case that the root cause of the accident is that the MCAS system failed. The lack of proper training was at most a contributing factor, not the main cause. Furthermore, it can again be a case of a crew misdiagnosing the problem, the natural motion of an airplane without pitch control is a [phugoid motion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phugoid) which is very similar to the motion caused by MCAS, the pilots could have easily misunderstood their problem. In hindsight it is easy to point at the pilots, but since it seems like other pilots are also making the same mistake (even after Boeing notified airlines about the cause of the Lion air crash) shows that pilot training alone likely isn't a solution to the problem. It is the system itself that is too fault sensitive and too difficult to understand for the pilots.

The other reason the nose could suddenly dip is if the angle of attack increases, and the airspeed drops. If you can rule out a stall, and the elevators are responding, you should probably be suspicious that your trimmer wheels are spinning like mad, adding a shit ton of trim. 


The article you linked to about phugoid motion attributes it to incorrect trim. If this is what they suspected, (and it wouldn't have been since the period was far too short), but if it was, it would mean that the automatic trim was set incorrectly, and the corrective action would have been to switch to manual trim override, solving the problem.

Remember that the Lion Air crew didn't know about the MCAS. This is a big question regarding Ethiopian too, since those pilots did have access to the bulletin and had been briefed on MCAS.

Another possibility is that they cutout the trim system after the MCAS had already applied sufficient nose-down trim that the elevators alone couldn't counteract it, and they didn't have time to manually trim up enough to save the plane, remember they were flying fairly low above the ground at this point, and the manual trim wheels are relatively slow to operate manually.

This isn't a great example.

The big difference is that if your mom didn't pay for that option, the equipment wouldn't have been installed on the car. There wouldn't be a camera, or a wiring harness, or hardware to attach it to the infotainment system.

A plane with multiple AOA sensors *needs* to have a system to detect disagreement. The whole idea of having multiple AOA sensors is so that if one fails the computer can detect that one of the sensors is reporting values that don't make sense and to ignore the failed sensor. Without this sort of system the plane would either have to ignore all AOA sensor inputs, or just pick one at random to trust, both terrible ideas.

Any plane with engines mounted below the wings will want to climb its nose when you apply thrust.

The problem with this 737 Max 8 Is not the fact that it has an automatic safety system to keep the plane trimmed out of an excessive nose up condition. The problem is it that system was designed to rely on a single sensor, with no redundancy, and no way to tell the pilots that that sensor has failed. That’s not a design problem, that is a decision problem.  Boeing’s decision to do this was related to their desire to avoid having to get a new type certification.

We're talking about planes, not cars. Boeing isn't out building 737 MAXs to park on dealer lots, hoping some airline drives past and buys one. 

You can compare it to car options, you can compare it to CPU/GPU binning, but there isn't an apt comparison. This isn't profiteering at the cost of clock cycles or your mom's checking account, it's an automated control system that *kills people* when it fails.

>If that's your beef, then there's nothing wrong here. 

That's not my beef, I was pointing out why your analogy is bad, not outlining my grievances. 

Here's *some* of my beef with the design of the 737 MAX. 

AoA vanes that feed an automated MCAS system should be, ideally, triple redundant. Triple redundancy allows an automated system with a failed sensor to examine all three inputs, then determine which sensor is bad, and exclude it. However, this is more expensive and will result in more downtime and maintenance, so it's not a common practice for systems that have human operators, and usually only found on stuff like space probes, satellites, military drones, etc. 

Double redundancy is fine for a system with a human operator, as long as two criteria are met. First, the system has to notify the operator that there is a disagreement between the sensors, and second, has to allow the operator to toggle which of the sensors is being used by the automated system. This allows the operator to say ""Hey, there's a disagreement between the AoA sensors, if there's any weird behavior related to miscalibrated AoA sensors then I should flip this switch to stop the flight computer reading one sensor and have it read the other and see if that fixes the problem.""

But even if such a system doesn't give the operator control over which sensor is being read, or even a disagreement notice, it's still probably okay, as long as the operators are trained on the unusually designed system and can quickly disable the automated control system. There's a much higher cognitive load placed on a pilot if he needs to diagnose and fix issues with a control system than if they're simply given a ""Give me control of the plane, now"" button. 

At the very least the MCAS system should go into some sort of failure mode when it detects that the two sensors are in disagreement, instead of retaining 100% of its control authority. 

To start, my beef is that *none* of those things are true. 

* Boeing's AoA disagree light was not functional on *any* 737 MAX delivered to *any* customer.

* Boeing's software did not provide a way for pilots to change which AoA sensor was being read by the MCAS system.

* The system was not designed to disable itself or reduce control authority in the event of a disagreement. 

* Boeing did not inform airlines or pilots that there were significant differences in the 737 MAX's MCAS system compared to previous 737s, including the *massively* increased control authority of the MCAS system.

This design flaw constitutes a single point of catastrophic failure. An AoA sensor failing, causing the MCAS to malfunction and the stabilizer trim to runaway, leaving the plane in a completely unrecoverable state is... unbelievable. It is a symphony of errors in design, engineering, implementation, documentation, and review. It is a failure the scale of which I can not describe. 

But the really fucked up part is that the system would have worked. An AoA disagree warning would have allowed both crews to mitigate the issues caused by a failed MCAS system, but Boeing decided on one hand to be so fucking greedy that they'd *disable the safety system that was completely functional so they could charge for it as an option*, and then on the other hand were so fucking incompetent that they didn't even tell their customers that it was disabled, and by doing so caused the deaths of hundreds of people. They took a goddamn standard safety feature, paid their engineers develop functionality that allows them to disable the feature in software, then just told their customers it still worked *and never even tried to sell it*.

That's my fucking beef.

You're dead on about the communication.  From the engineers to the manual writers, to FAA/ICAO, to operations and training at the airlines, and thence to the pilots.  At each step, a risk assessment is made or is not made.  IMO, it's easier to eliminate all that with a multiple redundant system.

Your third paragraph is spot on.  I would even say that my opinion has shifted somewhat.  The first sentence of your third paragraph hits the nail on the head.  The MCAS should have merited the treatment of a new design.  I'm not comfortable saying they could have implemented MCAS without requiring difference training.  

Difference training would have solved many of the communications problems.  It would enable the stakeholders to bring to light questions about failure modes that may not have been considered.

Then in the sim, they can find out how manageable the pitch rate is, and find out if it induces spatial D during a go around in weather.

I would almost say the root cause was an attempt to navigate loopholes to save money.  That ensured the communication didn't happen, and it insured that those pilots wouldn't have the system knowledge to deal with a single failed system on on otherwise flyable airplane.

A - It is not disputed by Boeing that the customers and Boeing Flight Test were not a part of remedial programming of the flight control system which was farmed out to offshore programmers. It's likely that Boeing failed to deliver aircraft that met the FAA approved certificate. 

B- It is not disputed that aircraft delivered to Southwest (and others) had the AOA anomaly warning light installed but that it was disabled by Boeing prior to delivery and customers not notified. 

C - It is not disputed by Boeing that changes to the flight control programming increased the rate at which pitch up trim was applied by the flight control system.

18466,"You don't speak of just the plane, you speak of it as a system. The plane, the pilot, the procedures. The plane technically doesn't have a SPOF, well, not one that came into play here. The way this kind of thing works in aeronautics if you have to have to estimate the chance of failure and then for failures which are sufficiently likely (I forget, like more likely than 1 in 100 million or something, I probably have that figure wrong) you are required to have a backup plan.

How the backup plan must be implemented is also determined by how likely the failure is. If the failure is relatively likely the plane must carry on essentially seamlessly with no intervention, just less functionality. For example if the in flight entertainment system breaks the plane can go on with no in flight entertainment and unhappy passengers (yes, the IFE is covered by this system of analysis too). If the failure is less likely the backup plan can be a big pain in the butt because it's not likely to be used (but it should work if it is used). If employing the backup plan leaves the plane without an additional backup plan then the plan must also say ""and land within X amount of time"" because you don't want to chance an additional failure you can't deal with.

There are several issues at play here.

The backup plan for MCAS failing and trimming the nose down requires knowledge of the pilots which apparently modern pilots don't have. They expected the pilots would know how to manually trim a plane by manipulating the controls to get the aerodynamic forces to help them out (or at the least not impede them). It appears that pilots don't have this knowledge. They likely did when the plane was designed in the 60s, as most commercial pilots then had experience flying large planes with manual trim in WWII, Korea, etc. But now it seems even a professional pilot cannot be relied upon to know this.

It's as if you made a semi truck and expected that the drivers would know how to operate it safely without working anti-lock brakes. If you designed it in the 60s then surely professional drivers would know this. But if you keep using the same design (or operational methods) in the 2010s you'd likely find that a lot of drivers, despite being professionals (and thus in theory the best drivers on the road) have never driven a truck without ABS and hence don't know how.

Boeing's backup plan, properly (maybe, see below) designed based upon their calculations of likelihood of failure required that pilots have working knowledge it seems they don't all have. And so when the backup plan had to be used the planes crashed. We know the backup plan could work, as the pilot flying the same Lion Air plane on the flight before the fatal crash had the same problem with the AoA sensor, employed the backup plan (without having 737 MAX-specific training about it), saved the plane and continued the flight. More on this later.

A significant second factor was that the MCAS system didn't really operate the way Boeing's plans envisioned. The NY Times reported on this about two weeks ago. They designed MCAS one way, and then changed it to have it cover more circumstances. It appears they also didn't do sufficient requalification after doing so. So the system would kick in multiple times in a row in the stall case (or the case where the AoA sensor was bad and indicated a false stall). This meant the MCAS system would not only didn't use both AoA sensors (as the autopilot) but it also ignored another sensor (speed, I think, but it might be pitch, I forget right now) which also would have helped it not pitch down multiple times in a row in the false stall case. This changed the MCAS system enough (without requalification) that the calculations of the likelihood of failure Boeing made may not have been correct. If they weren't correct, then the backup plan may not have been inappropriate (in terms of difficulty) for the situation which which arise.

Another factor was that in the Lion Air crash, the chance of failure was not 1 in 100M or whatever. It actually was 1 in 1. This is because the plane was already misoperating before they sent it up with people on it. As mentioned above, the pilot before saw this failure mode but saved the plane. It is also believed that pilots before that pilot saw similar issues. This means it wasn't a small chance of the pilot needing to use the backup plan, it was a 100% chance. So the plane was known bad and known bad enough that the plane should have been fixed and sent up on a test flight with no passengers to verify it was okay. Instead Lion Air sent it up with passengers on it and without a proper fix. 

Additionally, while the training needed to save the plane was not 737 MAX-specific (as evidenced by a Lion Air pilot using the procedures documented on the 737 NG to save it when it failed) Boeing certainly was spending a lot of effort telling airlines (and by extension pilots) how much it was the same as the previous 737 instead of telling them how it was different (i.e. MCAS).

So you have multiple factors leading to these crashes. For Ethiopian there is the issue that the pilots did not have the capabilities that the backup plan expected. There is also the issue that the MCAS system did not work as Boeing planned since it didn't use enough available information (sensors). The lack of knowledge MCAS' existence was not in play since it was widely publicized after the earlier Lion Air crash.

For Lion Air there is the backup plan expected capabilities the pilots didn't have. There is the MCAS design issue. There is the lack of knowledge of MCAS' existence. And there is the airline sending up a broken plane without fixing it properly and verifying it without 300 people on board that it was fixed. That is unless you think the pilots hid the information from the airline in which case it is the pilots' fault that it went back up with people. But personally while the pilots should have refused to fly the plane again with passengers unless it had been test flown I put the failure to ground that plane on the Lion Air.

So there are multiple factors which caused these two crashes, not an actual SPOF in either case. The rectifications are plain:

1. Fix MCAS to use more sensors and not activate multiple times in a row. And requalify it this way.
2. Create a backup plan which is in line with reasonable expectations of modern professional pilots' capabilities. This most likely would mean repurposing one of the switches on the controls to turn off MCAS/autopilot as a group. And the other to turn off pilot-input power trim (the trim switch on the yoke). Thus the pilot can turn off the failed automatic system but keep the power trim he is used to.
3. When significant issues with controllability are reported, airlines must repair the planes properly and verify they are fixed. They should not send the plane back in the air with passengers until it is verified fixed with a test flight.
4. Boeing (and indeed no one, Airbus does this too, just not fatally) should hide changes in a plane from the pilots and airlines to sell it as if it were identical to the previous plane.

This is why hundreds died. No SPOF. And these (and perhaps other things) are the fix. None even require changing the airframe. You might have to change the flight controls though for that switch.

If nose-up trim is required, raise the nose well above the horizon with elevator control. Then slowly relax the control column pressure and manually trim nose-up. Allow the nose to drop to the horizon while trimming. Repeat this sequence until the airplane is in trim.

Airplanes are full of modules. If pilots had to know how all of them worked in detail they would never leave the ground. Some level of abstraction is necessary. And you don't want to unnecessarily burden a pilot with a need to work through some complex chain of analysis and reasoning in a physically awkward, time critical, life threatening situation.

Boeing appear to have reasoned that, as long as the normal runaway trim recovery procedure handled MCAS failure scenarios too, there was no need to burden pilots with some additional knowledge and work to deal with it. Because that would be less safe than just making sure the existing procedure worked.

The pilots in these accidents did actually carry out the procedure and in doing so successfully disabled MCAS. Unfortunately they allowed the airspeed to build up to a point where they would have had to use the procedure I described. And apparently that isn't part of the recovery procedure as it's currently taught.

While MCAS is clearly flawed, I think the liability for damages is going to come down to whether or not the accident was primarily due to poor airmanship (allowing the excessive speed to build up) or an inadequate recovery procedure.",-0.09455555555555556,negative,Boeing Crisis,0.45272222222222225,negative

18490,"The problem here is that elevator authority is not capable of overriding stabilizer authority. The pilots pulled full back stick, maximum elevator, but it wasn't enough to climb, much less maintain altitude. Remember, the elevator control surface is just that narrow strip on the trailing edge of the stabilizer. The stabilizer entirely moves using the trim system. If the pilots had been trained on a well-documented MCAS system including the fact that MCAS relied on a sole critical sensor, and if Boeing had developed training manuals to cover an MCAS-based trim runaway, then it's a pretty safe bet that the pilots would have immediately recognized the exact failure and executed a documented procedure to deal with it. The fact is that neither of those things existed, neither the full training and knowledge of MCAS nor established and trained procedures to respond to such a failure.

What needs to happen is that all aircraft are retrofitted with an AoA disagree warning system; All aircraft modified so that MCAS uses both AoA sensors as well as artificial horizon inputs to develop trim outputs; The amount of trim authority, in both speed of response and amount of angle, be limited; MCAS failure scenarios need to be implemented into pilot training processes; The MCAS cutout switch(es) be separate from electric trim cutout switches, this way electrically-assisted trim is still available when MCAS is disabled. Boeing fully document the MCAS system in all available aircraft documentation and manuals, including likely and unlikely failure scenarios and recovery procedures for those scenarios.

My comment that you seemed to have taken offense with is the fact that they likely didn't have enough altitude to do a rollercoaster trim recovery even if they'd been trained for it, which they apparently were not. You believe that it's possible to unload a nose-down trimmed stabilizer without losing altitude. It doesn't work that way. To unload the stabilizer requires flying the plane in such a way as to provide neutral forces on the stabilizer. In these cases it would require diving the plane since the stabilizer was driven to nose-down trim by MCAS. At two or three thousand feet AGL that's a high-risk maneuver.

The big picture here is that Boeing poorly implemented a system that was capable of overriding the pilots' inputs and flying the plane into the ground, and didn't bother mentioning that system's existence and failure scenario possibilities to the airlines buying these planes or the pilots flying them. It is impossible to blame the pilots in any way for not properly dealing with a flight control system that they didn't know anything about, much less were not trained on how to respond to malfunctions with.",-0.015403304178814385,negative,Boeing Crisis,0.4922983479105928,negative
18492,"No, I’m not.

The “turning itself back on” you’re referring to is the MCAS system behavior when it inhibits itself for something like 10 seconds after a pilot uses the yoke mounted trim switch. This is where the “fighting MCAS” comes from.

18494,"I’m not sure where you’re seeing the two possibilities for blame. There’s the airspeed issue, maybe, what was the other one?

I mean you could argue that they should have got the plane into level trim with the pilot controlled electric trim prior to using the trim cutout switches. That would have worked (and it disables MCAS for a few seconds while they’re working on it, so it wouldn’t have been fighting them). But I don’t think the procedure recommends that, so I don’t think they can be held accountable for not doing that.

Similarly the roller coaster might have worked if they tried it early enough (someone else claims the elevator doesn’t have enough authority once the stabilator has been driven too far). But like I said, Boeing removed that from the training some time ago.

If I’m blaming anything it’s the inadequate recovery procedures and training. MCAS is terrible but keep in mind that it isn’t the only way the trim can go wild. If the plane can get into an unrecoverable state in spite of proper training and piloting it’s a bigger problem than just the Max, it’s the whole 737 fleet.",-0.08671875,negative,Boeing Crisis,0.456640625,negative
18495,"The Max is the first model to get MCAS. Runaway trim that flies the plane into the ground hasn't happened before because MCAS hadn't existed before. Like I said, this is an MCAS problem, not a pilot problem. It's not a pilot problem because the pilots weren't told about MCAS, how MCAS could fail due to a single sensor malfunction, nor did Boeing offer any training guidance on dealing with a defective MCAS system. One of the defects I forgot to mention was that MCAS drive the stabilizer trim in large, extremely large, increments, and each time MCAS was reset it ""forgot"" where it was and added yet more trim in 2+ degree increments. That large increment was added at the last minute by engineers without going through the FAA and nobody outside Boeing knew about it at all. 

I have no idea out that much incompetence could go into a design, I wonder if it was deliberate in some way? I mean, though I've got a little familiarity with aeronautical engineering I'm not an engineer, and even I know that relying on a single sensor with a well-known history of failure is a terrible idea. AoA sensors fail on average about once a month across most commercial aircraft, that's why there are usually more than one on any given plane. Designing the MCAS disable switch to also disable electric trim was also an incredibly incompetent decision. What it ensured that if there was an MCAS trim runaway that the only way to recover trim was with the manual trim wheels using a procedure that was no longer documented, and in any case was not safe to use at low altitudes, the very same low altitudes at take off that MCAS is designed to operate at. 

No, this entire debacle is directly tied to a faulty MCAS design and implementation, an MCAS system that exists on no other Boeing 737 model. This was a failure of both engineering and of management. It was also a failure of regulation in that the FAA allowed Boeing to self-certify MCAS. Boeing clearly failed to understand the safety implications of MCAS, utterly failed. Frankly, the engineers on this system should be stripped of their PEs and fired, and the managers involved in both MCAS and the self-certification process should also be fired.

In certain circumstances wind flutter interaction with the AOA probes could cause intermittent compliance flags to the MCAS system causing nose down overtrim. Due to the transient nature of the signals the stall redundancy routine would not be triggered (transient signals of under 10-15ms), which would otherwise cross reference other flight parameters for validation, so a single point of failure became possible through the AOA probe, leading to progressive nose down trimming with no associated stall or comparator warnings. Only when the nose down trim reaches the stops does the stick shaker and associated stall cacophony come on, causing utter confusion as airspeed is progressively increasing, pitch falling, STAB TRIM is fully nose down, and any nose up elevator input seemingly produces no effect due to the massive stabilizer force. Seeing how the MCAS architecture wan't briefed to pilots, the massively confusing and contradictory warnings, the response to such a situation, especially in high workload phases of flight can easily lead to the unfortunate events we saw in Indonesia and now Ethiopia.

It didn't help the media went berserk about the issue and there was false reporting coming out of ABC News where some dude shave down wiring, installed some components and then short circuited the ECU and claimed it would cause unintended acceleration (like that even replicates normal driving).

Basically people made a lot of noise, made it seem like Toyota was at fault, when in reality it came down to driver error. Even though floor mats were recalled only one accident was even linked to floor mats, and even in that case the installed mat was for the wrong car and was not even installed correctly.

7) Plane continues to stall as Bonin keeps pulling up. The captain is called and enters the cockpit.   
8) Stall warnings [which had been going off for nearly a minute at this point] fail because the plane is now so badly stalled that speed indication has become unreliable   
9) Stall warnings go of intermittently whenever the results become reliable. Plane never comes close to a normal angle of flight.

19605,"In the end, that's not inaccurate but there's more complexity to it. Basically MCAS is designed to move the horizontal stabilizer trim to nose down direction when approaching high angle of attack, at a high speed during *manual flight* only. There are 2 flight computers (FCCs), each bound to an AoA vane (the sensor in question) on either side of the a/c. Only one FCC provides MCAS commands at a time. Again, this cycles between flights. It's complicated but there are reasons for this.

To the issue at hand - during manual flight it was seen that erroneous AoA data (due to faulty hardware or potentially software) could cause uncommanded nose down stabilizer trim via MCAS during manual flight. The trim switch could override this, but only temporarily, if the erroneous signal was still being fed from the FCC. Seconds later trim would go nose down again, and unchecked could reach the nose down limit. That's the 'runaway stabilizer trim' issue in question. However, the system can be disabled altogether with the flip of 2 switches on the throttle quadrant (sadly the JT610s pilots did this, which stopped the problem, but then reenabled it before their crash). In theory it's a simple issue to overcome but when a) pilots aren't properly briefed on the system b) workloads are high c) ALT / IAS / AoA disagree warnings are going off d) a tertiary AoA readout isn't (optionally) installed it can make for a incident.

As I said, as much as this article makes any sense it appears to be about MCAS.

MCAS did rely on only one AoA sensor. And AoA sensors ""have a known history of failure"" only as much as every other sensor does. You have to know the likelihood of failure of the sensor and the danger if it fails. And if it is more than a certain likelihood and dangerous if it fails then you must have a backup plan. This backup plan must also be evaluated and if it has high enough chance of failing it must have its own backup plan.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_analysis

Boeing's backup plan for MCAS going haywire due to the AoA sensor breaking is that the pilots will switch off *all trim* and trim the plane manually. The problem is it seems current pilots cannot be reasonably counted on to be able to trim a plane manually. It probably was reasonable when the plane was designed in the 1960s, but now it isn't.

So the problem wasn't the sensor was too likely to break, the problem was the backup plan wasn't effective because the pilots were part of it and the pilots couldn't execute it. It is believed now (I feel reasonably) that you can't count on the pilots to be able to manually trim the plane. Therefore personally, I feel that the switches should changed so that the pilot can turn off MCAS' ability to power trim the plane but leave the pilots' ability to manually trim the plane from the power trim switch on the yoke. This how the 737 NG (previous model) handled runaway autopilot trim commands. You turn off the AP's ability to power trim and you keep pilot manual power trim. Boeing didn't do this for MCAS. I feel they should.

Instead, it looks as if Boeing is going to alter MCAS with sufficient redundancy such that the likelihood of MCAS failure is low enough that they are not required to have a backup plan. Personally, with how complex software is now, I wouldn't trust that sufficiently. I'd rather have a way to switch off MCAS and leave pilot power control.

The new problem which was found has been referenced in some other articles. It has at time been said to be due to ""computer overload"" in MCAS and traced to certain ""erroneous signal inputs"". This failure ""had not been reproduced in flight"" but instead on a test setup. It's unclear exactly what this means. Were the signal inputs just broken sensors? Or did someone hook up a signal injector to the system and inject intentionally broken signals in a way to try to confuse MCAS? Either way, looks like as I said above that they are going to attempt to harden MCAS to bad inputs instead of making it easier for pilots to turn off MCAS and continue flying themselves.

I find this a strange choice given Boeing says MCAS isn't even a safety (anti-stall) system, just a system to keep pilots from trying to use a part of the flight envelope (certain combinations of climbs and banks) which doesn't behave the same on a 737 MAX as on a 737 NG. If that's really all MCAS does, then a pilot who is trained on the new envelope should in theory be able to just turn off MCAS for the entire flight.

A single sensor?  Normally there are two on big commercial airliners.  The are like little windvanes on either side of the front of the aircraft to sense the angle of the airflow with respect to the plane.  When the angle gets too high the software can detect that a stall is likely.  But why would they rely on only one of them?  These things stick out into the airflow and are relatively vulnerable to damage.  If something hits the vane (e.g., a bird) or something else causes a problem with the sensor then the inputs to the MCAS system are going to be bogus.  Part of the reason for having two of these things is for redundancy, but also because when a plane rolls the two sensors usually point in opposite directions anyway (one up, one down).

They would've needed to aerodynamically unload the elevators (ie. pitch the aircraft down) to relieve the load on the stabilizer and allow them to trim manually, which given their low altitude and high speed would've been unsafe. Meanwhile they were picking up speed, increasing those forces, with no real options to lose speed. They certainly should've cut the throttles, but at 300+ kts when they initially cut out the trim, it doesn't seem all that likely this would've saved them. It appears they turned the electric trim back on in a bid to regain control of the trim because they were unable to adjust it manually and were losing control of the plane. It was a hail mary.

i know.. because they could not get enough nose up trim from the elevator..  they turned it on to get the electric trim motor to get the elevator into a flyable position.. get the nose up..

 if they had understood the MCAS.. they could have had the pilot call out electric trim switches on.. while he  was thumbing the trim up... trim up.. then while he was still thumbing trim up. the copilot turned the electric trim switches off.  this should have left them in a flyable position.. but the Mcas..freaked as soon as they let go of the trim thumb wheel and nosed it down. but they were also going over 400Kts at take off throttle and any downward trim would nose them right into the ground.. 

 if you are ever in a 737 simulator get the instructor to let you and him or you and the co pilot try.. switches on, thumb trim up. thumb trim up. switches off.    if you don't have enough elevator .. perform again.. takes 2 people to do it properly .. so the stab trim switches are turned off either before the pilot stops input or just as..

Please read through the r/aviation and r/flying threads about this issue.  Firstly, we don't know if the Ethiopian flight was anything like the Lion Air flight other than it happened in the same phase of flight. Lion Air also had that problem reoccurring the previous four flights. That fifth flight should not have been a revenue flight, but a maintenance one. Secondly, a lot of Max 8 pilots have spoken up on Reddit here stating that they have no issues with the problems at hand because there are procedures to deal with the runaway trim issue. The issue seems to lie at the fact that certain airlines didn't go through as rigorous of a comparative training on the Max 8 vs the previous NG. Some pilots are claiming they had MCAS training, and others not.


Most importantly, we're dealing with a lot of pilots that are so used to the automation that their hand-flying skills are deteriorating. For example, perfectly clear day and Asiana puts a 777 into the ground at SFO because they couldn't hand-fly the approach because some part of the approach equipment was inop. Too low, too slow, and the FO didn't speak up. Another aspect of this is the fact that auto-pilot has always been terribly unreliable, no matter the airframe.  It's only there to assist in reducing workload, not completely fly the plane.


Until we get a little more info on the Ethiopian incident, I'm going to reserve judgment that this is a reoccurring problem.

>The 737MAX is **not airworthy** without MCAS. MCAS is artificial stability augmentation. It was created to overcome the pitching effect that resulted from Boeing's decision to stuff 70"" turbofans under the wing of an aircraft originally designed for 40"" turbofans. This required the engines to be moved further forward of the wing, which produced a more pronounced pitching effect at high power and high pitch attitude than the FAA was willing to accept. Boeing decided to solve this with software alone. And they did. MCAS works. Except when it has bad data to guide it. The solution is... oh... so... simple: data source redundancy. Either MCAS doesn't have this, or it's not working reliably. There are two ways to go about this redundancy. There is the fail-safe approach and there is the fail-passive approach. The fail-safe approach is cheaper. It simply requires the system to disengage if both data sources are in disagreement with one another (beyond a safe threshold). But this is problematic because this means a single sensor failure renders the aircraft unstable at certain attitudes (and thus no longer airworthy). The fail-passive approach is more expensive. It requires you to add a third data source and logic to 'vote' between all three sources. If two of the three sources are in agreement, the system deactivates the bad sensor and the remaining two continue to provide artificial stability for the rest of the flight.  
>  
>Boeing either opted for the cheaper option of fail-safe or provided no redundancy at all. And the FAA let them.  
>  
>To understand how a fail-safe option could lead to a crash, we need a little history lesson. Turkish Airlines flight 1951. Boeing provided fail-safe redundancy on the original NG autothrottle logic. If both radalts were not in agreement, the system was designed to disengage. The problem was, it didn't always do this. Before the Turkish 1951 crash, there had been about a dozen known cases of the autothrottle continuing to operate on a single, malfunctioning radalt. As a result, Boeing decided in 2003 to refit all NG's with a newer, reliably redundant autothrottle. But they didn't require a retrofit for existing NG's and they didn't tell NG operators (and their pilots) about the issue. in 2009, Turkish Airlines flight 1951's pre-2003 autothrottle transitioned to flare mode at the wrong moment and the aircraft crashed because the logic was erroneously operating with radalt data in disagreement. Thus, due to a known issue, it had no redundancy and was not fail-safe at all. There was a lesson it that tragedy. Did it sink in?  
>  
>The MCAS system might have a similar flaw or it might have been designed without redundancy. Neither Boeing nor the FAA is currently talking about this.  
>  
>But was artificial stability augmentation a bad idea to begin with?  
>  
>Another history lesson: the MD-11. To achieve a lower drag by reducing the massive size of the DC-10's enpennage, it required an artificial stability augmentation system called LSAS. The system was problematic from the start. It didn't lead to any passenger fatalities, but it did lead to some pretty scary upsets. It also left the MD-11 with a rather challenging pitch behavior in the flare, which may have contributed to a couple of fatal freighter crashes. Airlines quickly dropped the MD-11, citing a lack of operational range performance, but pilots reported that is was challenging to land and I have to wonder if that was a deciding factor in its demise as a passenger aircraft.  
>  
>So here we are. Boeing, having made the unwise decision in 2011 to postpone the (Y1) 737 replacement and to cobble together a higher-bypass version of their venerable 1960's airframe instead, is now dependent on artificial stability augmentation to keep it certified. That system is now proven to be unreliable (since October of last year) and known to be capable of leading to a fatal upset. Yet it remains airworthy according to the FAA. Why?  
>  
>Boeing currently has over 4700 orders for the 737MAX aircraft range. It won those orders, despite fierce, race-to-the-bottom competition from the 320NEO (in which list prices were cut in half on both sides) by assuring customers that the NG had very little transition expense for airlines currently operating the NG. This is why Boeing didn't inform pilots about the new artificial stability augmentation system. This is probably also why Boeing didn't make the system more robust. That would have required additional hardware, added expense and added maintenance. Would the revelation that the new 737 depended on artificial stability augmentation, and everything that goes with it, have cost Boeing some of those orders? Would grounding the fleet and requiring a significant system modification following a fatal crash in October have caused them to lose some of those orders? How disinterested is the FAA with a company that makes a significant contribution to the nation's export economy?  
>  
>If this crash turns out to be a repeat performance of last October's crash--and really, even if it doesn't--the fleet needs to be grounded and MCAS needs to be redesigned to a higher, fail-passive standard of redundancy. This means adding hardware as well as modifying software. It means holding Boeing to the same standard required of Airbus when they first certified computer-augmented flight control. Once this is done, the 737MAX will be among the safest aircraft in the skies.  
>  
>But it will require Boeing to pay the tough price for its previous lack of vision and its short-term-investor-driven management culture. Boeing is unlikely to do that unless the FAA ends this bromance and shows the same some tough love they gave to Airbus.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAM_Airlines_Flight_3054 - ""One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings.

The aircraft computer system’s programming logic had been designed to reject one sensor value if it deviated significantly from the other two sensor values. In this specific case, this programming logic led to the rejection of the correct value from the one operative angle of attack sensor, and to the acceptance of the two consistent, but wrong, values from the two inoperative angle of attack sensors. This resulted in the system's stall protection functions responding incorrectly to the stall, making the situation worse, instead of better.""

The plane trims down repeatedly because the system didn't cut off. The issue here is that the system misbehaves, and that does definitely relate to the sensor input and control loops.

He uses ""fail-safe"" to refer to a system which would become unairworthy (according to him) in the case of ceasing to operate. That's unsafe and certainly not what fail-safe means. The system he's complaining about is fail-operational. When it gets bad inputs it keeps working and becomes unsafe.

He speaks of Being saving money by being ""fail-safe"" when it isn't fail-safe at all (given his assumption that the plane is non airworthy without the system operating). It's closer to being fail-passive, meaning the system still operates and the pilot is expected to complete the flight. Although again, it's very possible it is fail-operational meaning it basically works against the pilot who is trying to complete the flight. That's what the cutout switches are for.

He covers it better when he gets past those errant descriptions and just talks about the amount of sensor redundancy. He's really talking about fault-tolerance more than the systems cutting out.

Any rotation of the aircraft is gonna be around the CoM barring any really weird edge cases, right? So the lever between the CoT and CoM determines rotation induced by thrust, and the one between the CoL and CoM determines lift-induced rotation. 

Pitch stability in level flight is typically achieved by having the CoL behind the CoM. Any rotation moves the lift surface in to the oncoming air, and since all or most of the lift surfaces are behind the centre of mass the resultant force pushes the lift surfaces back towards being in line with the CoM. This workss so long as the plane is moving forward, thrust or no.

The thrust force is indeed balanced out as you say, but by drag rather than the other two factors. You've got (in rough terms, because the directions of these forces are broadly orthogonal under normal circumstances) lift pushing up, gravity pushing down, thrust forwards, and drag pushing back.

21252,"I work in flight data analysis as a data scientist. The general consensus from the pilots and aviation geeks at work is this:

There are two sensors at the front of the 737 MAX aircraft that monitor the angle of attack (angle between airflow and control surface of wing - basically measures lift).

These AoA sensors’ readings typically match up to within a few degrees (they can be slightly apart if the aircraft is performing a roll, for example). For some reason there seems to have been a systematic failure in both of the crashed 737 MAX aircraft where one of the two AoA sensors is massively misreporting (approx a 20 degree difference in the case of Lion Air). This discrepancy between the two sensors is enough to trick the aircraft’s MCAS system into thinking the aircraft is about to break out of it’s envelope (i.e. that it will stall because it’s at the wrong angle).

When this happens, part of the MCAS system kicks in and engages a hydraulic ram that literally forces the control column forward, which in turn pushes the nose of the aircraft down. In the case of the two crashed aircraft, this hydraulic ram was activated in incorrect circumstances because of the faulty sensor.

There is a temporary way to disengage the MCAS system (i.e. pulling back on the control column), but MCAS is designed so that the system has control the majority of the time - not the pilot. That means that even if a pilot takes 5 seconds to correct the action taken by MCAS, the system will “re-correct” for even longer.

Pilots can theoretically disengage the MCAS system for the duration of a flight, but my understanding is that it’s difficult to trace the handling problems exhibited in the affected flights down to MCAS. This problem can be kind-of remedied by Boeing installing a “disagree light” - an indicator that lights up when there are unusual readings from the AoA sensors. When this lights up, pilots can manually disengage MCAS - but this was an optional extra feature that wasn’t installed on the two affected aircraft - hence the crashes.

I can’t begin to imagine how terrifying that must have been for the crew on those flights - knowing that your aircraft is actively trying to crash into the ground, and having no idea why and not being able to do anything about it.

This is a major engineering catastrophe and Boeing should have installed the disagree light by default. I mean, who the hell makes a vital safety component an *optional extra*?",-0.07177777777777779,negative,Boeing Crisis,0.4641111111111111,negative

Boeing engineers did not want to build something like the MAX,they viewed is a band aid at best, they much preferred to start from scratch, but went with the MAX to prevent Airbus getting too strong a market lead.

When they decided to have MCAS intervene automatically, they had it use only one of the sensors. This broke the rules about single path of failure.

I'm not certain, but I believe I read that the maximum rate of trim change MCAS was capable of was intended to be much lower than the final result. Whether that was an error in mechanical or software design, or a decision by someone less conservative wasn't mentioned that I recall.

One reason for not building a new plane was to avoid expensive training for the new type, which meant that they couldn't make the apparent behavior of the plane too different. Thus the decision to have MCAS work in the background, with only minor indications for the pilot.  Boeing said this was too avoid complicating the pilots job.

It was decided to make those indicators **optional** at point of sale, I don't know if this was done by marketing without talking to engineering or not, but in my opinion, this was the worst error. At least one of the airlines involved decided to save $8,000 per plane by not installing it.

21357,"You can downvote all you like, but the preliminary report on the crash confirms everything I posted. The news media is claiming the crew followed the FAA directive, but that is not the case. The crew failed to trim the aircraft before cutting power to the stab trim motor, then when they realized moving the trim wheel by hand is difficult while holding pressure on the control column, they reapplied power to the trim motor and allowed MCAS to trim nose down again. The directive says to trim the aircraft using electric trim, then cut power to the trim motor for the remainder of the flight to prevent further MCAS-commanded trim movement. The crew did neither.

21358,"I'm going to assume you're not a pilot, because you don't know what you're talking about. MCAS moves the stabilizer trim 2.5 degrees in 9.5 seconds, which means unless the pilot does something to stop it, the 10"" trim wheel right next to his knee will rapidly spin nose-down for 9.5 seconds, something that would be impossible for an experienced pilot to ignore. Further, moving the stabilizer trim results in an immediate difference in yoke force (the amount of force the pilot is applying to the yoke), so even if the trim wheel weren't spinning away--for nearly ten seconds--the pilot would immediately know that he is applying ever harder yoke force to maintain desired pitch. 

Assuming the system functions as Boeing claims, all the pilot would have to do is trim nose up using the yoke-mounted switch, which deactivates MCAS, then disconnect the electric trim motor when the aircraft is in trim to prevent reactivation of MCAS. At that point the pilot would simply manually trim the aircraft by turning the trim wheel for the remainder of the flight. This report that the pilots followed the procedures in the FAA directive are false. The directive explicitly says following an unwanted MCAS activation to use electric trim to return the aircraft to a trimmed condition, then to disconnect the electric trim motor and leave it disconnected for the remainder of the flight. This report says the pilots did neither of these. In fact, it says the pilots initially disconnected the electric trim motor BEFORE retrimming the aircraft, then reconnected the electric trim motor after they realized they could not move the trim wheel against opposite elevator. 

Again, assuming MCAS functions as Boeing claims, these pilots did not respond appropriately to an MCAS failure as directed by the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive. That means either they screwed the pooch, or MCAS does not function (or fail) as Boeing says it does. ",-0.026507936507936508,negative,Boeing Crisis,0.48674603174603176,negative

The IEEE guy that so many are quoting has never trained nor flown jets, especially not commercial airliners, and them flying a small single-engine piston plane doesn't in any way qualify them to comment about commercial airliners. As I've stated repeatedly, underwing engine placement creates an upward moment of rotation. This is the case for every airplane in the world with that engine placement. If you want to claim that that is a flaw, then you have to accept that every single plane every to have flown with underwing engine placement is flawed, with possibly the exception of high-wing aircraft. The only way to avoid having a rotational moment is to have the engines on the same plane as the CG of the plane. CG means Center of Gravity, it's the theoretical point where a plane would be balanced no matter its orientation. Any engine placement that puts the thrust centerline on a different plane than the CG creates a rotation moment.

The plane the author flies is piston-engined, with the engine on the front of the plane pulling through the plane's CG. The flight dynamics of what he knows how to fly are completely, totally different than large jets.

The problems with the Max's automatic trim system were caused by bad design decisions in hardware and software, and those errors were driven by the desire to not have to get a new type certificate for the plane that would require expensive retraining and certification for pilots. The errors were allowed by the FAA's decision to allow plane manufacturers to self-certify their planes.

In certain circumstances wind flutter interaction with the AOA probes could cause intermittent compliance flags to the MCAS system causing nose down overtrim. Due to the transient nature of the signals the stall redundancy routine would not be triggered (transient signals of under 10-15ms), which would otherwise cross reference other flight parameters for validation, so a single point of failure became possible through the AOA probe, leading to progressive nose down trimming with no associated stall or comparator warnings. Only when the nose down trim reaches the stops does the stick shaker and associated stall cacophony come on, causing utter confusion as airspeed is progressively increasing, pitch falling, STAB TRIM is fully nose down, and any nose up elevator input seemingly produces no effect due to the massive stabilizer force. Seeing how the MCAS architecture wan't briefed to pilots, the massively confusing and contradictory warnings, the response to such a situation, especially in high workload phases of flight can easily lead to the unfortunate events we saw in Indonesia and now Ethiopia.

And to talk of Russia annexing Crimea when they founded a naval base there over 200 years ago. 

Sevastopol was founded in June 1783 as a base for a naval squadron under the name Akhtiar[10] (White Cliff),[11] by Rear Admiral Thomas MacKenzie (Foma Fomich Makenzi), a native Scot in Russian service; soon after Russia annexed the Crimean Khanate. Five years earlier, Alexander Suvorov ordered that earthworks be erected along the harbour and Russian troops be placed there. In February 1784, Catherine the Great ordered Grigory Potemkin to build a fortress there and call it Sevastopol. The realisation of the initial building plans fell to Captain Fyodor Ushakov who in 1788 was named commander of the port and of the Black Sea squadron.[12] It became an important naval base and later a commercial seaport. In 1797, under an edict issued by Emperor Paul I, the military stronghold was again renamed to Akhtiar. Finally, on 29 April (10 May), 1826, the Senate returned the city's name to Sevastopol.

22696,"That is so much hyperbole.  All MCAS is an automatic adjustment to the trim system in the event it detects too high an angle of attack, which can cause a stall.  

When designing the MAX jets, Boeing had to accommodate the new fuel-efficient engines, which are larger than their predecessors.    To give them adequate ground clearance, they had to move them forward on the wing so they could move them up.  That adjusted the way the aircraft handled, making it easier to let the angle of attack get out of control when turning.  

To counteract that effect, MCAS raises the trim (think the rear set of wings on the tail, they actually move slightly as a unit) to keep the aircraft from having too high an angle of attack.  

The procedure for disconnecting the automatic trim control is unchanged from prior models.  Pilots moving to the MAX should know how to disable it.  In the Lion Air crash, maintenance logs indicate that the angle of attack sensor was faulty, and Lion Air failed to correct it.  

We still don't know if it was a factor in the Ethiopia crash.  They had trouble early on, and MCAS does not function with flaps deployed (which should have been deployed at that phase of flight).  The first officer also apparently had only around 200 hours of flight experience, which is crazy low for a commercial pilot.  I would not be surprised is MCAS was little to no factor in the crash.

In certain circumstances wind flutter interaction with the AOA probes could cause intermittent compliance flags to the MCAS system causing nose down overtrim. Due to the transient nature of the signals the stall redundancy routine would not be triggered (transient signals of under 10-15ms), which would otherwise cross reference other flight parameters for validation, so a single point of failure became possible through the AOA probe, leading to progressive nose down trimming with no associated stall or comparator warnings. Only when the nose down trim reaches the stops does the stick shaker and associated stall cacophony come on, causing utter confusion as airspeed is progressively increasing, pitch falling, STAB TRIM is fully nose down, and any nose up elevator input seemingly produces no effect due to the massive stabilizer force. Seeing how the MCAS architecture wan't briefed to pilots, the massively confusing and contradictory warnings, the response to such a situation, especially in high workload phases of flight can easily lead to the unfortunate events we saw in Indonesia and now Ethiopia.

Because most of the news is reporting that Boeing didn't even alert pilots to the fact that there was an MCAS system that would override their controls in the event of a possible stall.

You also cannot conclude that ""shoddy maintenance"" is to blame (especially without actual news citations).  The news sites are reporting that the crash was due to the inter-operation of the MCAS and AOA sensors.

23430,"Boeing can just fuck off with this narrative, ""Oh it's just a software bug.""  It's not.

First off, the *basic* problem was the redesign of the plane.  Airbus got ahead of Boeing, so Boeing rushed this design through.  New engines, moved wings, different aerodynamics.  They *could've* continued with the redesign, but they wanted to get to market.  Instead of spending time and money with a proper design, they decided to hack it.

So they have these sensors that tell the angle of the plane, two of them on each plane.  Problem: there's a known issue where the sensors sometimes report the wrong data.

They decide to ""fix"" the aerodynamics issue with a software patch - but the decision-making process is given information by a potentially-faulty sensor.  Also, for some reason, they design the software to only poll data from one sensor, not both.

Now, there's another level of engineering that'll help catch the sensor/software issue - but Boeing decides to sell it as an ""upgrade"" to the plane.  US airlines opt for the upgrade, many third-world companies don't.

There's pilot training that will let the pilots know this issue exists, but Boeing decides not to include that information in the training they're offering for the new planes.

So now you have not-properly-trained pilots lacking safety equipment ""upgrades"".  That training and those ""upgrades"" would help prevent a potential safety issue arising from poorly designed software - but the basic safety issue is caused by engineering redesigns and rushing to market.

So Boeing can just fuck off with this ""oh, it's just a software bug"" narrative.  It's *not* just a software bug.  It's poor engineering design, a rush to market, bad computer/hardware interface, a decision that certain safety items are ""optional"", and the desire to avoid changing their training too much.

>>On Apr 4th 2019 The Aviation Herald received a video to demonstrate, how long it takes to trim from full nose down (trim position 0 units) to a normal trim setting (around about 5 units) via manual trim: the captain needed about 30 seconds to get the trim back into normal range and reported being tired afterwards, the first officer tried and failed needing one minute for one unit and then being exhausted. The source added: ""This video was taken on a parked B738 which is the same physical centre console system as the B38M. The importance was to demonstrate how acutely aware crews must be of their Stab Trim position. In the case of ET302, with the trim passing 2.8 Units towards 0 due to suspected MCAS faults, with aerodynamic loads by increased relative wind, it is even more demanding, time and energy consuming and thus dangerous to recognise a mis-trim too late. In case of low level flight or severe CFIT (controlled flight into terrain) risk, the outcome is predictable.""

There's no such thing as a PE in aerospace; it works differently and it's actually better. Also, it's not just for software, but all aerospace.

You don't just trust one guy that passed a certification a long time ago. Nobody can sign alone on safety aspects; all justifications are defined, realized, and accepted by multiple people of different responsibilities and who each have an independently-approved delegation of signature (that is very limited to their role, and they don't keep when they change jobs), under the oversight of the authorities. 

Actually in many countries, there's no concept of a PE in other industries either. It works the same as aero, with the authorities emitting regulations and certifying the products instead of distributing lifelong rights to approve anything.

Obviously something went wrong here, but I don't work for Boeing and we don't know enough to point to a root cause in the certification process. But saying it would be better if the industry stopped doing certification by the authorities and trust some guys who got certified earlier in their career is uninformed.

It appears that the fundamental problem at Boeing is management as the problems are far wider than the single class of aircraft .  Boeing is far behind on delivery of Air Force Tankers, The tanker is essentially an adaption of an existing airplane to the tanker role.  About 7 years after the initial deal was approved ( and then rescinded due to corruption ) Obama awarded the contract to Boeing over Northrop/Airbus.  Eight + years later (and 20 years after the tankers were moved to a high priority project)  the project is still a disaster. To put it in perspective  we went from first US orbital flight to landing a man on the moon in half the time.  But the problem is not isolated with the 777 or Tanker, Boeing is in trouble on several other projects.  
including a new heavy lift rocket engine . 

Sometime in the next decade students at the Harvard Business School's Business Policy class will be looking back on Boeing's changed culture as the foundation of the problems.  The separation of management from engineering and flight testing, managers working to meet Wall Street's expectations rather than building a great product at a competitive price.  Many stories of engineers and managers being told by HQ  to make something work within the budget  or they would find someone who would.

In certain circumstances wind flutter interaction with the AOA probes could cause intermittent compliance flags to the MCAS system causing nose down overtrim. Due to the transient nature of the signals the stall redundancy routine would not be triggered (transient signals of under 10-15ms), which would otherwise cross reference other flight parameters for validation, so a single point of failure became possible through the AOA probe, leading to progressive nose down trimming with no associated stall or comparator warnings. Only when the nose down trim reaches the stops does the stick shaker and associated stall cacophony come on, causing utter confusion as airspeed is progressively increasing, pitch falling, STAB TRIM is fully nose down, and any nose up elevator input seemingly produces no effect due to the massive stabilizer force. Seeing how the MCAS architecture wan't briefed to pilots, the massively confusing and contradictory warnings, the response to such a situation, especially in high workload phases of flight can easily lead to the unfortunate events we saw in Indonesia and now Ethiopia.

The max 9 is longer and heavier than the max 8 but with the same braking ability. Since the plane is fuel efficient and designed for longer flights, the plane is normally very heavy at take off. This means that the runway has to be quite long, and realistically a low altitude to meet the necessary rejected take off parameters. This limited its use drastically and therefore a lot of orders were converted to the max 8.

On this flight the pilots had put a shitload of bobbleheads, drinking birds and other executive toys all over the cockpit. 

Anyway, one of the airlines senior pilots was on board. Now normally they tell the crew when they are on board, so they behave themselves. This guy was apparently a bit of a dick so not only had he not told them, but he had ordered the stewardesses & ground crew not to. And he had a common name so it didn't stick out on the manifest (not like pilots actually read those things, apart from total passengers and weight of luggage). 

So to get back to the moral. He wandered into the cockpit and saw all this shit, including one of those Garfields that you stuck onto a car rear window stuck to the one of the side windows. He totally flipped his lid and gave them the bollocking of a lifetime. It would have made a drill sergeant proud.

25280,"Like toomuchoink said, 3 systems lowers the chance of failure. I thought I’d add some numbers to that example for you.

Let’s say a system will fail 1% of the time (which is a very high failure rate for critical equipment). You’d expect the system to fail 1% of the time, 1 out of every 100 flights.

Now let’s look at one redundancy, which is two systems in total. If neither system fails or if only one fails, you’re okay. If both fail, you’ll crash. We still expect the first system to fail 1% of the time. The second system will fail 1% of the time the first system fails, or 1% of 1%. We’d expect the plane to crash 0.01% of the time, 1 out of every 10,000 flights.

Similarly, a system with two redundancies will crash 1% of 1% of 1% of all flights. We’d expect the plane to crash 0.0001% of the time, 1 out of 1,000,000 flights.

Further, a properly designed system will create an alert every time the first system fails. The next time the plane lands, they should take it out of commission and repair it so that there are always 3 systems operational.

Lastly, I said that 1% is a high failure rate. A 0.1% failure rate in a system with 2 redundancies would be expected to crash 1 out of every 1,000,000,000 flights.",-0.1465057471264368,negative,Boeing Crisis,0.4267471264367816,negative

> Boeing's 737 MAX, the model being flown by Indonesia's Lion Air that crashed last October killing all 189 on board, had been criticized for relying on a single sensor to detect the aircraft's angle of attack, according to today's Wall Street Journal. A preliminary investigation by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) blamed the stall prevention system (known as Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS) which relied on a the single sensor that provided erroneous data, causing the MCAS to misfire, leading to a series of events that put the plane into a nosedive.

25860,"> Mcas, a system designed to prevent a very rare event

I've heard a bunch of variants of this comment from posters in various forums, and several of those people were being accused of being obvious Boeing shills by others. I personally doubt there's an active misinformation campaign, it's more like excuses being made by employees for their company's shitty decision making.

The rub is this: MCAS is designed to counter a *rare event*, but is predicated upon the correct operation of a sensor, and the problem is that *sensor failures are not that rare*. 

Mathematically, the apologetic argument is this:

**p(mcas activation)** = probability of MCAS activation = some low number

**p(mcas failure)** = probability of MCAS failure = some low number

**p(death from mcas)** = **p(mcas activation)** × **p(mcas failure)** = super low number, why worry about it?

Meanwhile, the reality is:

**p(death from mcas)** = **p(mcas activation)** × **p(mcas failure)** + **p(AoA sensor failure)**

Where the p(AoA sensor failure) is actually reasonably high. In one forum an Airbus engineer recalled an incident where 2 of 3 AoA sensors agreed on a false reading, because they had both iced over and got stuck at the same angle! This is why this problem won't just magically go away, and Boeing can't just release a software fix quickly. A life-and-death decision is being made on an unreliable information source, and if it goes wrong (which it will), then recovery can be physically impossible for the pilots.

That alone is bad for pilots in an emergency but the weight adds to it if there is a failure as the nose will constantly drift up due to the weight offset.

I repeat though, non balanced planes are probably fine for military, because you can bail out, but for passenger planes, not a good idea especially when that system relies on one sensor and one single point of failure.

26402,">The previous lion air flight to the one that crashed had a pilot on it that knew exactly what was going on and shut down the system responsible. Its lack of training.

This lie has been told so many times by clowns on reddit, some people are starting to believe it. The extra pilot on the previous flight who prevented the crash **did not have more training**. He was a junior officer with only a couple hundred hours, who had never flown a 737. The pilot in charge when the plane crashed had 6,000+ hours, including on that very 737 plane.

The fact that this junior pilot prevented the crash had **nothing to do with training**. He prevented the crash because he wasn't actually flying the plane, he was sitting behind the pilots in the jump seat as a passenger. Because he was farther from the controls, he had a wider field of vision, and therefore spotted the trim wheel spinning down by the pilot's knee. He therefore conjectured it might be a problem with the trim, and suggested that they power off the trim motor. Which fixed the problem and prevented the crash.

The pilots did not notice the spinning trim wheel because they were busy trying to keep the plane's nose up and preventing it from diving into the sea. Their attention was on the stick and on forward controls, not down on a wheel by their knee.

Imagine you're driving a car at 200 mph and it's pointed straight at a tree. You try to turn the steering wheel to avoid the tree, but the wheel keeps turning back and points it straight back at the tree. You have literally 2-3 seconds before it hits. What the hell are you going to do? Take a leisurely look around to see what else might be wrong, or try to avoid the tree?

This is exactly what happened in the crash. The black box shows that the pilot was pulling on the stick with all his strength trying to point the nose up, but MCAS was pushing the nose down into the sea. MCAS won, and the plane crashed. It was at an altitude of 3,000 feet, less than 2-3 seconds from crashing. Not enough time to do anything else except try to point the plane away from the sea.

How is this not bad design, when **the only visual indication that MCAS has taken over is an intermittently spinning wheel down by your knee**? How much extra work would it have taken to put an indicator up on the console, in the pilot's field of vision? A blinking light? A verbal warning? Any damn thing at all?

Remember, 6 pilots failed to see that stupid spinning wheel. Two pilots and co-pilots on the planes that crashed, plus pilot and co-pilot on the plane that almost crashed. The only person who saw it was a junior officer who wasn't actually doing anything, who wasn't fighting the controls, who was sitting way back behind the pilots and had the time to look down and notice a spinning wheel.

This is what this guy is calling ""experience"". That's not experience, that's luck.

The reason why all this shit happened in the first place is because **Boeing didn't want to talk about MCAS**. They failed to mention MCAS even once in the one-hour iPad presentation, which was all the training new pilots got for this plane. The plane's manual mentions MCAS once in the index, but there is no description in the text. Nothing to say what it is, what it does.

Boeing did this because MCAS is really a piece of software that is designed to make the new 737 feel like the old 737 during flight. It's a selling point that Boeing can tell airlines - look, our new plane flies just like the old one, you won't even have to spend extra on pilot training, think of how much money you'll save!

This is why Boeing didn't like talking about MCAS. Because MCAS was a reminder that the planes aren't the same, it's just this fancy piece of software that tries to fool the pilots into thinking they're the same. And an imperfect piece of software that crashes two planes when it fails.

26655,"So here's the thing. Boeing took a 1960's airframe and tried to shoe horn 2010's engines onto it.  

The design of the airframe prevents the landing gear from being lengthened to accommodate the larger diameter engines.  To maintain clearance under the engines they mounted them further forward and higher on the wings.  This causes the pitch moment of the aircraft to change such that it has a tendency to drive itself into a stall.   To counteract this tendency, they installed a software system to push the nose of the airplane down in the event of a stall. That system uses a single potentially faulty sensor to determine whether it should plunge the nose of the aircraft down. 

So what we have is an airframe designed for 1960's engines that's had engines larger than it can handle bodged onto it. To stop an inherently unsafe behavior introduced by this hack, they built incomplete software that's now killed hundreds of people.

The littlest ones of things that could have make the miss the flight, is what was their opportunity to save family on the plane, hence they see it as their responsibility or make it their responsibility afterwards.

Obviously, there is no way of knowing this would happen, and until it is clear what caused the explosion/crash, no one is at fault, certainly not any passengers, but that is not how it works right after you barely survive a plane crash.

Also, there is a high chance these people go into a depressive state, maybe as part of (""abnormal"") grief pattern and in both such cases you see misplaced guilt because they feel bad and start thinking badly about themselves and then blaming themselves for things, even if they did not cause/influence it.

This is reminiscent of the problem with Patent law in the US, especially big Pharma: to foster creativity and new products, the government guarantees a competition free environment for a period, which often time results in price gouging (which we have seen in HIV drug seen Epi Pens recently). So the government tries to regulate that aspect which curtails free market even further. Bad cycle made worse every time a consumer gets ripped off bc Congress pretends to care and changes something else (when we all know nothing changes bc Congress has it's hands in the pockets of big corporations).

Trump seriously comes across (and likely is) totally oblivious to politics, in particular - foreign politics and trade deals.

He thinks he can just be a bully, because he was raised as a 'Boss', is a total fucking narcissist and I'm fairly sure he still believes in *The Art of the Deal* without irony.

I just don't understand why you (Americans) allowed this fucking clown to become your president. I'm sorry that probably offends a good deal of you, especially it is probably a lot less relevant to those from the USA active on this particular sub. But seriously - it's not just the amount of Americans that actually voted for Trump - but more disconcerting is the amount of Americans who chose to **not** exercise their voting right at all.

Voting is compulsary in Australia - not that everyone votes, just because something is law, it doesn't literally force people to do it. But we still have a pretty complete turn-out for our major elections.

She cheated out the real candidate for the Left; Bernie - from even being in the running.

She's a fucking self-centred shit and I hold her responsible for at the very least, denying America - the World even - a chance at Trump NOT being the fucking **POTUS** - even now, I have to reality check (pinch myself, so to speak) whenever I seriously wrap my head around that joke of a man being the fucking president of the USA.

It seems like everyone is guilty:

> The decision follows a ruling last September when the WTO determined that the EU had failed to comply with a demand to remove subsidies or void their effect on Airbus. Aircraft-subsidy battles can take years to work their way through the regulatory process. The U.S.-European spat goes back 40 years. The two sides settled a previous dispute over subsidies in 1992, but the U.S. walked away from that deal in 2004, arguing Airbus had an unfair advantage, and brought a case before the WTO.

> Boeing also is challenging aid Bombardier has received. In April, the company filed a petition with the U.S. Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission alleging Canadian state subsidies created an unfair competitive threat to its own 737 passenger jets. The commission voted Friday to press ahead with the case in the face of protests from the Canadian government.

31473,"He's not wrong, but as usual it's not the whole story. The actual story has a bit of background.

Boeing was doing illegal stuff in the late 90's/early 2000's. A lot of this revolves around a much earlier version of the tanker contract. Ultimately, Boeing hired an Air Force acquisition staffer after she illegally helped Boeing secure the original tanker contract. When this was discovered, the sole-source contract was cancelled and the contract was opened up to international competitors, in a program known as KC-X.

KC-X was another long story. The USAF had a specific set of requirements laid out. Boeing's offer met these requirements almost exactly, whereas Airbus's offer had a higher capacity, but was substantially larger, heavier, and more expensive. The USAF selected Airbus's offer, and it's widely speculated in the industry that this was done *specifically* to spite Boeing for their illegal activities on the earlier contract.

Boeing then complained to the Government Accountability Office, saying that their KC-767 met the Air Force's specifications better than Airbus's KC-30, and the GAO agreed with Boeing. Boeing was not *awarded* the contract, but the competition was thrown out and rebid.

It's important to note here; Government contracts are very, very specific in what they require and how those requirements are to be met, from a performance perspective. Boeing's argument was essentially ""You asked us to build a specific aircraft. Airbus built a different aircraft than what was specified, and was selected. This is not fair."" Boeing's argument was that, if the higher capacity aircraft was requested originally, they would have offered a platform that met those requirements. Again, based on the way government contracts are run, the GAO agreed with Boeing.

The entire contract was redone *again,* and Airbus eventually pulled out stating that it unfairly favored Boeing.  It is pretty commonplace in the industry to state that the competition unfairly favors your competitors every time you pull out of one though. It's one of the weird things in the industry.

Northrop recently stopped development of their T-X prototype, stating that the competition was unfairly slanted to their competitors, Boeing cancelled their protest of the B-21 contract, stating that it the competition was unfair, etc etc.

Bombardier cannot deliver street cars on time, Toronto ordered 55 of them for 2015, lowered to 27 and then 14, still not delivered.

In London they completely failed on a train signalling contract and were kicked off the project. They were accused of incompetence and misrepresentation. They severely underbid the project and couldn't get it done, the replacement contractor cost more than 2x their bid (sound familiar?).

The company is 54% owned by a single family, 5 of which sit on the board of directors. What do they do after a $1B bailout, needed because they couldn't keep the C series planes on schedule or budget? Well how about a 50% pay raise for senior management (at least 1 family member included), isn't it nice when incompetence is rewarded?

""But the bailout will save jobs"" they say, as the company gives executives bonuses and lays off 2,000+ Canadians / 14,000+ around the world.

The hypocrisy of our government (conservative and liberal) is also a frustrating. Apparently Bombardier deserves bailouts, but not Blackberry? Apparently the US needs to allow in our planes, but we ban their cheap dairy? Boeing can't complain about Bombardier's pricing, but Brazil can take it's C-series pricing complaint to WTO without a peep?

I work in the aviation industry and I have long followed the development of the 3 new airframes that are attempting to take market share from the 737 and A320. The C Series was in considerable trouble and needed the [Quebec government to buy 49.5%](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bombardier-quebec-formalize-1-billion-c-series-deal/article30570998/?service=amp) of the program. The Canadian government [added some low interest loans to help finish the project](https://globalnews.ca/news/3354398/bombardier-trudeau-hammered/). It is very clear that the program had considerable assistance from the government. The C Series then struggled with sales, as is common in the industry for new products. To gain market share they sold the planes for far below the cost of production. I have read that it is clear that the input parts are more expensive than the price offered by Bombardier. The planes were offered to an international customer, Delta, at that price. My understanding is that Delta is domestic to Boeing, so Boeing can set their prices however they would like, but Bombardier has to follow US import law.

Early on in being President his advisers were people like Cheney, Rumsfeld, Libby and co, who were interested in invading Iraq before 9/11 even happened.

Bush was a terrible President, but he was also surrounded by people who gave him *really* bad advice, and he just listened to it.

You should read some threads from the neutral politics and history sections about his Presidency.

There's no escaping that George Bush Jr is one of the worst Presidents ever (he **easily** cracks the top 5) but between his advisers and his former CIA director and President dad who never finished the job in the Middle East, George Bush Jr had a lot pushing him in a certain direction.

His efforts in Africa alone keep him from being the worst President, and his post-President work (while some consider it to be a ploy for the media) are definitely more indicative of him being someone who didn't go into politics with the intention to do bad things.

Bill Clinton and Al Gore also believed Saddam to have had WMD's and considered it to be a very serious threat. It's not an uncommon opinion that a war would have happened either way under a Gore or McCain administration, and since both Gore & McCain both believed Iraq to be a place that needed to be neutralized due to Saddam, it's an entirely possible that the same war takes place.

The US bombed Iraq before 9/11 even happened as a response to the fear of Saddam having WMD's.

Mostly wrong. The pilots did not know about MCAS specifically, but they did know that a runaway trim was happening.

First, the fact that at least two situations occurred in which MCAS was activated erroneously within the first few months of service shows that the rarity of angle of attack sensor failures cannot be relied on to prevent this from happening. That leaves us with pilots. As far as we know, the score between pilots and MCAS is 1-2. Pilots are supposed to know how to deal with a runaway trim, but these ones still failed, and we know of only one who succeeded (against MCAS specifically). So as a backup system the pilots clearly were not sufficiently effective. Where does that leave us? With 346 dead passengers and crew. I've studied countless aviation accidents and it's sadly common for tragedies to result in situations where the pilots are the last line of defense. We can go on all day about how there _should_ have been enough redundancy, but the fact that two crashes occurred within such a short period tells us, in hindsight, that this was false.

(edit) I'm adding a more thorough explanation of the implications of what I just said in terms of blame. There is no question about it; everyone agrees MCAS was a poorly designed system. And ultimately some fault lies with the pilots (and in the LionAir crash, with LionAir). The controversy is over how much. The way I see it, MCAS was a disaster waiting to happen, and blaming pilots is counterproductive. An individual angle of attack sensor is unlikely to fail, but that probability has to be multiplied by the number of angle of attack sensors in service on MAX 8s and the time that they're used for. Once you add all this up, it's likely that a few such failures will occur in any given timeframe, even though those events were individually unlikely. An angle of attack failure, if it occurs during certain phases of flight, has a relatively high chance of triggering MCAS. Based on these factors, the chance that MCAS could be erroneously triggered over the course of, say, a year, is probably near certain. So designing MCAS this way all but guarantees that eventually a pilot will have to deal with an MCAS-related runaway stab trim. Now, I like to say that 50% of pilots are below average; this is always true and always has been. Where Boeing failed is in imagination: they decided that because pilots are trained to handle runaway trim scenarios, an MCAS failure wouldn't be a problem. Oh, if only that were true! At some point, one of those failures was going to occur while a crappy pilot was in control, and then it's game over. You can now look back through the chain and see that the moment MCAS was implemented, a disaster at some point during the service life of the aircraft was virtually certain.",-0.0776216931216931,negative,Boeing Crisis,0.46118915343915345,negative

As I mentioned. Lion Air sent up a known broken plane. There weren't two critical failures due to failures being more common than expected but because one of them was sent up already broken. If you design a backup plan that is only expected to be needed 1 in 100,000 hours but has to be employed *on every flight* because of a failing airline, then the plane looks worse than iit actually is.

> As far as we know, the score between pilots and MCAS is 0-2.

That's definitely not true. We know that the pilot flying Lion Air flight before the crash cut out MCAS and flew the rest of the flight. We know this because the pilot reported it. And because the pilot left MCAS cut out (both switches in cutout) as the plane was parked on the tarmac between flights.

The airline had plenty of reports that that plane was broken. Given the issues, safety regs require that they not send the plane up with passengers in it again until it is proven that it is fixed. Instead they just replaced a part (there is some question they even did that) and sent it up on another flight where it was discovered that whatever was  done didn't fix the problem.

The passenger deaths in the Lion Air crash were due to the airline failing to take the plane out of service. And due to the pilots not refusing to fly a plane which had not been properly taken out of service due to the myriad reports of problems.

> So as a backup system they pilots clearly not sufficiently effective.

That is a different argument. You've moved the goalposts. Before you said that pilot training is not part of any safe flight. Now you are changing your position to say that pilot training isn't sufficient in this case. I agree with this position.

I actually have a long and (IMHO) excellent post on this I made quite a while ago. But I can't find it. I can't search my post history. I should gild myself long enough to find it.

Part of that post is something to this effect:

To bring the plane back in trim after MCAS puts it far out of trim requires knowing how to manually trim a plane against aerodynamic forces. This is something all pilots should know, as you learn it when you begin flying as a private pilot. But despite this it's clear that many commercial pilots don't know how. I personally believe this is because the flight procedures Boeing put into place were created when this plane was created. And that was 50 years ago. At that time most commercial pilots previously had flown planes with manual trim. Perhaps over Korea or in WWII. But now much later that's just not the case anymore. And Boeing failed to examine their procedures and revise them for this current reality.

Imagine we are talking about truck drivers. If I made a truck which didn't have ABS and I said ""Surely you know how to drive a vehicle without ABS, it's how we all started out. Just do it like that."" then I'd be a fool. 50 years ago I could say that, everyone started out that way. Now I can't do that, because reality is current drivers started out on cars with ABS. They've always had ABS.

Boeing has to revise the procedures for the reality that pilots cannot be expected to know how to manually bring a far out of trim plane back into trim with just manual trim. This might mean different training. Although personally I feel that it should mean revising the plane such that the automatic trims can be cut off while leaving the power trim switch on the yoke working. Either way, this is a failure of Boeing even if it is due to a deficiency of pilots.

I don't disagree that there was criminal negligence on Lion Air's part. I'm talking about the pilots.

I also don't think I was moving the goal posts. I claimed that pilot training was essentially a band aid, and I justified this by explaining that relying on pilots, trained or not, is not a foolproof strategy. I obviously don't mean to argue that better pilot training doesn't help.

If the Lion Air crash were the only MCAS-related crash, this would make sense. But there was no known fault with the AoA sensor on Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 until the accident flight. So from a holistic viewpoint, the fact that LionAir was negligent has no bearing on whether or not the design of MCAS deserves the lion's share of the blame, because a second crash occurred even without negligence changing the failure rate (that we know of).

34066,"> I also don't think I was moving the goal posts. I claimed that pilot training was essentially a band aid, and I justified this by explaining that relying on pilots, trained or not, is not a foolproof strategy. I obviously don't mean to argue that better pilot training isn't necessary.

It's not a band-aid. And nothing is ever foolproof. Aviation acknowledges this. Again, you have to have systems in place to reduce the chance of a deadly outcome to an acceptable value (1 in 100M if I recall correctly). These systems might include pilots, they might not. The primary system might not involve the pilot, but if it is a critical system and it has a failure chance over a certain level it must have a backup system. If that backup system still has too large a chance of failure it must also have a backup system. This happens until you get to a backup system which a sufficiently small chance of failure. If no such backup system can do that, then the instructions for the last backup say ""and land at the nearest opportunity"" since continued flight is not safe.

Pilots are part of many, many of these systems. There is nothing wrong with the pilots being part of these systems even though such systems are not foolproof.

So I'm not sure what message you got from me, maybe I expressed my message poorly. My message is this.

Previously you said that any system which involves the pilot is insufficient. This is completely wrong. It's wrong according to the FAA. It's wrong according to other non-FAA aviation practices. Thus you are wrong to say this.

When you say that in this case, the training may not have been sufficient, then we apparently disagree less. I feel the safety systems in place were insufficient. There were several ways to fix them, but Boeing, through oversight did not do so. Add in a primary system with bad software and you're looking at a significant failure on Boeing's part.

> If the Lion Air crash were the only MCAS-related crash, this would make sense. But there was no known fault with the AoA sensor on Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 until the accident flight.

You need to read closer. Agreed, there was no known fault with the AoA sensor on Ethiopian. But there being one on Lion Air changes things completely.

As I expressed before, the chance of two failures due to a ""1 in 100,000 item"" becomes a lot more likely if one of them isn't really 1 in 100,000. If I said I'll bet you $10 that I can guess the number what will come up on this 100 sided die on two consecutive rolls and if I win you give me $20,000, you'd say yes. Because my chances of doing this are 1 in 100 squared, or 1 in 10,000. But if then after we made the bet I said ""actually, on the first roll I'm going to roll the die first, look at it and then guess the number"". You would then say ""that's not right, the odds have changed"" because now I will certainly get 1 of them right. So I have a 1 in 100 chance of getting $20,000 from you. I only have to ""beat the odds"" once, not twice.

This is the same situation, except instead of the payout changing, the odds are changing. Because one of the two crashes as due to a 1 in 1 failure, the actual odds of the failure occurring in flight don't have to be nearly as common to explain both crashes as it would be if both just naturally occurred. So when you say the failures must be far outside what Boeing expected to reasonably explain these two crashes you are making a false statement from your poor understanding of how the probabilities work in this case.

I explained this twice now. Do you understand it now or are you going to go forward with more statements from your lack of understanding? Are you going to say things like ""you have to add up all the chances of failure"" without seeing that your estimation of the chances is based upon flawed data?

> Can we attack the argument and not me please?

That is attacking the argument. It is not ad hominem to indicate a person's argument is poor because they are not in a good position to make it. Suggesting that the argument is poor because the person behind it isn't well informed is completely valid. If you don't like the insinuation, then get informed before you make false statements.

This would be wrong, but fortunately it's not what I meant. Sorry if my wording was unclear. I don't think we disagree on this; my initial reply was to the guy who started the comment thread, who stated ""pilot training deserves most of the blame."" That is the statement I disagree with.

> When you say that in this case, the training may not have been sufficient

This is much closer to what I meant. I only meant to state that pilot training was not an adequate line of defense in this particular case.

This is correct, but I'm not talking about the odds of two crashes happening; I'm talking about the odds of any crash happening, since one crash is still one crash too many. Therefore on one occasion within the first year and a half of service we got to the second failure level without a (known) latent failure on the first level. This was my point.

There are some things in there which are wrong. The AoA indication situation is different than we understood at the time. But Boeing did leave it off on planes which were supposed to have it (Southwest paid extra to have it and still didn't get it!). 

Also the two switches didn't work exactly the way I say in there on the NG. But regardless the switches should be changed so that opening one switch turns off only the computer-initiated power trim (AP, auto and MCAS) and opening both turns off all power trim. I also no longer have confidence the FAA will require this. But they should. And now that other agencies will be looking into the plane instead of abdicating their qualification responsibilities I would hope one of the others holds Boeing this even if the FAA does not.
