Right. First, you would choose to believe this 'information' referenced as fact, yet if you really look at the reported ""evidence"", there are far more questions than answers.

*Especially*, considering all the parties involved (and potentially), and the questionable evidence presented, one rule of thumb is ""don't believe anyone"". They're all liars until absolute fact can be established.

How is it that in so many other 'global-class' events, investigation for the facts takes months, if not years, yet we're ""concluded"" about who did what so fast the smoke hasn't cleared from the scene of attack?

58,"Trump/Israel/Saudis became interested in keeping the status quo, once they implemented sanctions.  Let me be clear.

Trump/Israel/Saudis weren't satisfied with the Iran Deal, because Iran was using the funds to wage proxy wars in Syria/Yemen/Iraq against Saudi/Israeli/American interests.  So, Israel/Saudis supported Trump, and helped him get elected.

Once Trump changed the status quo to Iran being Crippled by Sanctions... The Saudis/Israelis/Trump became satisfied with the Status Quo that currently exists.  War is not something the Saudis/Israelis/USA are interested in, because it gives Iran a chance to change the status quo in their favor.

Similarly, Iran was satisfied with the Status Quo of the Iran deal.  Once Trump got rid of the deal, and instituted Sanctions, Iran stopped being okay with the Status Quo.

So, now the USA/Saudis/Israel are satisfied with the way things are.  As long as Iran can't draw them into a war, Iran will slowly be strangled, and become less and less powerful(which will turn the tides of the whole middle east).  

Iran, knowing this, is doing ANYTHING IT CAN to change the status quo.  Because Europe wouldn't capitulate to Iran's demands of giving them a better deal, to make up for the USA leaving the deal... Iran has no diplomatic options, besides coming back to the table, and taking a worse deal.  Iran isn't willing to do that.

Article 36 of the JCPOA

> If Iran believed that any or all of the E3/EU+3 were not meeting their commitments under this JCPOA, Iran could refer the issue to the Joint Commission for resolution; similarly, if any of the E3/EU+3 believed that Iran was not meeting its commitments under this JCPOA, any of the E3/EU+3 could do the same. The Joint Commission would have 15 days to resolve the issue, unless the time period was extended by consensus. After Joint Commission consideration, any participant could refer the issue to Ministers of Foreign Affairs, if it believed the compliance issue had not been resolved. Ministers would have 15 days to resolve the issue, unless the time period was extended by consensus. After Joint Commission consideration – in parallel with (or in lieu of) review at the Ministerial level - either the complaining participant or the participant whose performance is in question could request that the issue be considered by an Advisory Board, which would consist of three members (one each appointed by the participants in the dispute and a third independent member). The Advisory Board should provide a non-binding opinion on the compliance issue within 15 days. If, after this 30-day process the issue is not resolved, the Joint Commission would consider the opinion of the Advisory Board for no more than 5 days in order to resolve the issue. **If the issue still has not been resolved to the satisfaction of the complaining participant, and if the complaining participant deems the issue to constitute significant nonperformance, then that participant could treat the unresolved issue as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part and/or notify the UN Security Council that it believes the issue constitutes significant non-performance.**

Europe and the US have both failed to live up to their commitments, the issue has not yet been resolved and its been a lot longer than 15 days. There is a clear case of significant non-performance on Europe and Americas behalf. Iran has not seen any of the benefits that were promised as part of the deal. Therefore, Iran is within its rights to drop its commitments in whole or in part, while still remaining in the JCPOA. Iran has chosen to only cease its commitments in part, and has stated it is willing to re-commit once the other parties begin complying with the deal themselves.",0.08480861244019139,positive,Iran Sanctions

1) Im not actually sure specifically what you mean here. Who would could pay more than we can? Why would they pay the cost to export etc when demand domestically would be plenty high. If worse came to worse we would just outlaw exporting crude oil again. 

2) Again im not sure what this sentence means. We would still be able to fuel ships etc and companies would procure fuel on the global market if we could not.

We’re already getting dangerously close to having the West completely ostracize us, and this now is borderline suicide.  
... or perhaps this, being far from a fluke, is another of our administration’s calculated politically-correct (not in the current left-right dynamics sense, but in the original, Communist-speak sense) moves to snub the West and kiss up to the Chinese Central Government, at the cost of the city’s continued prosperity and its citizens’ livelihoods, freedom, and security. 

It has only gotten worse since the newish Chief Executive came into power. First by ceding areas in the West Kowloon High-Speed Rail station over to Chinese customs and jurisdiction, then by ousting The VP of the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in HK and threatening to discontinue leasing their current premises to them, among other things; and now we have this. 

I kid you not. “If” – scratch that, make it “when” – we are finished with metamorphosing into “just another coastal Chinese city”, you can be sure that it will not be owing to anyone’s folly, “patriotic” fervor, nor misjudgment – it will be by design, of those in control and those above them even. And we can do jack diddly, as our poor excuse of a “democracy” is a farce.",-0.05446428571428571,negative,Iran Sanctions

From 1996 Congress provided funding, though not always sufficient amounts. Consequently, some of the agreed transitional oil supplies were delivered late.

736,"So the strategy Obama and the rest of the world wanted to take with Iran was to make a deal that would essentially deradicalize Iran and end their possible need to create nuclear weapons. 

The terms placed on Iran were that they would have to seriously reduce their nuclear energy program (which was thought to also include a nuclear weapons program) to the point that it's insurable and allow inspectors from the IAEA full rights to regularly inspect all of Iran to ensure no nuclear materials were being create and no weapons program existed. In exchange, the US and all other members of the agreement, would lift sanctions and allow companies to invest in Iran's economy. 

The plan was that, over the course of the 20 or so years the deal would apply, Iran would economically develop and integrate with the world economy in such a way that going for nukes would be unecessary and counter productive. At the same time, this would deradicalize the country by showing that the West is not evil and can be reasoned with, which was part of the platform that their current moderate president was running on. 

Since the deal has been signed, Iran has complied with everything its asked for and no inspectors have discovered any increases in their nuclear energy stockpiles or any weapons program. 

The problem now with Trump bringing back the sanctions is that it's essentially proving the radicals in Iran right--that the US cannot be trusted and is out to get them. It was a real watershed moment when the  moderates won with a positive view of the West. So placing sanctions on for no reason completely ruined everything the moderates there succeeded in achieving and basically guarantees that the radicals in Iran will win future  elections because they benefit from America being the bad guy. 

Additionally, despite the fact that the US didn't officially ratify the agreement through Congress, all other countries in the agreement essentially see this as the US going back on their word and undermining the deal they spent years negotiating to create. Some are even circumventing the US's decision, like China and the EU, because of how valuable they think the deal is and how stupid the US is being. So the fact that the US is basically undermining their interests on Trump's whim to fuck everything Obama means these other countries have less of an interest in cooperating with the US again in the future.

So all the sanctions do is actively prevent Iran's economy from improving, which further radicalizes them, and piss off Europe and the rest of the permanent members of the UN Security Council. ",-0.0171309872922776,negative,Iran Sanctions

Cuba has arguably one of the richest democratic processes of all of our civilized nations. They dont spy on their people. What they do is keep privately owned media out so that bs propaganda doesnt infiltrate the minds of their young. One could argue that state controlled media is a form of oppression, but if we look at our own media, they are own by the same 6 entities thanks to the telecommunications act under Bill Clinton's presidency. These 6 entities control everything in our media and they are closely aligned with out oligarchic overloards' interests. Further, one could look at the unfortunate moment in history when Socialist Chilean president allowed media to be wholly free (libre) and it  was used to spew lies and incredibly shady/false propaganda against him and his party which aided in the coup against him on september 11, 1973.

Your definition of ""jurisdiction"" doesn't make sense. A court is part of the judicial branch of the government. This means that they're the ones deciding the punishment. It's the executive branch of the government that enforces that punishment.

If having the power to enforce the punishment is part of the definition of jurisdiction, then a court could never have jurisdiction over a case because a court doesn't have the power to punish anyone. This means according to you it can only be a government that has jurisdiction, because only a government has both judicial and executive branch.

All you're doing is trying to twist the meaning of ""jurisdiction"", just google the definition of it and you'll realize that literally none of them talk about any enforcement.

The ICJ has jurisdiction over the case and this is a fact. You're trying to use semantics to change the meaning of a word in order to say that the ICJ doesn't have ""jurisdiction"" over the case, which doesn't make sense at all. I don't understand what your goal is in this discussion?

This is the most detailed definition I've found:

> Power or right of a legal or political agency to exercise its authority over a person, subject matter, or territory. Jurisdiction over a person relates to the authority to try him or her as a defendant. Jurisdiction over a subject matter relates to authority derived from the country's constitution or laws to consider a particular case. Jurisdiction over a territory relates to the geographic area over which a court has the authority to decide cases. Concurrent jurisdiction exists where two courts have simultaneous responsibility for the same case. [Source](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/jurisdiction.html)

Country A can make whatever laws it wants with regards to it's own markets.

I constantly see this hypocritical stance taken by Russia and China, that make enormous internal regulations and punitive actions not against just coporations, but entire countries that recognize Taiwan, or individuals that visit with the Dalai Lama.

For instance the Russian federation requires all data for Russian citizens the world over to be first installed on Russian servers. This means any Russian citizen, operating in any country, anywhere.

Their mechanism for enforcing this is taking punitive action towards companies that do not follow these data retention policies when they operate within the Russian federation.

My company rightfully follows this data retention policy with respect to Russian citizens, because we want to operate in Russia.

My point is sanctions are just market based regulations and penalties, and other countries are capable of (and do) levy similar regulations and penalties on U.S companies in their own markets based on their own internal laws, and have the right and sovereignty to do so.

Yes, knowlage of one is important for the other, but no nation has devloped nuclear bombs from nuclear power plants. All nations that have both have started with nuclear weapons and then made use of it to produce energy.

All nuclear experts agree that it is pretty dumb and useless to use modern nuclear power plants to produce weapons materials. No nation has ever taken that path and no nation will. If you want nuclear materials then making a plan to take it out of commercial reactor that is monitored is about the dumbest possible plan.

Iran had been willing to buy these reactors from France and France would have had full view of the whole fuel cycle in order to make sure that this was not used for anything else. Iran was at that time and since also abserved under the NPT. If there was still any credible worry, for a deal with the US Iran would have adopted the extend protocol as well (as they latter did in the Obama deal).

Under this arrangment Iran would not even have devloped the capability to make weapons grade materials but the US of course blocked it anyway.

Please learn something about the history of Iran and Israel. For the most part the nations were frindly for a long time, even until the late 1980. We do actually have data about public opinion and the Iranian people don't have a really strong opinion on Israel, far less then Arabs. Most experts also agree that the Iranian elites as a whole are not perticularly anti-semitic. There is not really a true idiological thread, depending on the politics of the day the play the thread up and down on both sides. 

Ahmadinejad is guy with a big mouth that was put foreward by the regimn to scare the west and make the west think that Iran is crazy. He said stupid and crazy stuff for the same reason Trump says stupid stuff. Its simple populist politics. 

> So there you go, a government which recently developed high-range missiles, and who wants to ""wipe Israel off the face of the map,"" is in perfect position to do so if they are allowed to use nuclear power without the plutonium being collected.

Please learn how nukes work. You can't simply stick the plutonium from the reactor waste stream on a bomb and fire it. It requires a siginifacnt amount of further work that is very difficult to hide. Also, all these materials would be continuly monitored by the IAEA.

Also, Saudi Arabia has said they would take the war into Iran. If you think Iran is not allowed to have missiles because of what they said, why are the Saudis allowed?

Iran need missiles for defense, as has been proven in the Iran-Iraq war where they were hit by missiles and were unable to do anything. This included chemical gas attacks on civilian.

How can you argue that they don't have a credible argument for defensive missile threat when they are surounded by powers, some hostile, who all have these missiles. 

> Israel has behaved responsibly with their nuclear weapons. They have not threatened to wipe anyone off the face of the map. It's completely different.

The have not threatend anybody because they have not admited offically that they have them. However the implicit thread is totally clear.

Having secret nuclear weapons is totally against the spirit of the international community and ever nation other then Israel would face sanction and pushback.

Iran is a shitty regime but they keep largely to themselves. Saudi Arabia on the other hand is exporting its brand of violent wahabism everywhere from the ME to west Asia, Africa, Oceania, Europe. Not so much in USA.

Personally I have always been baffled at that relation between US and SA. It has stayed cordial throughout the years even though SA has been actively funding many groups and terrorists ennemies to US and , like I said, had probably a hand in 9/11 as well.

Very true. There is good reason to go to college, but many in my generation are flawed in allowing or persuading their children to go to school for something that won't produce income after graduation. Also, allowing their kids to go to school in places they simply can't afford while there *are* affordable options out there. The other aspect is that many parents don't see the problems in their kids early enough to know that places like UF have a 41% dropout rate. College has become a finishing school/half way house for the real world for lazy parenting. 

> Problem is, kids don't find this out until after they've paid $30k for a degree and have little job prospects.

Very true again.. Well, that is the average millennial debt, but the actual college debt is a much higher sub set. 

> However, your assertion that ""9/10 choose to put themselves in debt"" is silly

Is it? Credit card debt, student loans, car payments and home mortgages are the top categories for millennials being in debt.. actually, that sort of the same for previous generations, different order sometimes, but same categories. 

The average millennial makes $35,000 a year? (Was surprised by this). So, at some point, someone either didn't do the math to figure out they can't afford that car, that college, that x,y,z or ignored the fact for a later day.

Anecdotally, I mentioned UF earlier; I visited my daughter there several times. I was amazed by the amount of high end stores, restaurants, apartments in the area. Couldn't help but think, there's no way a college kid could afford to eat or shop at these places.. but everywhere we went, we were the only parents and the rest was college students paying with credit cards. I often viewed my daughters facebook/instagram and see her friends that she grew up with going everywhere on Gods green earth on holiday.. I ask, how can they afford this, I know their parents, they can't afford that?? Is it credit cards? Nope, I was told, it's student loan money; what doesn't get used for school ends up back in the students bank account.. so and so actually put a big chunk of his student loan overage on an A4.. Again, anecdotally, but I am sure there are some stats out there about college costs vs. student loan debt that would show this is a larger problem. And don't forget, millennial's biggest debt is credit cards and at the same time, half of that subset are college oriented

I guess where this whole conversation is going is what to do.. there are several cultural things (better guidance by parents, teachers) that need to change, for sure, that would prevent a lot of millennial debt. There are things that the government should do to step in (outlaw predatory practices) and things they shouldn't do.. Largely, the fact that tuition is so high is due to government backed loans (different conversation), it's never good to ask the government for help.

What I see here is there are bad **decisions** by both parents and students on top of predatory practices by student loan and credit card companies. But I will always say this is a personal responsibility. Society cannot be responsible for your decisions, you are.. just as you are responsible for getting yourself out of the situations you put yourself in. When I hear conversations about millennial's having high debt, unable to pay it off, I worry the next part of the conversation is what leftists have already started which is - debt forgiveness. What they really mean is higher taxes or shifting it to our national debt.

1454,"I think the most frustrating thing for a lot of sub-median income is this assumption that they aren't ""living within their means"". Heck, even for people who make fairly high above the median income. Average millennial makes $35k: take out taxes (15% = ~$5K roughly), rent ($7-10K/year if you're near any big city for a basic room), food ($2k/year), and then health insurance (variable). That leaves you with 10-15K/year, if everything goes perfect, for anything else including: a car/car payments & insurance, any incidentals, any accidents or bad luck, gas, etc. At the end of the day, there's little room to pay off any student loan debt or credit card debt. A lot of people find themselves in similar situations post-grad, and if they don't have Mom or Dad to help them out by living at home or whatever, it's going to take forever to pay off $20-100K+ of debt at a 6% annual interest rate. 

But I don't blame these people. Yes, there is probably a large group of people that just poorly managed their money in college/post-grad and were financially irresponsible. But from what I've seen, it's mostly the kids of parents from the middle class who find themselves in this situation. Rich enough help their kid out in college and encourage them to get a good education because they think it will lead to better things, but not rich enough to fully support their tuition costs. And no school counselor, parent, or teacher ever really told these kids exactly what they would face if they went for that art, literature, science, etc degree. And how could you expect a 16-17 y.o. to know that on their own? It's the system and the older generation that is initially failing these kids and putting them in a tough spot to begin with. How they handle it afterwards it up to them though. 

On top of that, tuition has been rising at criminal rates the last 2 decades, far outpacing inflation and damn near everything else. This only leads to an ever increasing problem. As to what to about student loan debt? There's not really a good answer. I think free/subsidized higher education would be nice, but we would need a socialistic system that worked at a grander, more organized scale. Which will likely never happen in the US. I think loan forgiveness is probably our best bet unless we regulate tuition prices, but instead of handing out loan forgiveness like candy, use it to encourage professionals to work in underprivileged/developing areas. That will further boost the economy of those areas and allow them to grow into larger populations. 

Sorry for the long post, but my two cents. I agree with you that you're responsible for your decisions, however, I hope you can agree with me that expecting high school kids to plan their financial future is slightly absurd. That burden should fall on society (i.e. parents, school systems, colleges themselves, etc.) to make kids aware of the risks and cost/benefit of their choices. Which they don't.

 Also, anecdotally for me: going to UGA, which I would consider similar to UF as a large, state college. Most people swiping their credit cards left and right are almost always using their parents accounts. There are ample amounts of kids from well-to-do families at those big state, college footballs schools.

Financial institutions are always quite attentive to the risks of working with other companies, especially if the risks concern legal and regulatory compliance. In this case, the allegation is that certain US financial institutions were lied to by Huawei (and Wanzhou Meng personally) about the nature of Huawei's dealings with Iran.

Contrary to common reporting, it is not a violation of US sanctions to do business in Iran in many areas (including consumer telecommunications), nor is it a violation of US sanctions to do business with another non-US business that does business in Iran in non-sanctioned areas. US sanctions are mostly in the nuclear, weapons, oil, transport and financial industries -- but there is a complex web of different laws, regulations and executive orders which makes the whole thing difficult to sort through at best. The added complexity of making sure that a company's activities strictly fall outside the bounds of the sanctions (and the risk of violating them, even inadvertently), has put off many companies from doing any business with Iran as a blanket rule, as Iran is a small enough market that the benefits do not outweigh the costs and the risks.

Huawei sought funding from US institutions. When those institutions asked about Huawei's businesses in Iran, they were allegedly lied to. Had they known the truth, they may well not have entered into those financial transactions, because ensuring compliance with the sanctions is risky and cumbersome. Thus, Huawei's dealings with those financial institutions were fradulent, according to the allegations.

Though politically, this might seem like the US is just trying to block Huawei's expansion by any means possible, the simple fact is that (if the allegations are true), Huawei chose to do business in Iran, knew that also doing business with American companies at the same time would be a headache, and then tried to cover up its Iranian dealings.

Not really. The EU is mostly feckless and cannot provide for it's own security. It's also becoming weaker on the world stage and in six months is set to lose 20% of it's GDP overnight.

This data is ancient. Since Trump announced that US sanctions would resume the Iranian economy has completely tanked. The rial is next to worthless. Thousands of small businesses have been forced to close and there have been massive layoffs in every major economic sector.

These all pretty much revolve around Osama Bassnan, who had worked for the Saudi government and received money from a Saudi Prince multiple times. Bassnan and his wife gave money to two of the hijackers. The House of Saud has 15,000 members and 2,000 of those hold power and wealth. One guy giving money to a guy that then gave money to the hijackers isn't concrete evidence of Saudi involvement. People having other people's phone numbers isn't evidence either.

>In early 2004, Bill Clinton quietly agreed to help the Saudi Arabian ruling family in their revolting attempts to rehab the Kingdom's besmirched image.  Once considered a strong American ally, **Saudi Arabia was widely condemned after shocking revelations about the role of Saudi nationals in implementing and financing 9/11**. The kingdom needed a new look, a new brand.

But none of that bothered Bill Clinton. Not at all. Business is business and he saw the large piggy bank that was waiting at the end of the expansive Arabian Desert.

>According to Joe Conason's new book, ""Man of the World,"" Bill Clinton accepted the invitation of the **then Crown Prince, now King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, who offered his jet to bring Clinton and an entourage of dozens of his cronies to Saudi Arabia.** Amr al-Dabbagh, a Saudi businessman joined in the invitation, which included featuring Clinton at the Jeddh Economic Forum, where **Clinton's appearance could easily be interpreted as an imprimatur of the Kingdom, whether he wanted it to be or not.**

[The 9-11 Families Have Standing and Sue Saudi Arabia - The US Government has Protected the Saudis For Far Too Long](https://trofire.com/2017/03/22/911-families-sue-saudi-arabia-us-government-protected-saudis-far-long/)

>The families of 9/11 victims will finally have their day in court, as a lawsuit filed Monday seeks to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for their role in the attacks, despite the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations’ all-too-cozy relationship with the Saudi government. The suit says that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA),

>*“raised, laundered and paid substantial financial support to al Qaeda to fund its budget and terrorist activities, including the preparation and execution of the September 11th Attacks [… and] actively supported al Qaeda in its final preparations for the September 11th Attacks through a network of the Kingdom’s officer, employees and/or agents who met with and aided the hijackers.”*

>New York local news outlet, PIX11 reported on the details of the suit, saying that Saudi officials supported two hijackers in the 18-months leading up to September 11, 2001:

>*“The officials allegedly helped them find apartments, learn English and obtain credit cards and cash. The documents state that the officials helped them learn how to blend into the American landscape.”*

>The suit even goes on to show that a Saudi official was in the same Virginia hotel with some of the hijackers the night before the attacks. The Saudis in power sought to fund and support the attacks in an attempt to gain support from religious fundamentalists in the kingdom, according to the lawsuit, using evidence from the FBI’s investigation into the 9/11 attacks.

>The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhatten by Kreindler & Kreindler, an aviation law firm, and lays out how Saudi royals funneled funds to Osama bin Laden through terrorist-friendly charities. Attorney Jim Kreindler told PIX11: “The charities were alter egos of the Saudi government.”

>The suit was recently made possible by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), which was passed in September of 2016. President Obama vetoed the bill only to see the Senate vote 97-1 to override the President’s authority and pass the bill anyway. In his veto, Obama said that the bill would “create complications in our relationships with even our closest partners.” Shamefully, the President was likely worried that we may upset one of our key petroleum and weapons trade partners.

>As the bill was being passed, DTN pointed to the economy as Obama’s reasoning behind his veto:

>*“Estimates put the figure of official Saudi assets in the government at somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion when considering potential foreign bank deposits and offshore accounts.*

>The kingdom had $96.5 billion in holdings of Treasury securities in August, according to the most recent number released by the Treasury Department. Saudi Arabia ranked 15th in its holdings of U.S. Treasury debt.”

>General Electric, Dow Chemical, Boeing, Chevron, as well as several firms hired directly by Saudi Arabia lobbied against the bill, putting business interests before justice.

>While the 9/11 families are battling Saudi Arabia in court, the Saudi government is now funding a devious PR campaign to dupe US veterans into protesting JASTA in Washington, DC. Ring of Fire reported on the dastardly plan earlier in March. Qorvis MSLGROUP, a PR firm operated by the Saudi Arabian government, has recruited veterans to travel to Washington, DC – paying for dinners, drinks, and a stay in the plush Trump International Hotel – in a ploy to have the veterans pressure Congress to gut JASTA. The veterans are falsely told that JASTA could open up individual American soldiers to lawsuits for their acts in military actions. “JASTA poses no risk of exposing U.S. service members to lawsuits in foreign courts. JASTA deals only with the immunity of foreign states, not individuals,” according to William S. Dodge, an international law expert and law professor at UC-Davis.

>The fight over JASTA and the lawsuit against the Saudi government risk upsetting an uncomfortably cozy relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia. The relationship was developed during the 1973 oil crisis and fostered under George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Bush sought to keep the oil flowing between the United States and Saudi Arabia, even after 9/11, while Obama sold over $115 billion in weapons to the kingdom during his administration.

>Hall of Fame Trial Lawyer and television and radio host Mike Papantonio says that it is shameful that the wishes of the Saudi government have been placed before the needs of the 9/11 victims:

>*“The love relationship between the Saudis and the US government has got to take a back seat in uncovering the truth about the Saudi involvement in the mass murder of 3,000 Americans on American soil. Both Bush and Obama have protected their Saudi pals for far too long.”*

>James Riches, a retired firefighter that lost his son in the attacks, echoed those sentiments in an interview with Pix11, “The Obama and Bush administrations have done nothing but fight the 9/11 families for 15 years. The United States government took the side of the Saudis over the 9/11 families.”

>Following in the footsteps of his predecessors, President Trump recently approved a multi-million dollar deal to send even more arms to the kingdom. The same deal was halted by President Obama last year, after more than 60 lawmakers from House of Representatives opposed the deal, citing human rights violations and possible war crimes committed by Saudi Arabia in their attacks against Yemini rebels. Trump had previously spoken out against the Saudi government for their role in 9/11, but it seems that oil and money have pushed aside his concerns.

>In addition to political hurdles, the victims’ families are gearing up for a long and arduous legal battle over the lawsuit. The firm bringing the suit says in a statement:

>*“The KSA will fight the case very hard.  We anticipate its lawyers will challenge JASTA on Constitutional grounds and will seek to dismiss the case alleging that there is not sufficient evidence that it bears responsibility for the 9/11 attacks. […] [W]e we must convince the court that the KSA provided material support to al Qaeda and we face a well-funded and determined foe.”*

Googling ""Obama all options on the table"" brings up many, many more.

Please tell me you're joking with that second source.  It does not state that snapback sanctions were forced on Obama by Congress.  It very clearly states that Obama opposed Congress implementing additional sanctions (that is, in addition to anything proposed in the deal as well as in addition to any currently in effect).  Republicans wants to impose more sanctions for the same reason they sent a letter to Iran, political points with an important international issue.  

The snapback provision has been conceived by the Western powers involved in the negotiations and supported by the US negotiating team.  This was not something pushed on them by Republicans who think they're more important than they are.  

The real issue is whether Russia and China will accept that, as they traditionally oppose such automatic measures.  The US (Obama) wants the sanctions to snap back without having to deal with a Security Council veto.  I believe some progress has been made on this front in recent discussions.

You're not letting any future failure speak for itself, you're speaking for it right now and posting bogus sources as support, in addition to wildly inaccurate statements about the intentions of the US and European powers.

The Obama administration knows that it's illegal to launch a war without Congress approval, unless it's just about drones and torture and that type of stuff, which it can do without anyone's approval (see Somalia, Libya...). But a full scale war... you need Congress for that. Hey, Lieberman! You crazy war mongering fuck, come here you!

Everyone knows sanctions won't do anything to stop Iran from developing nukes if they want to. That's not the point. The point is that Israel has nukes, the US has them, Russia, Pakistan, North Korea... hell, my aunt has nukes. No one's crazy enough to actually use them, it's only a tool for regional control. And yes, Iran wants to control the region. So does everyone, including the US, which is, strangely enough, thousands of miles away from the region. And Israel already controls the region, but they get to, because their skin is pale enough not to be evil.

2553,"> Noam Chomsky once said that the greatest threat the the USA and her allies imposed by Iran having nukes, would be Iran's ability to have a deterrent to US aggression in the region.

That's completely wrong though. A deterrent means having enough nukes that you are guaranteed the ability to retaliate after a first strike. Deterrents are stabilising forces. You need a lot of nukes to have a viable deterrent. This is something the US and USSR had in the 80's and 90's. 

Unfortunately Iran is not able to afford that many nukes. Neither is North Korea. Now North Korea has China to back them up and artillery which threatens Seoul. So the US is not going to attack them.

However Iran is different. They are in transition state to having a small number of nukes which would be a lethal threat to Israel in a first strike. However those nukes are still somewhat vulnerable to an Israeli or US first strike. You probably can't destroy their nuclear program because it is too dispersed. However once they have their small ICBM stock you can destroy that on the ground if they look like they will use it. And you can shoot down the ones you miss with missile defence.

So Iranian ICBMs are not a deterrent. All it would take is Ahmadinejad to mouth off sufficiently for Israel to consider an Iranian first strike to be a possibility and I'd expect an Israeli first strike.

Basically Iran is slowly (and very ostentatiously) building a knife and taking it to a gunfight.

> Kids this is not a black and white situation- do not be provoked into labelling an enemy so easily.

I'd quite agree. Not all nuclear arsenals are the same. Big ones act as strategic stabilisers. Small ones are destabilising.

Interestingly the USSR had a dangerously small arsenal in the 50's - a dozen or so land based ICBMs and no subs. And, not surprisingly, there were people in the US who advocated a first strike to destroy it.

Two additional soldiers, believed to have been killed outright or mortally wounded, were taken by Hezbollah to Lebanon.[32][33][34] Five more were killed in a failed rescue attempt. Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery fire on targets in Lebanon that damaged Lebanese civilian infrastructure, including Beirut's Rafic Hariri International Airport,[35] an air and naval blockade,[36] and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah then launched more rockets into northern Israel and engaged the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in guerrilla warfare from hardened positions.[37]

The main thing you are missing is that oil production isn't anywhere near ""maxed out"". If oil rises in price, producers will produce more because 1) their profits will be greater, and 2) the marginal cost of producing oil in some places (mostly in the Americas and Asia) will be overcome by the increased price. 

Middle East oil is the cheapest to produce, so item 2) is irrelevant for it. The only thing Iran considers to maximize its profit is price, and the sanctions (whether we like them or not) have dropped the price Iran can sell its oil for due to a limited market. In fact, other oil producers like the price increase from a drop in effective supply. But prices don't get crazy high because more producers come online as it makes sense for them to. And Iran gets the shaft because they can't get the going rate for their exports because their selling options are limited and they are forced to sell at a discount. The sanctions really have isolated the effect on Iran; that some countries in Asia get around the embargo was fully expected and doesn't mean it hasn't had a significant impact on Iran.

The real winners are the other countries that produce oil, and those that get Iran's oil at a discount. The real loser is Iran, or any country that becomes addicted to Middle East oil as a result of the temporary discount on Iran's oil. And the rest of the world is relatively unaffected.

Who told you this?  They are lying.  Refiners are going bankrupt because the Naphtha market is taking a heavy hit now that Natural gas is so cheap.

Do you comprehend what Fungible means?  It means that 'Iranian' in Iranian Crude means bupkiss.  Crude oil is essentially a fungible commodity.  Iran competes on an international market.  If Iranian supply to India is reduced, India will buy other sources of crude on the spot market.

The Green movement in Iran opposes these sanctions because they're ultimately going to benefit the ruling mullahs as they work to turn the population even further against the U.S. and their poverty-inducing sanctions.

You say it was a mistranslation but ask any Persian and they will tell you their president is a fucking mad man. 

I actually feel bad for the Persian people more then anything but if sanctions are a means to pressure their government to cooperate and improve foreign relations then I much prefer that instead of military action. I actually hope the people overthrow the current fucks at the top because I haven't heard a Persian person have one good thing to say about any of them.

Should I here ask - ""What is your definition of 'at times'?"" 

Should I here note while AIPAC and other Jewish lobbying groups are ""common knowledge"", which by no means of the proper definition (or my own understanding of the definition) of conspiracy does a group being known commonly exclude a group from being considered conspiratorial - if that's what the group is. Also, does this mean there are no Jewish groups not commonly known? Does this mean these not commonly known Jewish groups, if they exist, would not commit any conspiracies?

The attempt to troll as well as the argument you offer seem rather blunted as well as slightly insulting to those of insulted by poor arguments.

That argument - 'because AIPAC and other groups are known AIPAC and other groups cannot conspire'.

>Based on intelligence estimates at the commencement of hostilities, American leaders expected the tide of the war to quickly shift in Israel's favor, and that Arab armies would be completely defeated within 72 to 96 hours. On October 6, Secretary of State Kissinger convened the National Security Council's official crisis management group, the Washington Special Actions Group, which debated whether the U.S. should supply additional arms to Israel. High-ranking representatives of the Defense and State Departments opposed such a move. Kissinger was the sole dissenter; he said that if the U.S. refused aid, Israel would have little incentive to conform to American views in postwar diplomacy. Kissinger argued the sending of U.S. aid might cause Israel to moderate its territorial claims, but this thesis raised a protracted debate whether U.S. aid was likely to make it more accommodating or more intransigent toward the Arab world.

>

>.

>By October 8, Israel had encountered military difficulties on both fronts. In the Sinai, Israeli efforts to break through Egyptian lines with armor had been thwarted, and while Israel had contained and begun to turn back the Syrian advance, Syrian forces were still overlooking the Jordan River and their air defense systems were inflicting a high toll on Israeli planes. It became clear by October 9 that no quick reversal in Israel's favor would occur and that IDF losses were unexpectedly high.

>During the night of October 8–9, an alarmed Dayan told Meir that ""this is the end of the third temple."" He was warning of Israel's impending total defeat, but ""Temple"" was also the code word for nuclear weapons. Dayan again raised the nuclear topic in a cabinet meeting, warning that the country was approaching a point of ""last resort"". That night Meir authorized the assembly of thirteen 20-kiloton-of-TNT (84 TJ) tactical atomic weapons for Jericho missiles at Sdot Micha Airbase, and F-4 aircraft at Tel Nof Airbase, for use against Syrian and Egyptian targets. They would be used if absolutely necessary to prevent total defeat, but the preparation was done in an easily detectable way, likely as a signal to the United States. Kissinger learned of the nuclear alert on the morning of October 9. That day, President Nixon ordered the commencement of Operation Nickel Grass, an American airlift to replace all of Israel's material losses. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Kissinger told Sadat that the reason for the U.S. airlift was that the Israelis were close to ""going nuclear"". European countries refused to allow U.S. airplanes carrying supplies for Israel to refuel at their bases, fearing an Arab oil embargo, with the exception of Portugal and the Netherlands. Portugal permitted the United States to use a leased base in Azores, and the defence minister of the Netherlands, apparently acting without consulting his cabinet colleagues, secretly authorised the use of Dutch airfields.

>

>Israel began receiving supplies via U.S. Air Force cargo airplanes on October 14, although some equipment had arrived on planes from Israel's national airline El Al before this date. By that time, the IDF had advanced deep into Syria and was mounting a largely successful invasion of the Egyptian mainland from the Sinai, but had taken severe material losses. According to Abraham Rabinovich, ""while the American airlift of supplies did not immediately replace Israel's losses in equipment, it did allow Israel to expend what it did have more freely"".  ...

This tells the Iranians they can treat the negotiations with as much contempt as they have so far with total impunity.

Don't get me wrong - I think the negotiations are a waste of time even with sanctions. In fact I'd call them off and keep the current EU/US sanctions. The odds are that Iran will nuclearise anyhow. Still they will only have a few dozen rather primitive ICBMs in the near future. These could be shot down with missile defence and in any case the regime could be deterred.

In the long run I think the only solution is to promote regime change within Iran. Invading is out of the question but the student movement seems to be slowly eating away at the regime all on its own. I'd provide vocal support for this and donate money whilst treating the current regime as illegitimate. I.e. follow the game plan with Eastern European communist regimes. Any action taken should be agreed with Iranian opposition people though.

Once the regime goes I'd negotiate with great fanfare - E.g. the Secretary of State flying to Iran and then the new Iranian President visiting Washington to meet with the POTUS. At this point I'd offer and end to sanctions in return for getting rid of the nukes. Also the US could unblock Iran's access to international trade and offer to buy up weapons grade material at above market prices.

The best case would be that a democratic Iran would disarm voluntarily like South Africa did. The worst case is that they'd not have missiles on hair trigger alert and maybe be a 'silent' nuclear power like Israel or Japan. Still if they're democratic it's likely that they would stop targeting the US and eventually reach a modus vivendi with Israel.",0.008548447437336326,positive,Iran Sanctions

  The main problem with the plant, that of the fuel supply, had been solved and the doubts whether the plant would start operation had already been removed, he said, adding that ""Russians are trying to accelerate the process and hundreds of Iranian engineers who have been trained in Russia are replacing Russian experts.""
