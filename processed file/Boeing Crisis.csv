"Boeing’s profits more than halved in the last three months as the company struggled to recover from two fatal crashes of its top-selling 737 Max aircraft and current trade disputes took their toll.The company, which still expects the troubled 737 Max jet to return to service by the end of the year, also said it plans to cut production of its wide-bodied 787 Dreamliner, a move that reflects the effect of global trade tensions.The company said slowed production of the Max will cost an additional $900m on top of $2.7bn loss of income already anticipated. Overall revenue for the quarter dropped 20% – less than investors feared. Boeing shares, which have dropped 20% since the Max was grounded in March, rose 3%.The drop in profits comes as Boeing announced that Kevin McAllister, head of its commercial jetliner division, is leaving the company after just three years at the job.McAllister’s exit comes less than two weeks after chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, who is scheduled to testify before Congress next week, was stripped of the company’s chairmanship.Muilenburg’s demotion followed a further hit to Boeing’s reputation for safety last week when published messages between two test pilots showed that Boeing knew about problems with the 737 Max’s MCAS anti-stall system three years before the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killing 189 and 157 respectively.The exchanges contradict Boeing’s previous position that it had no idea the system was unsafe. In the messages from 2016, simulator pilot Mark Forkner complained MCAS was acting unpredictably. “It’s running rampant,” he said.Separately, aviation authorities in Indonesia have briefed family members on their findings about the crash of Lion Air flight 610 before the release of the final accident report on Friday.Investigators from the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee in Jakarta said systemic design flaws in the 737 Max were compounded by errors by the plane’s pilots, who had not been sufficiently instructed on how to handle MCAS malfunctions.",Boeing profits fall by more than half as 737 Max scandal swirls,2019-10-23/17:39:26,boeing s profits more than halved in the last three months as the company struggled to recover from two fatal crashes of its top selling  max aircraft and current trade disputes took their toll the company which still expects the troubled  max jet to return to service by the end of the year also said it plans to cut production of its wide bodied  dreamliner a move that reflects the effect of global trade tensions the company said slowed production of the max will cost an additional m on top of  bn loss of income already anticipated overall revenue for the quarter dropped  less than investors feared boeing shares which have dropped  since the max was grounded in march rose  the drop in profits comes as boeing announced that kevin mcallister head of its commercial jetliner division is leaving the company after just three years at the job mcallister s exit comes less than two weeks after chief executive dennis muilenburg who is scheduled to testify before congress next week was stripped of the company s chairmanship muilenburg s demotion followed a further hit to boeing s reputation for safety last week when published messages between two test pilots showed that boeing knew about problems with the  max s mcas anti stall system three years before the crashes in indonesia and ethiopia killing  and  respectively the exchanges contradict boeing s previous position that it had no idea the system was unsafe in the messages from  simulator pilot mark forkner complained mcas was acting unpredictably it s running rampant he said separately aviation authorities in indonesia have briefed family members on their findings about the crash of lion air flight  before the release of the final accident report on friday investigators from the indonesian national transportation safety committee in jakarta said systemic design flaws in the  max were compounded by errors by the plane s pilots who had not been sufficiently instructed on how to handle mcas malfunctions ,Boeing Crisis,0.40474394
"European air safety regulators have told their US counterpart they want more testing on fixes to the troubled 737 Max flight-control systems before the plane is cleared to re-enter service.According to the Wall Street Journal, the EU’s Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) told the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) it was not satisfied with demonstrations of the reconfigured safety systems on the planes, which were involved in two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.Boeing had initially scheduled the plane to re-enter service at the end of August but disagreements over software details, centered on how the plane’s dual flight-control computers are now intended to start working together, have put that date back to at least the end of November.The aim, according to the Journal, is to add redundancy by having both computers work simultaneously to eliminate potential problems stemming from computer chip malfunctions.The issue is separate from changes to the aircraft’s faulty Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) but related to an emergency procedure that can be used by pilots to address the plane’s system malfunctions.Over the past months, Boeing and regulators have agreed on software revisions to MCAS designed to scale back the power, and reduce the likelihood of the system kicking in and forcing the plane’s nose down.Last week Boeing’s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, said test pilots had completed more than 700 Max flights.“We are very confident in that software solution, and we are now just marching through the final steps on certifying that, so that everybody’s confident in the safety of the airplane,” he said at a public appearance in New York.The new issue was identified during tests in June when a test pilot found that the procedure took more time than was acceptable to execute.A spokesman for the aircraft maker said: “We continue to work with regulators on addressing their concerns and working through the process for certifying the 737 Max software and training updates and safely returning the airplane to service.”The latest problems for Boeing come as pilots for Southwest Airlines, one of the largest operators of the troubled jet, sued the company, claiming the grounding of the 737 Max jets with the loss of 30,000 scheduled flights has cost them more than $100m in pay.In court papers, Southwest’s pilots association accusing Boeing of lying when it said the planes were just as safe as their predecessors.“Our pilots should not be expected to take a significant and ever-expanding financial loss as a result of Boeing’s negligence,” Jon Weaks, the union’s president, said in a statement. In total, 387 737 Max flown by 60 airlines are grounded.Boeing’s stock has dropped 11% since the 737 Max was grounded in March, costing the company $27bn in market capitalization. Before the crashes, the plane accounted for nearly 70% of Boeing’s overall commercial aircraft deliveries, and 30% of its total operating profit.",Boeing 737 Max: European regulators insist on more testing of troubled plane,2019-10-08/16:19:52,european air safety regulators have told their us counterpart they want more testing on fixes to the troubled  max flight control systems before the plane is cleared to re enter service according to the wall street journal the eu s aviation safety agency easa told the federal aviation authority faa it was not satisfied with demonstrations of the reconfigured safety systems on the planes which were involved in two crashes in indonesia and ethiopia that killed  people boeing had initially scheduled the plane to re enter service at the end of august but disagreements over software details centered on how the plane s dual flight control computers are now intended to start working together have put that date back to at least the end of november the aim according to the journal is to add redundancy by having both computers work simultaneously to eliminate potential problems stemming from computer chip malfunctions the issue is separate from changes to the aircraft s faulty maneuvering characteristics augmentation system mcas but related to an emergency procedure that can be used by pilots to address the plane s system malfunctions over the past months boeing and regulators have agreed on software revisions to mcas designed to scale back the power and reduce the likelihood of the system kicking in and forcing the plane s nose down last week boeing s ceo dennis muilenburg said test pilots had completed more than  max flights we are very confident in that software solution and we are now just marching through the final steps on certifying that so that everybody s confident in the safety of the airplane he said at a public appearance in new york the new issue was identified during tests in june when a test pilot found that the procedure took more time than was acceptable to execute a spokesman for the aircraft maker said we continue to work with regulators on addressing their concerns and working through the process for certifying the  max software and training updates and safely returning the airplane to service the latest problems for boeing come as pilots for southwest airlines one of the largest operators of the troubled jet sued the company claiming the grounding of the  max jets with the loss of   scheduled flights has cost them more than m in pay in court papers southwest s pilots association accusing boeing of lying when it said the planes were just as safe as their predecessors our pilots should not be expected to take a significant and ever expanding financial loss as a result of boeing s negligence jon weaks the union s president said in a statement in total   max flown by  airlines are grounded boeing s stock has dropped  since the  max was grounded in march costing the company bn in market capitalization before the crashes the plane accounted for nearly  of boeing s overall commercial aircraft deliveries and  of its total operating profit ,Boeing Crisis,0.583218694
"The US is set to impose $7.5bn (£6.1bn) of tariffs on exports from the EU including scotch whisky, French wine and cheese and aircraft in retaliation for subsidies given to the aerospace group Airbus after a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling.The tariffs announced on Wednesday could come into effect as early as 18 October and represent a significant widening of the Trump administration’s trade dispute with the EU, adding to growing tensions in the world economy.The US trade representative’s office (USTRO) released a list of hundreds of European agricultural products that will be subject to a 25% tariff, including British woollen jumpers and pullovers. Cookies, salami, butter and yogurt from some countries will be affected, along with olives from France, Germany and Spain, EU-produced pork sausage and other pork products other than ham, and German coffee.The USTRO said it would “continually re-evaluate these tariffs based on our discussions with the EU” and expects to enter talks in a bid to resolve the dispute.Still some Italian foods – Parmesan, Reggiano, Romano and provolone cheese – were hit with tariffs as were Italian fruits, clams and yogurt. Also seeing new tariffs are German and British camera parts, industrial microwave ovens, printed books, sweet biscuits and waffles.The US has also imposed a 10% levy on EU-made airplanes that could hurt US airlines that have ordered billions of dollars of Airbus aircraft.Food importers in the US were dismayed by the move and said the levies would hurt the upcoming crucial Christmas sales period.“It looks pretty bad. They hit cheese hard,” said Ralph Hoffman, a vice president of the Cheese Importers Association of America.It comes as the global economy is already struggling with the effects of a trade war against China launched by the Trump administration. Stock markets worldwide sold off on Wednesday amid signs of an economic slowdown and worsening trade relations.The EU said on Wednesday it would retaliate if the US imposed tariffs. Cecilia Malmström, the EU commissioner for trade, issued a statement saying the EU had shared proposals on settling the dispute in July. She said: “Our readiness to find a fair settlement remains unchanged. But if the US decides to impose WTO-authorised countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than to do the same.”The WTO ruling is the latest blow in a 15-year battle between the European manufacturer and its US rival, Boeing over state aid given to the companies. Next year, the WTO is preparing to rule on what tariffs the EU can impose in retaliation to US state aid given to Boeing.The case, first brought in 2004, involved aid given to Airbus by EU nations for the development of its A380 superjumbo jet and the smaller A350. The US alleged that Airbus illegally received loans on preferential terms and billions of euros in grants. The WTO, which is tasked with settling trade disputes, gave a mixed verdict in 2010, which was followed by years of appeals.Boeing issued a statement blaming Airbus’s non-compliance with WTO rulings as the reason for the possible tariffs.A spokesman said: “Unfortunately, Airbus’s non-compliance will negatively impact European member states, industries, and businesses completely unrelated to Airbus’s actions, as well as Airbus’s airline customers. Yet even today, Airbus could still completely avoid these tariffs by coming into full compliance with its obligations. We hope it will finally do that.”Airbus said the imposition of tariffs would create insecurity and disruption to the aerospace industry and the broader global economy. The company called for a negotiated settlement.Guillaume Faury, Airbus’s chief executive, said: “Airbus will continue working with its US partners, customers and suppliers, to address all potential consequences of such tariffs that would be a barrier against free trade and would have a negative impact on not only the US airlines but also US jobs, suppliers, and air travellers.“Airbus is therefore hopeful that the US and the EU will agree to find a negotiated solution before creating serious damage to the aviation industry as well as to trade relations and the global economy.”Airbus and Boeing vie every year for the top position in the aircraft manufacturing and sales leagues. Boeing last year delivered 806 planes to customers, six more than Airbus.Boeing has endured one of the most difficult years in its history, after two crashes involving its 737 Max jet that killed 346 people following the apparent malfunction of safety features.",Scotch whisky and French wine hit by $7.5bn US tariffs,2019-10-03/00:30:05,the us is set to impose  bn  bn of tariffs on exports from the eu including scotch whisky french wine and cheese and aircraft in retaliation for subsidies given to the aerospace group airbus after a world trade organization wto ruling the tariffs announced on wednesday could come into effect as early as  october and represent a significant widening of the trump administration s trade dispute with the eu adding to growing tensions in the world economy the us trade representative s office ustro released a list of hundreds of european agricultural products that will be subject to a  tariff including british woollen jumpers and pullovers cookies salami butter and yogurt from some countries will be affected along with olives from france germany and spain eu produced pork sausage and other pork products other than ham and german coffee the ustro said it would continually re evaluate these tariffs based on our discussions with the eu and expects to enter talks in a bid to resolve the dispute still some italian foods parmesan reggiano romano and provolone cheese were hit with tariffs as were italian fruits clams and yogurt also seeing new tariffs are german and british camera parts industrial microwave ovens printed books sweet biscuits and waffles the us has also imposed a  levy on eu made airplanes that could hurt us airlines that have ordered billions of dollars of airbus aircraft food importers in the us were dismayed by the move and said the levies would hurt the upcoming crucial christmas sales period it looks pretty bad they hit cheese hard said ralph hoffman a vice president of the cheese importers association of america it comes as the global economy is already struggling with the effects of a trade war against china launched by the trump administration stock markets worldwide sold off on wednesday amid signs of an economic slowdown and worsening trade relations the eu said on wednesday it would retaliate if the us imposed tariffs cecilia malmström the eu commissioner for trade issued a statement saying the eu had shared proposals on settling the dispute in july she said our readiness to find a fair settlement remains unchanged but if the us decides to impose wto authorised countermeasures it will be pushing the eu into a situation where we will have no other option than to do the same the wto ruling is the latest blow in a  year battle between the european manufacturer and its us rival boeing over state aid given to the companies next year the wto is preparing to rule on what tariffs the eu can impose in retaliation to us state aid given to boeing the case first brought in  involved aid given to airbus by eu nations for the development of its a superjumbo jet and the smaller a the us alleged that airbus illegally received loans on preferential terms and billions of euros in grants the wto which is tasked with settling trade disputes gave a mixed verdict in  which was followed by years of appeals boeing issued a statement blaming airbus s non compliance with wto rulings as the reason for the possible tariffs a spokesman said unfortunately airbus s non compliance will negatively impact european member states industries and businesses completely unrelated to airbus s actions as well as airbus s airline customers yet even today airbus could still completely avoid these tariffs by coming into full compliance with its obligations we hope it will finally do that airbus said the imposition of tariffs would create insecurity and disruption to the aerospace industry and the broader global economy the company called for a negotiated settlement guillaume faury airbus s chief executive said airbus will continue working with its us partners customers and suppliers to address all potential consequences of such tariffs that would be a barrier against free trade and would have a negative impact on not only the us airlines but also us jobs suppliers and air travellers airbus is therefore hopeful that the us and the eu will agree to find a negotiated solution before creating serious damage to the aviation industry as well as to trade relations and the global economy airbus and boeing vie every year for the top position in the aircraft manufacturing and sales leagues boeing last year delivered  planes to customers six more than airbus boeing has endured one of the most difficult years in its history after two crashes involving its  max jet that killed  people following the apparent malfunction of safety features ,Boeing Crisis,0.160817042
"Ryanair has written to UK pilots asking them to take unpaid leave or transfer to other bases abroad, saying they could otherwise join the 9,000 job losses at Thomas Cook.The airline, which reported profits of €1bn (£886m) in May, told its pilots that a “significant surplus of pilots must be reduced” at UK bases including Stansted and Manchester, and that it was encouraging them to take up to 12 months of unpaid leave.It said that there were limited vacancies for full-time pilots at bases in Morocco, Romania and Hungary.The memo, sent on Tuesday, said: “With yesterday’s collapse of Thomas Cook with the loss of 9,000 jobs in the UK and potentially a further 13,000 jobs across Europe, we hope that there will be sufficient applications for unpaid leave/part time, so we do not have to resort to job losses at [your base] this winter.”It blamed the delay to Boeing 737 Max deliveries for the decision. Ryanair had ordered up to 135 of the aircraft for its expansion plans, with the first planes due this year. The model remains grounded, however, since the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes.The memo came a week after UK pilots called off the remainder of a series of strikes this month. The pilots union, Balpa, had complained about Ryanair’s “abysmal approach to industrial relations” and said the dispute over pay and conditions was driven by resentment over a range of cost-saving measures used by Ryanair.Ryanair had called the strikes pointless and managed to operate the majority of its UK schedules by bringing in more contractors and pilots from overseas bases. The airline had warned of winter base closures across Europe.Last week, the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, was awarded a new pay package in which he could receive a €99m (£88m) bonus within five years, although almost half of Ryanair shareholders voted against it.",Ryanair urge UK pilots to transfer overseas or face job losses,2019-09-25/19:22:41,ryanair has written to uk pilots asking them to take unpaid leave or transfer to other bases abroad saying they could otherwise join the   job losses at thomas cook the airline which reported profits of bn m in may told its pilots that a significant surplus of pilots must be reduced at uk bases including stansted and manchester and that it was encouraging them to take up to  months of unpaid leave it said that there were limited vacancies for full time pilots at bases in morocco romania and hungary the memo sent on tuesday said with yesterday s collapse of thomas cook with the loss of   jobs in the uk and potentially a further   jobs across europe we hope that there will be sufficient applications for unpaid leave part time so we do not have to resort to job losses at your base this winter it blamed the delay to boeing  max deliveries for the decision ryanair had ordered up to  of the aircraft for its expansion plans with the first planes due this year the model remains grounded however since the ethiopian airlines and lion air crashes the memo came a week after uk pilots called off the remainder of a series of strikes this month the pilots union balpa had complained about ryanair s abysmal approach to industrial relations and said the dispute over pay and conditions was driven by resentment over a range of cost saving measures used by ryanair ryanair had called the strikes pointless and managed to operate the majority of its uk schedules by bringing in more contractors and pilots from overseas bases the airline had warned of winter base closures across europe last week the chief executive michael o leary was awarded a new pay package in which he could receive a m m bonus within five years although almost half of ryanair shareholders voted against it ,Boeing Crisis,0.28082481
"Australia’s air safety regulator may refuse permission for Boeing 737 Max planes to fly even if its US counterpart revokes an order grounding the aircraft, which has crashed twice, leaving 346 people dead.A Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman said that the decision of the US Federal Aviation Administration would be an important factor in deciding whether to allow the Max to fly, but Casa would also take into account other information before making its decision.“As the certifying authority for the aircraft type, obviously the FAA is central to the decision as to whether the aircraft flies or not but in this case due to the nature of it there is focus on the aircraft from authorities around the world,” the spokesman said.He said Casa had been sharing information with other regulators including the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the Canadian regulator, Transport Canada, both of which have said they will do their own assessments of the Max.“Those views will form part of our thinking when we make a decision,” he said.He said there was no set timeframe in which Casa would make its call.National aviation safety bodies usually accept the decision of a manufacturer’s home regulator – in this case the FAA – but the deadly Max crashes have raised concerns the US authority failed to properly oversee Boeing.Global air safety authorities, including Casa, are due to meet on Monday in Montreal to discuss the Max issue at a meeting called by the FAA.No Australian airlines currently fly the Max, but Virgin has 48 on order and Qantas has also expressed interest in buying the plane. Until Casa banned the planes from flying on 13 March it was used by on flights in and out of Australia by two overseas airlines, Fiji Airways and Singapore’s SilkAir.The Max, which was Boeing’s fastest-selling model, was attractive to airlines because it has larger engines than the standard 737, giving it a longer range and greater capacity.But the planes were grounded in March after Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board.It was the second lethal Max crash in six months. In October 2018, a Lion Air flight from Jakarta to Bangka Island plummeted into the Java Sea, killing all 189 passengers and crew.The day after the Ethiopian Airlines crash the FAA defended the airworthiness of the Max, but within two days it was forced to ground the fleet  by Donald Trump.Investigations have focused on an automated system that under some circumstances can compensate for the extra lift generated by the bigger engines by pushing the nose of the plane down.The crashes have also raised concerns that engineering quality at Boeing may have suffered as the company pursued profits in competition with its European rival, Airbus.In early April, the FAA set up a joint technical review team with other aviation authorities, including Europe’s Easa and Australia’s Casa.A fortnight ago, the FAA said the team was “taking additional time to finish documenting its work”.“We expect the group to submit its observations, findings, and recommendations in the coming weeks,” it said.",Australia may ban Boeing 737 Max even if US gives it all-clear,2019-09-20/04:04:26,australia s air safety regulator may refuse permission for boeing  max planes to fly even if its us counterpart revokes an order grounding the aircraft which has crashed twice leaving  people dead a civil aviation safety authority spokesman said that the decision of the us federal aviation administration would be an important factor in deciding whether to allow the max to fly but casa would also take into account other information before making its decision as the certifying authority for the aircraft type obviously the faa is central to the decision as to whether the aircraft flies or not but in this case due to the nature of it there is focus on the aircraft from authorities around the world the spokesman said he said casa had been sharing information with other regulators including the european union aviation safety agency and the canadian regulator transport canada both of which have said they will do their own assessments of the max those views will form part of our thinking when we make a decision he said he said there was no set timeframe in which casa would make its call national aviation safety bodies usually accept the decision of a manufacturer s home regulator in this case the faa but the deadly max crashes have raised concerns the us authority failed to properly oversee boeing global air safety authorities including casa are due to meet on monday in montreal to discuss the max issue at a meeting called by the faa no australian airlines currently fly the max but virgin has  on order and qantas has also expressed interest in buying the plane until casa banned the planes from flying on  march it was used by on flights in and out of australia by two overseas airlines fiji airways and singapore s silkair the max which was boeing s fastest selling model was attractive to airlines because it has larger engines than the standard  giving it a longer range and greater capacity but the planes were grounded in march after ethiopian airlines flight  crashed in addis ababa killing all  people on board it was the second lethal max crash in six months in october  a lion air flight from jakarta to bangka island plummeted into the java sea killing all  passengers and crew the day after the ethiopian airlines crash the faa defended the airworthiness of the max but within two days it was forced to ground the fleet by donald trump investigations have focused on an automated system that under some circumstances can compensate for the extra lift generated by the bigger engines by pushing the nose of the plane down the crashes have also raised concerns that engineering quality at boeing may have suffered as the company pursued profits in competition with its european rival airbus in early april the faa set up a joint technical review team with other aviation authorities including europe s easa and australia s casa a fortnight ago the faa said the team was taking additional time to finish documenting its work we expect the group to submit its observations findings and recommendations in the coming weeks it said ,Boeing Crisis,0.384623826
"American Airlines (AA) pilots angrily confronted a Boeing official about an anti-stall system suspected in two fatal crashes of the manufacturer’s 737 Max aircraft, according to a new recording.In audio obtained by CBS News, members of AA’s pilots’ union quizzed Boeing officials about the system – knowns as MCAS – in a tense meeting in November last year, weeks after a Lion Air Max crashed in Indonesia and four months before the loss of an Ethiopian Airlines Max. In total, 346 people died in the two crashes.Boeing has been criticized for not disclosing how the MCAS anti-stall system worked – a move that allowed the company to avoid costly retraining.“We flat-out deserve to know what is on our airplanes,” one pilot is heard saying in the recording.“These guys didn’t even know the damn system was on the airplane – nor did anybody else,” another said.The official, Boeing vice-president Mike Sinnett, claimed the Lion Air disaster was a once-in-a-lifetime accident.He said: “I don’t know that understanding this system would’ve changed the outcome on this. In a million miles, you’re going to maybe fly this airplane, maybe once you’re going to see this, ever. So we try not to overload the crews with information that’s unnecessary so they actually know the information we believe is important.”The pilots countered: “We’re the last line of defence to being in that smoking hole, and we need the knowledge.”Boeing said it would make software changes but did not want to “rush and do crappy job of fixing the right things”. The fix was still being developed when the Ethiopian Airlines jet went down.The release of the recording came as the House transportation committee opened a hearing into the role of Boeing’s regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in certifying the Max.Democrat Rick Larsen, a member of the committee and the chair of the aviation subcommittee, said: “The FAA has a credibility problem.” He cited a Wall Street Journal story that claimed an internal review had found that senior FAA officials did not participate in or monitor crucial safety assessments of MCAS.Larsen said: “If that is in fact true, the [designation] process is not working as Congress intended.”The acting FAA administrator, Daniel Elwell, said he was “not aware of an internal assessment that reaches that conclusion”.Elwell was criticized for the FAA’s decision to hold off on grounding the US’s Max fleet after the second crash. The FAA was the last major world regulator to ground the plane and did so only after Donald Trump announced that the plane would be grounded.Democratic congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton said: “Why did it take so long compared to other countries? The public wants to know: why did it take so long?”Elwell said the FAA was a “data-driven, risk based system” and acted after it had received sufficient data to link the two crashes.","Pilots confronted Boeing with 737 Max fears after first fatal crash, audio reveals",2019-05-15/17:44:03,american airlines aa pilots angrily confronted a boeing official about an anti stall system suspected in two fatal crashes of the manufacturer s  max aircraft according to a new recording in audio obtained by cbs news members of aa s pilots union quizzed boeing officials about the system knowns as mcas in a tense meeting in november last year weeks after a lion air max crashed in indonesia and four months before the loss of an ethiopian airlines max in total  people died in the two crashes boeing has been criticized for not disclosing how the mcas anti stall system worked a move that allowed the company to avoid costly retraining we flat out deserve to know what is on our airplanes one pilot is heard saying in the recording these guys didn t even know the damn system was on the airplane nor did anybody else another said the official boeing vice president mike sinnett claimed the lion air disaster was a once in a lifetime accident he said i don t know that understanding this system would ve changed the outcome on this in a million miles you re going to maybe fly this airplane maybe once you re going to see this ever so we try not to overload the crews with information that s unnecessary so they actually know the information we believe is important the pilots countered we re the last line of defence to being in that smoking hole and we need the knowledge boeing said it would make software changes but did not want to rush and do crappy job of fixing the right things the fix was still being developed when the ethiopian airlines jet went down the release of the recording came as the house transportation committee opened a hearing into the role of boeing s regulator the federal aviation administration faa in certifying the max democrat rick larsen a member of the committee and the chair of the aviation subcommittee said the faa has a credibility problem he cited a wall street journal story that claimed an internal review had found that senior faa officials did not participate in or monitor crucial safety assessments of mcas larsen said if that is in fact true the designation process is not working as congress intended the acting faa administrator daniel elwell said he was not aware of an internal assessment that reaches that conclusion elwell was criticized for the faa s decision to hold off on grounding the us s max fleet after the second crash the faa was the last major world regulator to ground the plane and did so only after donald trump announced that the plane would be grounded democratic congresswoman eleanor holmes norton said why did it take so long compared to other countries the public wants to know why did it take so long elwell said the faa was a data driven risk based system and acted after it had received sufficient data to link the two crashes ,Boeing Crisis,0.308519095
"The global grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max jets will cost the company more than $1bn, the company said on Wednesday.The jets were grounded after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, triggering investigations into the accidents across the world and engulfing Boeing in one of the biggest crises in its history.In its first quarterly earnings report since the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines disasters, Boeing announced it had abandoned its 2019 financial outlook and halted share buy-backs in mid-March as it deals with the crisis.Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chairman and chief executive officer, said: “We have great sorrow for the families affected. This weighs heavily on us.”He said the company’s first priority was to get the 737 Max back in the air and that the company was working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other regulators to end the aircraft grounding.The announcement was a sharp reversal from Boeing’s last earnings report in January, when executives unveiled plans to deliver more than 900 jetliners this year alongside higher sales and profits.The world’s largest plane-maker reported first-quarter revenue and cashflow below sharply lowered Wall Street estimates, largely due to stopping deliveries of the 737 Max jets, which were grounded in March after the two crashes.The crashes caused regulators worldwide to ground the 737 Max and triggered investigations into the aircraft’s development by federal transportation authorities and the US Department of Justice.Although safety experts have raised some questions over crew performance in both crashes, the regulatory fallout has been dominated so far by questions over anti-stall software known as MCAS, which Boeing has acknowledged was a common link in the separate chains of events leading to both crashes.Boeing’s close relationship with the FAA and its role in the certification of the plane have come under scrutiny. Calvin Scovel, the Transportation Department’s inspector general, is conducting an audit of the FAA’s certification of the 737 Max.Muilenburg said he could not give further details about the ongoing investigations but denied that anything had “slipped through the certification process”. He said erroneous data from the planes’ systems plus “actions or actions not taken” had contributed to the crashes.This week shareholder advisory group Pensions & Investment Research Consultants (PIRC) opposed Muilenburg’s re-election as chairman and chief executive officer. “No one individual should have unfettered powers of decision,” PIRC said.Boeing cut production of the jets following the crashes to 42 aircraft per month, down from 52, and its operating cash flow in the first quarter was about $350m lower than a year earlier.Boeing also said it booked unspecified charges related to developing a fix for MCAS and pilot training, and was making steady progress toward certification of the software after completing more than 135 test and production flights.The company said it would be issuing a new forecast in the future when it has more clarity around the issues surrounding the 737 Max.Last week, an expert panel of the FAA judged that a software fix to the Max would be “operationally suitable,” and that airline pilots familiar with previous versions of the 737 won’t need additional time in flight simulators to learn about the new software that is unique to the Max.Jim Corridore, an airline analyst for CFRA Research, said that while Boeing still has much work to do, the FAA panel’s determination “shows that the return of the plane to flying is now a ‘when’ question rather than ‘if’ ... we remain firm in our view that Boeing will survive this with its order book largely intact.”",Boeing: global grounding of 737 Max will cost company more than

street estimates largely due to stopping deliveries of the  max jets which were grounded in march after the two crashes the crashes caused regulators worldwide to ground the  max and triggered investigations into the aircraft s development by federal transportation authorities and the us department of justice although safety experts have raised some questions over crew performance in both crashes the regulatory fallout has been dominated so far by questions over anti stall software known as mcas which boeing has acknowledged was a common link in the separate chains of events leading to both crashes boeing s close relationship with the faa and its role in the certification of the plane have come under scrutiny calvin scovel the transportation department s inspector general is conducting an audit of the faa s certification of the  max muilenburg said he could not give further details about the ongoing investigations but denied that anything had slipped through the certification process he said erroneous data from the planes systems plus actions or actions not taken had contributed to the crashes this week shareholder advisory group pensions investment research consultants pirc opposed muilenburg s re election as chairman and chief executive officer no one individual should have unfettered powers of decision pirc said boeing cut production of the jets following the crashes to  aircraft per month down from  and its operating cash flow in the first quarter was about m lower than a year earlier boeing also said it booked unspecified charges related to developing a fix for mcas and pilot training and was making steady progress toward certification of the software after completing more than  test and production flights the company said it would be issuing a new forecast in the future when it has more clarity around the issues surrounding the  max last week an expert panel of the faa judged that a software fix to the max would be operationally suitable and that airline pilots familiar with previous versions of the  won t need additional time in flight simulators to learn about the new software that is unique to the max jim corridore an airline analyst for cfra research said that while boeing still has much work to do the faa panel s determination shows that the return of the plane to flying is now a when question rather than if we remain firm in our view that boeing will survive this with its order book largely intact ,Boeing Crisis,0.339231879
"America First nationalism, indulgent free market economics, Republican libertarianism and a political system in hock to corporate lobbying has just contributed to killing 356 innocent people. The more we know about the crashes of Boeing 737 Max 8 planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia – after anti-stalling devices locked both aircraft into unrecoverable nose-dives – the more shocking the story becomes.It is not just Boeing, a once magnificent company, that is being condemned – it is the US’s wider economic, political and regulatory structures. What is not required is a short-term software fix on the faulty MCAS system that automatically adjusts the plane’s flight trajectory, along with an improved safety manual and training for pilots, which is Boeing’s response so far. What is needed is a root-and-branch overhaul of the intersection between capitalism and democracy in the US. The current set-up – and the accompanying libertarian, anti-state, anti-regulation philosophy – literally kills people.The story begins in 2011. Europe’s new Airbus 320neo, with its superb fuel efficiency and low operating costs, had picked up 667 orders at the Paris air show, a record for a commercial aircraft. Worse, American Airlines had done the unthinkable: it had ordered 130 of the new Airbus and 130 of the older one. Boeing’s relationship with American was foundational: it could always rely on the airline for its bedrock business, an insider, all-American affair. Now American had dared to buy European in unprecedented volumes: it was a competitive necessity to match rival airlines. Boeing had to respond. But instead of developing a whole new plane that could carry heavier, fuel-efficient engines, it made the fateful decision to bolt them on to a variant of its 737 series. Since the days of Orville and Wilbur Wright, the key to safe flying has been to organise the pitch of the plane so that its aerodynamics work to prevent stalling, a complex interrelationship between the angle and shape of wings, the distribution of weight and the power of the engines. If you intend to use a heavier, more fuel-efficient engine, it will throw everything out of kilter. Essentially, you have to design a new plane.Boeing’s initial and correct reaction had been to commit to just that, but the process is enormously expensive and takes up to 10 years. The company had to react faster and keep its share price up, so the Max 8 was born, going into service in 2017. The technical problem was obvious. With heavier engines, the pitch of a plane with wholly different dynamics could be disturbed in some flying conditions. Hence the sensor in the front of the plane that would recognise changes in pitch and automatically adjust the wings to keep the plane stable, not in principle a bad idea, but one that requires hyper-reliability and a way for pilots to override the system when necessary.In the world of aerospace, such judgment calls should have required an entire recertification process and verification by a third party. That did not happen. For decades, regulation in the US has been hamstrung by the libertarian charge that government is inefficient and always wrong, taxes are a coercive infringement of individual liberty, and regulation inhibits private sector dynamism. The Federal Aviation Authority has an enviable technical reputation, but over the past decade it has suffered from successive budget cuts and government shutdowns as the Republican party has waged war on federal spending and federal agencies. Donald Trump, before the crashes, said he wanted to privatise the agency and scale it back even more.In order to function at all, the FAA has had to delegate regulation to airlines and manufacturers – the fox looking after the chicken coop. Essentially, Boeing decided that the Max 8 did not need recertification and this decision was not challenged by the FAA. Moreover, Boeing undertook much of the safety work itself without any independent review, although as yet the outside world does not know to what degree. What we do know is that 1,000 Boeing employees are seconded to the FAA. Boeing then decided to market the Max 8 as part of the 737 family rather than as a plane with wholly different flight characteristics and a new automated software system that, crucially, did not allow pilots to override in an emergency using standard, practised techniques. Instead, they would need special training, which was not offered or provided.When the first crash happened, Boeing did not ground all Max 8s; the FAA also failed to act. American prestige was at stake, along with Boeing’s commercial interests. Tellingly, after the second crash, the US was the last to ground the aircraft. But then Boeing is one of the US’s top 10 corporate lobbyists, contributing to Democrats and Republicans alike: juicy defence contracts, government backing for trade fights with Airbus and organising benign regulation costs money. But on safety it has backfired spectacularly.Boeing is now enveloped in an existential crisis. The libertarian thinking the company exploited has caused a collapse in its reputation and reinforced a long-overdue reaction to the excesses of corporate America. In my Radio 4 documentary, Goliath, I report on the growing intellectual and political revolt against the US right’s attempt to muzzle US policy on challenging monopolies. No, the market will not automatically correct them, the doctrine that has held sway since the 1980s. Companies as disparate as Amazon, Boeing and Facebook need challengers, constraints on their power and tough independent regulators.The conventional wisdom is that Trump’s re-election may be hard to stop. But it neglects growing alarm in the US about abuses of corporate power. The refrain is: “Let Donald Trump and his transport secretary, Elaine Chao (whose chief qualification for office is that she is the partner of the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell), go on the first 300 test flights when the Max 8 goes back into service.” Leading British Brexiters, so in love with all things American and distrustful of anything European, can fly with them.

"The pilots of the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max that crashed last month killing 157 people correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down, investigators said.In the final seconds before the crash, pilots tried desperately to right the plane by switching its anti-stall software on and off but to no avail. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.The Ethiopian government said data from the plane’s recorders showed “repetitive uncommanded aircraft nose-down conditions” and said Boeing should review its aircraft control system.The country’s transport minister, Dagmawit Moges, did not cite the aircraft’s controversial anti-stall system by name, but said: “The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft.”The initial findings will intensify pressure on Boeing to explain and resolve the issues with its Max jets, the company’s newest airplanes, which have been grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes in five months.The Boeing jet crashed on 10 March shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. It was the second crash of a 737 Max after the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October, which killed 189 people.Ethiopian Airlines said the report clearly showed that the pilots had followed procedures. “Despite their hard work and full compliance with the emergency procedures, it was very unfortunate that they could not recover the plane from the persistence of nosediving,” it said.Ethiopian investigators said the full investigation to determine what other factors may have been involved could take up to a year.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp dive into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane's black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines becomes the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.In the wake of Boeing’s troubles, Airbus seems set to overtake it as the world's biggest planemaker. As Boeing reported 239 commercial plane deliveries in the first half of the year, a 37% fall, rival Airbus shipped 389 deliveries, up 28% on the same period last year.Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.While air investigation reports do not apportion blame, the Ethiopian inquiry has again highlighted the 737 Max control system. Indonesian investigations into the Lion Air crash have focused on Boeing’s anti-stall system, Mcas, new on the Max model of 737 aircraft.After the news conference, Moges told the New York Times that the Ethiopian Airlines pilots “turned the Mcas on and off, but I can’t say how many times because we will find that out when we have the final report”.Pilots on the Lion Air flight, which also crashed within minutes of takeoff, battled to keep the plane pointing upwards as Mcas forced the nose down. After that crash, Boeing issued instructions to pilots on how to override the Mcas system, but the Ethiopian crash report suggests they may not have worked.On Thursday Boeing announced that new software would ensure that pilots will always have the authority to override the system if it is activated by faulty sensor data.“I’d like to reiterate our deepest sympathies are with the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in the accident,” said Kevin McAllister, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive. “We thank Ethiopia’s Accident Investigation Bureau [AIB] for its hard work and continuing efforts. Understanding the circumstances that contributed to this accident is critical to ensuring safe flight. We will carefully review the AIB’s preliminary report, and will take any and all additional steps necessary to enhance the safety of our aircraft.”Boeing could be left liable for huge payouts to victims and airlines. Lawsuits relating to both disasters have already been filed in the US, and some pilots have complained that the new features in the Max were not the subject of more comprehensive retraining.The manufacturer also faces an investigation by the US Department of Justice, with FBI involvement, into its development process, and Senate hearings into how the Federal Aviation Administration allowed it to self-certify parts of its aircraft.The 737 is Boeing’s bestselling current model, with about 5,000 orders worth up to $600bn (£456bn), of which 300 planes have so far been delivered to airlines.

"Investigators believe Boeing’s controversial anti-stall system on its 737 Max aircraft was activated before Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 crashed, killing all 157 people onboard, according to reports of a high-level safety briefing with US regulators.The apparent findings, reported in the Wall Street Journal, would be the strongest indication yet that the same software problem could have contributed to the crash and that of Lion Air flight 610, which killed 189 people in Indonesia in October.Investigators in the Lion Air case highlighted how pilots battled to keep the plane pointing upwards as the system automatically forced the nose down.Ethiopian Airlines officials and Ethiopia’s transport minister have already said their 737 jet appeared to fly in a similar pattern to the Lion Air plane, both of which displayed erratic altitude during their short time in the air after takeoff.A preliminary report into the latest crash could be released by Ethiopian authorities within days. US officials at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had been briefed, Reuters said, on the contents of the black box recorders, which are being analysed in Paris by French air crash investigators.Boeing also faces legal action from relatives of those who died when the Nairobi-bound plane crashed on 10 March soon after taking off from Addis Ababa.The family of Jackson Musoni, a Rwandan citizen, filed in Chicago what appeared to be the first lawsuit related to the crash. It claims Boeing had defectively designed the automated flight control system and failed to warn the public, airlines and pilots of the plane’s allegedly erroneous sensors.Boeing said it could not comment on the lawsuit. Similar claims have already been brought in relation to the Lion Air crash.More legal action is expected to follow, with relatives considering a class action.Antonis Mavropoulos, who narrowly missed the flight, said: “I know that many of them are in contact with lawyers. I think that most of them will want to take this further.”The Greek engineer, who was turned away at the departure gate two minutes after it closed, is now spearheading a campaign to uncover why the plane went down. He said it was vital European authorities also became involved in the investigation.“This should be a turning point for the aviation industry,” Mavropoulos said. “The European parliament must also play a role. Everything points to fatal safety flaws and the problem lying with Boeing, deregulation of the industry and the way the 737 Max got approved by the FAA.”Mavropoulos, 53, said he had been deluged with thousands of messages, many from retired pilots and aviation experts, who he said expressed concerns that market competition was downgrading safety. He said he felt a moral obligation to find out why the plane crashed, adding: “Yes, I was lucky, but I now know I was not the only one. Thousands who have travelled with the plane were lucky too.”Boeing outlined this week steps it would take to restore its bestselling latest model to the air, including a planned software fix that would prevent the anti-stall system, known as Mcas, from repeatedly operating.Cockpit alerts to warn of potentially incorrect data from sensors will also be fitted as standard. While investigators found sensors had given wrong information about the angle of the plane before the Lion Air crash, neither the Indonesian nor Ethiopian planes displayed warnings, a safety feature sold as an optional extra.Boeing said it had also developed a mandatory training package for 737 Max pilots to undergo before the worldwide ban on flying the model is lifted. But it still proposes that qualified 737 pilots would not need time on flight simulators to safely operate the aircraft.The US Department of Justice is investigating Boeing’s development process, while the government is to review how the FAA certifies new aircraft, with questions being asked about the extent of self-certification by manufacturers.It appears US and European regulators were aware at least two years before the first 737 Max crash that the method for controlling the plane’s nose angle might not work in certain conditions.According to Reuters, European Aviation Safety Agency documents from 2016 certified the plane as safe, partly because training would “clearly explain” to pilots the “unusual” situations in which they would need use a manual wheel on the flight deck to adjust the angle. But those situations were not listed in the flight manual used by American Airlines, Reuters said.",Investigators 'believe Ethiopian 737 Max's anti-stall system activated',2019-03-29/13:09:27+0000,investigators believe boeing s controversial anti stall system on its  max aircraft was activated before ethiopian airlines flight et crashed killing all  people onboard according to reports of a high level safety briefing with us regulators the apparent findings reported in the wall street journal would be the strongest indication yet that the same software problem could have contributed to the crash and that of lion air flight  which killed  people in indonesia in october investigators in the lion air case highlighted how pilots battled to keep the plane pointing upwards as the system automatically forced the nose down ethiopian airlines officials and ethiopia s transport minister have already said their  jet appeared to fly in a similar pattern to the lion air plane both of which displayed erratic altitude during their short time in the air after takeoff a preliminary report into the latest crash could be released by ethiopian authorities within days us officials at the federal aviation administration faa had been briefed  said on the contents of the black box recorders which are being analysed in paris by french air crash investigators boeing also faces legal action from relatives of those who died when the nairobi bound plane crashed on  march soon after taking off from addis ababa the family of jackson musoni a rwandan citizen filed in chicago what appeared to be the first lawsuit related to the crash it claims boeing had defectively designed the automated flight control system and failed to warn the public airlines and pilots of the plane s allegedly erroneous sensors boeing said it could not comment on the lawsuit similar claims have already been brought in relation to the lion air crash more legal action is expected to follow with relatives considering a class action antonis mavropoulos who narrowly missed the flight said i know that many of them are in contact with lawyers i think that most of them will want to take this further the greek engineer who was turned away at the departure gate two minutes after it closed is now spearheading a campaign to uncover why the plane went down he said it was vital european authorities also became involved in the investigation this should be a turning point for the aviation industry mavropoulos said the european parliament must also play a role everything points to fatal safety flaws and the problem lying with boeing deregulation of the industry and the way the  max got approved by the faa mavropoulos  said he had been deluged with thousands of messages many from retired pilots and aviation experts who he said expressed concerns that market competition was downgrading safety he said he felt a moral obligation to find out why the plane crashed adding yes i was lucky but i now know i was not the only one thousands who have travelled with the plane were lucky too boeing outlined this week steps it would take to restore its bestselling latest model to the air including a planned software fix that would prevent the anti stall system known as mcas from repeatedly operating cockpit alerts to warn of potentially incorrect data from sensors will also be fitted as standard while investigators found sensors had given wrong information about the angle of the plane before the lion air crash neither the indonesian nor ethiopian planes displayed warnings a safety feature sold as an optional extra boeing said it had also developed a mandatory training package for  max pilots to undergo before the worldwide ban on flying the model is lifted but it still proposes that qualified  pilots would not need time on flight simulators to safely operate the aircraft the us department of justice is investigating boeing s development process while the government is to review how the faa certifies new aircraft with questions being asked about the extent of self certification by manufacturers it appears us and european regulators were aware at least two years before the first  max crash that the method for controlling the plane s nose angle might not work in certain conditions according to  european aviation safety agency documents from  certified the plane as safe partly because training would clearly explain to pilots the unusual situations in which they would need use a manual wheel on the flight deck to adjust the angle but those situations were not listed in the flight manual used by american airlines  said ,Boeing Crisis,0.405070215
"Transport bosses need little prodding in public to utter the words “safety is our number one priority” – a mantra so widespread that, as with an English person inquiring “How do you do?” the inherent insincerity is barely noted.Clearly, the main objective of rail companies, airlines or carmakers is moving people or things, for profit, with all the risk that entails. What those industries have excelled at is vastly reducing that risk. In Britain, more than 11 years have elapsed since a passenger was killed in a train crash. Fatality rates in car accidents are declining, particularly for drivers; yesterday the European commission announced that extra safety features, including automatic speed limiters, would soon be mandatory.Aviation in particular has long enjoyed the statistical claim to be the safest form of transport. Worldwide, modern passenger jets appeared to have reached a point where they never crashed without the deliberate, malign intervention of terrorists or suicidal pilots. But the fate of the two Boeing 737 Max planes, which both crashed soon after takeoff, has perhaps done more to undermine faith in the industry’s own processes than any preceding incidents in recent history.Questions have been asked of the regulator, the US Federal Aviation Administration, and the scope it gave Boeing to verify its own plane’s safety. Boeing has convened pilots, regulators and technical experts today to explain their work and try to restore confidence – shaken again this week by the emergency landing in Florida of a 737 Max that was being moved for storage purposes while banned from passenger service.No airline would ever want to believe it was flying a plane that might crash. But some suggest that the cumulative commercial pressures that airlines feel have ways of resurfacing throughout an industry, with potentially nefarious effects. Airlines vie to offer cheaper fares; costs per seat can be offered via newer, more fuel-efficient planes. A new model is even more cost-effective if it does not require highly paid pilots – trainers and trainees – to be taken off active duty to spend time at bases in simulators.We now know that at least some US 737 pilots were appalled to discover that only short “differences training”, self-taught in a short session on an iPad, was deemed necessary to learn to fly the updated 737 Max, whose design was different enough for Boeing to decide new anti-stall software was needed. It’s difficult to read even the cold, formal, occasionally broken English of the preliminary report into the first 737 Max crash in Indonesia without feeling the horror: two young Lion Air pilots, thousands of feet up in the air, clueless how to battle an onboard computer that was repeatedly, erroneously, pushing the nose of the plane down. The software countermanded the pilots’ instructions 26 times in a row, and finally took 189 people into the sea. Subsequent reports of cockpit voice recordings show that the pilots were desperately leafing through the manual.We now also know that Boeing had designed safety features and warning lights for the 737 Max as an optional extra purchase – money that airlines in the US decided was worth spending, though carriers in the Ethiopia and Indonesia crashes did not. Those will now be standard.Neither are safety regulators immune from financial pressures. Indeed, the firms they regulate are the ones often paying for their services – in other words, customers who can in some circumstances shop around. Cost-cutting at Britain’s own air safety regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, led to a large exodus of experienced staff, and whistleblowers afterwards leaked a highly critical internal report claiming passenger safety was at risk. Today light-touch regulation – assessing airlines’ competency to certify their own safety, rather than employing inspectors to actually do the checks – is broadly accepted in the industry. But it coincided with the Shoreham crash, the worst airshow disaster in 60 years; investigators turned their fire on the CAA’s licensing regime, which had inspected just eight of 281 shows approved.In the US, politicians have long queried the closeness of the FAA to Boeing, the manufacturer it regulates – but to which it also delegates aspects of aircraft safety certification. Yesterday again the FAA defended that practice in a Senate hearing on cost grounds.The idea that cutting corners or costs risks such loss of human life feels obscene. Yet arguably those are choices made any time someone opts to buy a car faster and less reinforced than a square and solid Volvo. In government accounting, the value of a prevented fatality has a number. But honest conversations about the amount of risk we are prepared to tolerate are rare.One answer the Department for Transport came up with to drive down the spiralling costs of rail travel was to cut guards on trains. This week, the rail accident investigation board reported how, for the third time recently, dozens of angry passengers trapped in a stuck train with no guard decided to disembark on to the tracks, at high risk of electrocution or being hit by other trains. Nonetheless, many rail operators – and doubtless passengers when questioned on fare levels – regard cutting guards as a sensible trade-off.Disasters tend to shift that perception of acceptable risk. As Amy Fraher, author of The Next Crash: How Short-Term Profit Seeking Trumps Airline Safety, observed in her 2014 book, few in finance saw the risks developing before banks imploded in 2008, and aviation processes could be under similar strain. According to her research, a majority of US pilots believed a combination of fatigued staff and commercial pressures would soon lead to another crash. To take for granted increases in safety – the result of many years of often expensive, laborious rule-making and regulation – could again prove a fatal mistake.• Gwyn Topham is the Guardian’s

"The anti-stall system that pilots battled before the crash of a Lion Air-operated Boeing 737 Max in October was also likely to have been activated before 157 people were killed this month on a flight of the same model leaving Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian Airlines chief executive has said.The new feature of the 737 Max, the manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system (MCAS), has been highlighted by an investigation into the previous crash, in which 189 people were killed when their plane went down in the Java Sea off Indonesia 12 minutes after takeoff.Ethiopian’s boss, Tewolde GebreMariam, told the Wall Street Journal he believed MCAS was also “to the best of our knowledge” in play for the brief duration of flight 302 from Addis Ababa.MCAS automatically forces the nose of the plane down to prevent stalling, and was introduced to compensate for the new position of engines on the 737 Max model. A preliminary report into the Lion Air crash has suggested the combination of incorrect sensor readings and MCAS contributed to the plane diving into the sea.GebreMariam’s reported remarks are the first from a senior official close to the flight to confirm that MCAS was operating, although he said that only the investigation would provide conclusive evidence. The black boxes are in Paris being analysed by France’s air crash investigation bureau, the BEA.In an official statement released by Ethiopian on Monday morning, GebreMariam said he did “not want to speculate as to the cause” but “many questions on the 737 Max airplane remain without answers”.He again stressed the modernity of the airline’s safety and training systems, which include a dedicated simulator for the 737 Max, adding: “Contrary to some media reports, our pilots who fly the new model were trained on all appropriate simulators. The crews were well trained on this aircraft.”Despite the crash, he said: “Let me be clear: Ethiopian Airlines believes in Boeing.”The vote of confidence is likely to be welcomed by Boeing, whose stock has been battered since the two crashes. The company will brief more than 200 global airline pilots, technical experts and regulators this week on software and training updates for the 737 Max. It is expected to build enhanced warning devices as standard into every plane. A cockpit light to notify of faulty sensors had been installed in many planes – including the American Airlines fleet – but was not purchased by Lion Air or Ethiopian.On Friday, the Indonesian carrier Garuda became the first airline to scrap its order for the model, blaming a lack of public trust. It has taken just one of 50 737 Max planes it has on order, worth up to $6bn on listed prices.The current global fleet of 387 planes remains grounded as investigations continue.

"Boeing reportedly sold the 737 Max planes that crashed in Indonesia and Ethiopia without two safety features that the US aircraft manufacturer offers airlines for an additional cost.It is still not clear what caused Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 to crash, but investigators have said flight data showed clear similarities between the two incidents.The two safety features in question were an “angle of attack indicator” and an “angle of attack disagree light”, both of which were not included in the aircraft by Boeing as standard safety features, according to a report in the New York Times.Reports on Thursday night suggested that Boeing will make at lelast one of the safety features – an indicator light – standard on the 737 Max 8 aircraft, according to unnamed officials cited by Associated Press.It is up to airlines to decide whether to pay for upgrades to a standard plane – a practice that is common among aircraft manufacturers and allows them to charge extra, often for aesthetic features relating to seating or lighting, but for other features relevant to the operation of planes, too.Regulators do not require airlines to buy optional extras, and many low-cost carriers opt not to.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air.

All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane's black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard.

If the software detects the nose is pointing up at a dangerous angle it has the ability to automatically push the nose down in an attempt to stop the plane stalling.One of the optional extras – the angle of attack indicator – displays the readings of the two sensors, and the other – the disagree light – is an alert that activates if those sensors do not agree.Boeing has told airlines that it expects to have new software ready by the end of the month, and it is understood that the disagree light will become a standard feature on all new 737 Max planes.The angle of attack indicator will remain an optional extra that airlines can buy, according to the New York Times report.“They’re critical, and cost almost nothing for the airlines to install,” Bjorn Fehrm, an analyst at the aviation consultancy Leeham, told the newspaper. “Boeing charges for them because it can. But they’re vital for safety.”The Guardian has approached Boeing for comment.Voice recordings from Lion Air flight 610, yet to be officially released, suggest the pilots looked through the flight manual as the jet incorrectly alerted them it was stalling and automatically pushed the nose down.

"The pilots of the Lion Air Boeing 737 Max that crashed in Indonesia were searching a flight manual to try to find why the plane kept lurching downwards against their commands, according to reports of the cockpit voice recording.The investigation into the crash, which killed all 189 people on board last October, has become even more significant for Boeing and airlines due to its suspected links with the Ethiopian Airlines disaster, where 157 died on the same model of plane.The Ethiopian government and French accident investigators have said flight data shows clear similarities between the two 737 Max crashes.According to sources who spoke to Reuters, the voice recordings from Lion Air – yet to be officially released – show that the captain asked the first officer to check the flight manual within minutes of takeoff as they struggled to control the aircraft.The captain was at the controls of Lion Air flight JT610 when the 737 Max took off from Jakarta. Two minutes into the journey, the first officer reported a “flight control problem” to air traffic control. The sources said airspeed was mentioned on the cockpit voice recording, and that an indicator showed a problem on the captain’s display but not the first officer’s.The pilots looked through the handbook containing checklists for abnormal events, as the jet incorrectly alerted pilots it was in a stall, pushing the nose down – an automated response built into the software as part of the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS) anti-stall program in the 737 Max.As the captain fought to climb, the computer continued to push the nose down. “They didn’t seem to know the trim was moving down,” the third source said. “They thought only about airspeed and altitude. That was the only thing they talked about.”The sources told Reuters that the pilots remained calm for most of the flight. Near the end, the captain asked the first officer to fly while he checked the manual. The Indian-born captain, 31, was silent at the end, while the Indonesian first officer, 41, said “Allahu Akbar”, the Arabic expression meaning “God is greatest”.The plane crashed shortly after, killing everyone on board.Lion Air said all data and information had been given to investigators and declined to comment further.Regulators around the world grounded the 737 Max model last week after a crash in Ethiopia, the second fatal disaster in five months. The black box recorders from Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 are being examined by French air accident investigators in Paris, who have yet to release an official report. However, the fact the pilot also reported flight control problems in the same new plane, which climbed erratically and crashed soon after takeoff, has left the safety of the plane in doubt.More than 300 737 Max planes have been taken out of service and deliveries suspended for another 5,000 on order. Boeing has told airlines it expects to have new software ready by the end of the month.Following the second fatal accident, US authorities are reviewing whether enough was done to ensure the plane was safe to fly. Federal prosecutors and regulators have opened an inquiry into the 737 Max’s development, with scrutiny mounting over how the US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing certified the aircraft.Questions have also been asked about the training of the Lion Air crew. Although pilots in the US have said the manufacturer did not highlight modifications to the plane’s behaviour, Boeing has said existing safety procedures would allow pilots to override the plane’s computer, should it erroneously attempt to force it down.The preliminary report into the Lion Air crash showed that a different crew flying the same plane the previous evening had encountered the same problem but solved it after running through three checklists. However, they did not pass on that experience to the next crew, the report said.According to a report from Bloomberg, disaster may have been averted on the previous flight only due to the presence of a third, off-duty pilot in the cockpit, a captain at Lion Air’s sister carrier, Batik Air, who knew how to solve the flight control problems.The final report into the Lion Air crash could be released by July, Indonesian investigators said. The cause has not been determined, but the preliminary report highlighted Boeing’s MCAS system, faulty sensors, and the airline’s maintenance and training.

"Within three minutes of takeoff, Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 had accelerated to unusually high speeds. Captain Yared Getachew knew something was wrong as the aircraft, a Boeing 737 Max 8, erratically dipped and climbed by hundreds of feet. He radioed air traffic control, requesting a return to Addis Ababa airport.He was cleared to return and the aircraft began to turn right, climbing even higher. A minute later, flight 302 disappeared from the radar.All 157 people on board were killed as the plane crashed 30 miles south-east of the airport, approximately six minutes into its two-hour flight to Nairobi. It was the second fatal accident involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in five months, following the crash last October of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia with the loss of 189 lives.Suspicion over the cause of both crashes is centred on the plane’s new flight control system – MCAS, or Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System – which can intervene to push the plane’s nose down automatically when it rises.On Wednesday, Boeing said it was suspending operations of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft, after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed a temporary ban on the model. Dozens of countries had already imposed bans earlier in the week. The fleet will be grounded until Boeing installs a software update for the jet’s flight systems, which could happen before the end of the month, according to one report last week. As Boeing scrambles to fix one of its most significant products, there are questions now over the impact on the world’s most renowned aerospace group. The crashes are devastating for Boeing because the 737 has been a staple of its roster for more than 50 years. It is the company’s bestseller and a short-haul workhorse. The new version, the Max, is more fuel-efficient than previous models and has clocked up $600bn (£450bn) worth of orders. “It’s a very important aircraft to Boeing, with 5,000 orders placed,” said John Strickland, an aviation analyst.It’s likely to be a tough few months for the Chicago-based manufacturer, with regulatory issues, legal claims and the threat of cancelled orders piling up. Last Sunday’s crash hit shares hard as soon as markets opened on Monday, and wiped $25bn from its value over the course of last week.Boeing now faces a struggle to maintain that huge order book: several big customers have threatened to cancel in the wake of the crash. VietJet, which doubled its order to about $25bn last month, said it would decide on its plans once the cause of the tragedy had been found. Others putting the squeeze on Boeing are Utair of Russia and Kenya Airways, which could switch to Airbus’s short-haul rival, the A320. Lion Air is also said to be reviewing a $22bn order for the 737.A source said: “The commercial reality is that Boeing will be offering all sorts of incentives to customers in order to persuade them to stay. If I know Boeing, it will be in company meltdown trying to sort this out. You can see what it’s doing to the share price and to passenger confidence in the 737 Max. This is tough stuff.” But crucially, its three big US customers – American, Southwest and United – are standing behind the Max.Despite the scale of the reputational and commercial crisis facing the company, many experts believe Boeing will recover, because technical problems – albeit none as fatal as the one apparently facing the 737 Max – have been overcome before. The FAA grounded the company’s 787 Dreamliner in 2013 because of a problem with its batteries catching fire, which was subsequently fixed. “That didn’t have any long-term impact on customer confidence and it has become a very successful aircraft,” Strickland noted.Regulators around the world grounded the 737 Max after concluding there were too many similarities between the Addis Ababa disaster and the crash of Lion Air flight 610. That also plummeted from the skies shortly after takeoff: a preliminary investigation shows the pilots struggled to get control of the plane after the nose was forced down by the flight control system.The seeds of Boeing’s misery were sown back in the winter of 2010. Airbus, its big European rival, caught it off guard with the news that it was relaunching its short-haul workhorse with new engines as the A320neo.Airlines had pressured the two manufacturers for a more fuel-efficient plane following a jump in the cost of oil in 2008, when a price of $147 per barrel forced dozens of carriers into bankruptcy.The A320neo forced Boeing to retaliate by creating a revamped 737 – one with engines that could deliver the fuel-efficiency now demanded by their customers.The 737 Max would do that, but not without some engineering witchcraft to help fit its big new engines under the wings. The American manufacturer had to extend the nose landing gear, add aerodynamic winglets and push the technology to make it more efficient and cheaper to operate.The engines may have solved one problem, but they created another. Testing showed that in certain conditions the plane was prone to entering a nose-up aerodynamic stall – where the aircraft cannot create enough lift from the airflow over its wings.Boeing attempted to fix the issue by installing the MCAS, which would stabilise the aircraft by bringing the nose down. This system is now at the centre of the investigation into the Lion Air crash and appears to be implicated in the Ethiopian Airlines disaster.In December, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive to all owners of the 737 Max. It warned of an issue where the automated anti-stall system would engage if “an erroneously high single AOA [angle of attack] sensor input is received by the flight control system”. The system would then automatically attempt repeated nose-down commands. “This condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, and lead to excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain,” it said.Automation has increased in order to eradicate human error, which has traditionally been the biggest cause of air accidents. David Gleave, a safety expert, said: “Very few airplanes fall out of the sky because the wings fall off. Most of the time it’s related to human error. Automation can go too far, but this is an extra security system that was brought in to cure something and has caused a problem elsewhere … There’s a history of problems with the introduction of new technology. But people are not going to stop flying in 737s because of this.”Boeing’s executives will be pleading with customers and investors for patience. But they need to come up with a fix, and soon.","After two deadly disasters in five months, can Boeing survive?",2019-03-16/16:00:07+0000,within three minutes of takeoff ethiopian airlines flight  had

"The history of aircraft development is marked by technological breakthroughs – from more fuel-efficient engines to the use of carbon-fibre materials – that have spurred the creation of better, safer aircraft. However, fatal accidents have also forced design changes that have improved subsequent aircraft and prevented further loss of life. Here are some examples.10 January 1954A De Havilland Comet operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation crashed after suffering a catastrophic decompression in mid-flight. The Comet fell into the sea near Elba, off the Italian coast: all 35 people on board died.It was the second in a series of three Comet accidents in less than a year, all from similar causes. Investigators found that structural cracking had started in the roof of the cabin: a window had become detached and struck control structures at the back of the aircraft, and the rear fuselage had then torn away.The cause was metal fatigue, arising from the constant pressurisation and depressurisation of the aircraft’s fuselage during everyday use. Also, supports around the windows had been riveted, not glued, in a process which is thought to have caused cracks.The fuselage was also experiencing considerably higher stresses than had been anticipated, particularly around the sharp corners of the Comet’s square windows. As a result, future jetliners would feature windows with rounded corners.2 August 1985The Lockheed TriStar operated by US carrier Delta encountered a thunderstorm while approaching Dallas-Fort Worth to land. The aircraft struck the ground far short of the runway and disintegrated, killing 137 people and injuring 28 others. Investigators found that the crash had resulted from the flight crew’s decision to fly through a thunderstorm; the lack of procedures or training to cope with “microbursts” (small but intense downdraughts that occur in storms); and the lack of advance warning on the sharp changes in wind speed or direction known as wind shear.After the investigation, an onboard weather radar was developed by Nasa. The resultant airborne detection and alert system was installed on many airliners after the US regulator insisted all commercial aircraft must have onboard means of detecting wind shear.22 August 1985A Boeing 737 caught fire before takeoff at Manchester airport, with the loss of 55 lives. It was on its way to Corfu, in Greece. Before takeoff, one of the engines failed, causing the fire, and the captain instructed the crew to evacuate the plane. There were 82 survivors: most of the deaths were caused by smoke inhalation.The accident brought about industry-wide action on plane design, including changes to the seating layout near exits; fire-resistant seat covers; floor-level emergency lighting; fire-resistant wall and ceiling panels; increased numbers of extinguishers; and clearer rules on evacuation procedures.31 August 1986Two planes collided in mid-air over the Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos. The tail of Aeroméxico flight 498, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, was hit by a small private plane – a Piper PA-28-181 Archer – while descending towards Los Angeles International Airport. All 67 people on both aircraft were killed, as well as an additional 15 on the ground.After that, all jets in US airspace were required to carry air avoidance collision systems. Another mid-air crash near New Delhi in 1996 – between a Boeing 747 and a Soviet-designed Ilyushin Il-76 – killed 349 people: that triggered the implementation of crash avoidance systems around the world.8 September 1994A Boeing 737 flying from Chicago crashed while approaching Pittsburgh International Airport. Investigators said the probable cause was that the aircraft’s rudder had malfunctioned and turned hard in the direction opposite to that commanded by the pilot, causing a loss of control from which the flight crew could not recover. All 132 people on board were killed.Boeing subsequently agreed to design and pay for a new rudder control system for the entire worldwide 737 fleet.1 June 2009The crash of AF 447 raised concerns about the level of automation in aircraft, and those fears have been exacerbated by the 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The Airbus A330, operated by Air France and on its way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, stalled and did not recover, crashing into the Atlantic with the loss of all 228 passengers and crew.The initial investigation concluded that the aircraft crashed after the airspeed sensors iced over, causing the autopilot to disconnect in the middle of stormy weather. This sparked an unexpected handover of control to the pilots, one of whom was not used to hand-flying at altitude and who reacted incorrectly by pulling the nose of the aircraft upwards.The pilot errors ultimately caused the aircraft to enter an aerodynamic stall – where the plane’s weight is no longer supported by the air flowing under the wings – and drop from the sky catastrophically at 11,000 feet per minute.Following the disaster, regulators urged airlines to encourage more hand-flying to prevent the erosion of basic piloting skills.",Midair collisions to metal fatigue: tragedies

"Air crash investigators have begun analysing the black box data recorder from Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, amid reports that the plane wreckage suggested similarities with a previous disaster involving the Boeing 737 Max jet.Accounts have also emerged of communications between the plane and air traffic control, in which the pilot is said to have asked in panicked tones to turn back three minutes into the flight, as the 737 Max dipped and climbed.The black box recorder, which arrived in Paris showing some external damage, is being reviewed by French aviation experts at the request of Ethiopian Airlines. French authorities have said it was unclear what data could be retrieved to shed light on Sunday’s crash, which killed 157 people outside Addis Ababa.It is likely to be several days before any interim findings are released, according to Ethiopian Airlines chief executive Tewolde Gebremariam.Evidence gathered by investigators at the scene of the crash, according to two sources cited by Reuters, includes a piece of the plane’s stabiliser, which was set in an unusual position – potentially suggesting similarities with the Lion Air crash off Jakarta in October. Gebremariam said there was a “clear similarity between our crash and the Lion Air crash.”Inquiries in Indonesia have focused on how an automated system used the stabiliser to pitch the nose down, against the pilots’ commands. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing declined to comment on the claims.The captain of Ethiopian flight 302, Yared Getachew, reported a “flight control” problem in a calm voice, before then asking to return in panicked tones three minutes after takeoff, according to the New York Times. The newspaper, citing a source who had reviewed the communications from flight 302, said the pilot told controllers: “Break break, request back to home.”The 737 Max jet initially dipped below the safe flight path, and then, after climbing, flew at erratic height and speed. Controllers noticed the plane was moving up and down by hundreds of feet.When grounding the 737 Max model on Wednesday, the FAA said new data from satellite-based tracking showed similarities between the planes’ erratic movements in both crashes. Boeing has reiterated its “full confidence” in the safety of the plane, although its engineers are making changes to the software in question in the Lion Air crash.Ethiopian Airlines said its pilots had been trained on procedures to deal with the 737 Max’s anti-stall system, which was the subject of an emergency notification by regulators after the Lion Air crash. Pilots in the US have expressed fury that Boeing had not already highlighted system changes that could affect the plane’s behaviour.Delivery of the new plane, with almost 5,000 models still on order, has been paused, although Boeing is continuing production. Russian carrier Aeroflot said on Friday it may cancel its order for 20 planes. Air Canada, which planned to expand from 24 to 36 737 Max planes in its fleet this year, told investors it was suspending its financial forecasts without the more fuel-efficient jets.In Ethiopia, officials have started taking DNA samples from families of the victims to assist in identifying remains. The 157 people who died came from 35 countries, including nine from the UK. At the crash site in Hejere, about 30 miles from Addis Ababa, search teams continued to pick through the debris, with the plane’s wreckage covered by blue plastic sheeting.Relatives were still waiting for news on when identification of remains would begin, and subsequent repatriation. Faysal Hussein, an Ethiopian citizen whose cousin was killed, told the Associated Press: “We are not told what they have found so far. We were taken to the crash site on Wednesday but not allowed to get a closer look.”Pauline Gathu, a Kenyan who lost her brother, said: “We were expecting that we will have our body well-kept but we are amazed to hear that there is nothing, totally nothing … We don’t have words, we don’t know what to do.”",Ethiopian air crash investigators begin black box analysis,2019-03-15/17:59:20+0000,air crash investigators have begun analysing the black box data recorder from ethiopian airlines flight  amid reports that the plane wreckage suggested similarities with a previous disaster involving the boeing  max jet accounts have also emerged of communications between the plane and air traffic control in which the pilot is said to have asked in panicked tones to turn back three minutes into the flight as the  max dipped and climbed the black box recorder which arrived in paris showing some external damage is being reviewed by french aviation experts at the request of ethiopian airlines french authorities have said it was unclear what data could be retrieved to shed light on sunday s crash which killed  people outside addis ababa it is likely to be several days before any interim findings are released according to ethiopian airlines chief executive tewolde gebremariam evidence gathered by investigators at the scene of the crash according to two sources cited by  includes a piece of the plane s stabiliser which was set in an unusual position potentially suggesting similarities with the lion air crash off jakarta in october gebremariam said there was a clear similarity between our crash and the lion air crash inquiries in indonesia have focused on how an automated system used the stabiliser to pitch the nose down against the pilots commands the us federal aviation administration faa and boeing declined to comment on the claims the captain of ethiopian flight  yared getachew reported a flight control problem in a calm voice before then asking to return in panicked tones three minutes after takeoff according to the new york times the newspaper citing a source who had reviewed the communications from flight  said the pilot told controllers break break request back to home the  max jet initially dipped below the safe flight path and then after climbing flew at erratic height and speed controllers noticed the plane was moving up and down by hundreds of feet when grounding the  max model on wednesday the faa said new data from satellite based tracking showed similarities between the planes erratic movements in both crashes boeing has reiterated its full confidence in the safety of the plane although its engineers are making changes to the software in question in the lion air crash ethiopian airlines said its pilots had been trained on procedures to deal with the  max s anti stall system which was the subject of an emergency notification by regulators after the lion air crash pilots in the us have expressed fury that boeing had not already highlighted system changes that could affect the plane s behaviour delivery of the new plane with almost   models still on order has been paused although boeing is continuing production russian carrier aeroflot said on friday it may cancel its order for  planes air canada which planned to expand from  to   max planes in its fleet this year told investors it was suspending its financial forecasts without the more fuel efficient jets in ethiopia officials have started taking dna samples from families of the victims to assist in identifying remains the  people who died came from  countries including nine from the uk at the crash site in hejere about  miles from addis ababa search teams continued to pick through the debris with the plane s wreckage covered by blue plastic sheeting relatives were still waiting for news on when identification of remains would begin and subsequent repatriation faysal hussein an ethiopian citizen whose cousin was killed told the associated press we are not told what they have found so far we were taken to the crash site on wednesday but not allowed to get a closer look pauline gathu a kenyan who lost her brother said we were expecting that we will have our body well kept but we are amazed to hear that there is nothing totally nothing we don t have words we don t know what to do ,Boeing Crisis,0.415468484
"Antonis Mavropoulos knows he is lucky. Alone among passengers booked on to Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302, he got to the departure gate two minutes after it had closed. “I could see a guy in a green T-shirt and others boarding and I shouted to also be let in,” he says, his voice cracking with emotion. “I am still in a state of shock knowing what happened. I’ve found it very difficult to sleep since.”Five days after the Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 Max 8 jet crashed within minutes of takeoff from Addis Ababa, the Greek chemical engineer says he feels he has a moral obligation to uncover why the plane went down, killing all 157 people onboard.“As the guy who was saved just by luck I want to say something very clear,” he says. “The souls of these people, the people who I saw and all those who died, can never be relieved unless there are concrete answers and the truth is uncovered.”The latest news alluding to design faults had especially unsettled him. “I have been reading a lot of reports about potential problematic designs, that the pilot asked soon after takeoff to go back, and to be honest it has freaked me out. I fly between 100 and 120 times a year. I very much hope this is not a case of criminal ignorance or of design issues being intentionally hidden,” he tells the Guardian during a phone interview from Beirut where he works much of the time as the head of an Athens-based waste management company.The 53-year old, who also presides over the International Solid Waste Association, an NGO headquartered in Vienna, was on his way to Nairobi via Addis Abada last weekend to attend the UN environment assembly. Travelling from Beirut overnight, he was aware that his stopover was so short that he would have to make a run for it as soon as he landed.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp dive into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane's black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines becomes the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.In the wake of Boeing’s troubles, Airbus seems set to overtake it as the world's biggest planemaker. As Boeing reported 239 commercial plane deliveries in the first half of the year, a 37% fall, rival Airbus shipped 389 deliveries, up 28% on the same period last year.Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.“I am not the sort of person who travels business, but in this case I did because the next flight left 30 minutes later and I thought it would have some leverage in my being able to make it. I was the first to get off the plane and was told a connection ambassador would be on the ground to escort me, but in the event he was delayed by a couple of minutes. That, and the fact that I was carrying my own luggage were the two things that saved me. If I had checked it in, the gate wouldn’t have closed and the flight would have waited.”When he was told he would have to take the next flight three hours later, Mavropoulos was initially irritated.Waiting in the lounge, without access to the internet or TV, he did not find out what had happened to flight ET302 until much later. “I don’t know if it applied to the whole airport, but no one could get online and it was only as I was going to board the [second] flight at around 10.50am that one of the women said our manager wants to speak to you. It’s a matter of protocol, as you are the only passenger who did not board the earlier plane that went missing.”It was only then, and when he subsequently received a text from a friend in Athens relaying the news of the crash in detail, that reality began to dawn. “I realised how close it was and how randomly I was saved, and at the same time I was like imploding inside because it was just way too much,” he says. “Even if I was saved it was also a huge burden in my mind, knowing what had happened to everyone else. I felt the ground slipping away from under my feet. I knew instantly that I had to call my family, my mother, wife and daughter, the people I love, to relieve them of the burden of worrying.”Mavropoulos eventually flew to Nairobi later that day and attended the UN environment assembly. He kept himself busy meeting people, listening to lectures and giving talks.Since then he has also spent a great deal of time contemplating the role of chance in a person’s life. “I know we Greeks are given to philosophising, but I have spent a lot of time in recent days thinking how important randomness is in our daily lives and how we should respect it more than we do.“Often we speak about bad luck but we don’t so often acknowledge good luck and the integral part it plays in our lives … It might be the case that the only reason I was saved is to help uncover why everyone else on that plane died.”",'Saved by luck': the passenger who just missed flight ET302,2019-03-15/01:00:01+0000,antonis mavropoulos knows he is lucky alone among passengers booked on to ethiopian airlines flight et he

i thought it would have some leverage in my being able to make it i was the first to get off the plane and was told a connection ambassador would be on the ground to escort me but in the event he was

it more than we do often we speak about bad luck but we don t so often acknowledge good luck and the integral part it plays in our lives it might be the case that the only reason i was saved is to

"Boeing’s 737 Max 8 and 9 planes will remain grounded for weeks at a minimum, US politicians said on Thursday, as flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the crashed Ethiopian Airlines plane arrived in France.After a briefing with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), congressman Rick Larsen said the planes, which have been involved in two fatal crashes in the last five months, would be banned from flying “at least through April” while new software is installed and investigations continue.Investigators will begin analysing flight recorders from the Ethiopian Airlines plane wreckage on Friday, in an attempt to establish what caused the crash that has grounded Boeing’s 737 Max fleet worldwide.In a photo of the data recorder released by France’s bureau of civil aviation safety (BEA) the central part of the recorder appears intact, though the edge appears somewhat mangled. A BEA spokesman said it was unclear whether the data was retrievable.There is mounting anger in Ethiopia over the handling of the crash. In Addis Ababa, about 200 family members of crash victims left a briefing with Ethiopian Airlines officials, saying the carrier has not given them adequate information.Officials said they had opened a call-in centre that is open 18 hours a day to respond to questions, but relatives said they were not getting the answers they needed.Relatives arrived at the crash scene in Hejere, about 31 miles (50km) from Addis Ababa, some wailing or beating their chests as a bulldozer navigated piles of debris. Blue plastic sheeting covered the wreckage of the plane.The crash on Sunday, in which 157 people were killed minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa, was the second such calamity involving Boeing’s 737 Max in less than six months. A Lion Air jet crashed in Indonesia in October, also shortly after takeoff, killing all 189 people on board.Citing newly refined satellite data and evidence from the scene of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the FAA has suggested the possibility of a shared cause for the two crashes. After assessing that data, “it became clear to all parties that the track of the Ethiopian flight was very close and behaved very similarly to the Lion Air flight”, FAA administrator Daniel Elwell told reporters.But aviation experts cautioned that it was still too early to draw conclusions. “To my mind people are drawing optical conclusions at the moment,” said Robert Mann, aviation consultant and former airline executive. “We need to wait for the hard data from these readers.”One central question investigators will address is whether software known as MCAS used by the 737 Max to prevent stalling was central to the accident. Lion Air officials have said sensors on their crashed plane produced erroneous information on its last four flights, triggering an automatic nose-down command that the pilots were unable to overcome on its final flight.Ethiopian Airlines’ chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, said its pilots had received special training on how to deal with that problem. “In addition to the basic trainings given for 737 aircraft types, an additional training was given for the Max version,” Tewolde said. “After the Lion Air crash, questions were raised, so Boeing sent further instructions that it said pilots should know.”The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air.

"Donald Trump grounded Boeing’s 737 Max fleet on Wednesday, days after the second fatal crash involving the plane in five months led to governments around the world – but initially not the US – suspending their use of the plane. Boeing then decided to pull its entire fleet of 737 Maxes worldwide. What do we know about the crisis so far?There are fears the 737 Max model contains a potentially fatal safety flaw after it was involved in two crashes in the last five months that killed 346 people. On Sunday 10 March an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 model of the 737 aircraft was involved in a crash near Addis Ababa that killed all 157 people on board. In October a Max 8, operated by Lion Air, crashed into the sea near Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board. On Wednesday 13 March, Boeing said it would suspend its entire global fleet of all 371 models of the aircraft currently in operation, after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed a temporary ban on the model. Dozens of countries had already imposed bans earlier in the week.Announcing the bans, both the American and Canadian regulators cited new evidence to suggest a link between the two fatal crashes. Both crashes are still under investigation but preliminary satellite tracking data suggests they were caused by a faulty automated system designed to prevent the plane from stalling, known as MCAS.Marc Garneau, Canada’s transport minister, said the new data revealed “vertical variations” in the Ethiopian Airlines flight similar to those seen before the crash of the Lion Air flight.We still don’t know, but the data suggests it may have been activated on both flights. Experts speculate that malfunctioning sensor readings pushed the nose of the Lion Air flight downward. The pilots appeared to be struggling with the system as their repeated attempts to right the jet by pulling the nose up again appeared to be overridden by MCAS. The limited data so far available about the Ethiopian Airlines flight suggested a similar pattern of variations of altitude in 15 to 20 second bursts.The black box recorder has been recovered from the wreckage, which should reveal technical flight data as well as the cockpit voice recordings. Until that evidence is analysed and released, the only available data has come from tracking websites such as Flightradar24.Flight ET302 took off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, at 8.38am local time (5.38am GMT) and crashed approximately six minutes later, on its way to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, in rural land near the town of Bishoftu.According to the airline, the captain of the plane had reported difficulties and requested permission to turn back.Flight radar data shows that the aircraft was climbing erratically, with an unstable “vertical airspeed”, or height.Conflicting witness reports from locals on the ground have been given to TV crews. One man told the BBC that the plane had dropped straight from the sky, with no visible flames before impact; another told CNN that he had seen smoke coming from the back of the aircraft before it crashed.The undisputed similarity is that both planes that were the same model of Boeing 737: a new iteration, the Max 8, that first flew in 2017 and had only been in service a matter of months for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines; and in both cases, the pilots reported difficulties immediately after takeoff.While the investigation is still continuing into the Lion Air crash, the plane showed sharp changes of altitude, which suggested the pilots may have been effectively trying to wrestle against in-flight control systems designed to prevent a stall.The plane has become the fastest selling in history: more than 5,000 orders placed, and more than 350 in service. At its officially listed price ($121m per plane), that amounts to more than $600bn worth of planes sold already and being manufactured, though most airlines will have bought them at a substantial discount.Boeing’s 737 was already the most common plane in the sky, a short-haul workhorse. The latest iteration promised significantly greater fuel efficiency, more seats on a similar-sized plane, and a longer range – a promise that has seen airlines all around the world clamour to buy them. Ryanair alone has signed up for 150.Ethiopian has been regarded as a standard bearer among African airlines, on a continent where aviation safety has lagged behind the rest of the world. Despite Ethiopian Airlines’ mostly good record, a notable exemption was a crash in 2010 off Lebanon that killed 90 people and was ascribed to pilot error by investigators, although the airline disputed the findings.But it has not had great fortune as an early adopter of Boeing planes: an electrical fault saw a 787 Dreamliner catch fire at Heathrow in 2013.Despite initial claims from the US that the plane was safe, dozens of countries suspended operations of the aircraft in and out of their airports, and many airlines have said they are grounding their fleets.The European Union followed the UK, France, Austria, Germany, Ireland and Malaysia have suspended the operation of all 737 Max models in their airspace. Singapore, Australia and New Zealand’s regulators have suspended the operation of 737 Max planes flying into and out of the country. China’s regulator has ordered domestic airlines to suspend 737 Max 8 flights. India, Indonesia, South Korea and Oman have grounded their airlines’ 737 Max 8 jets for inspections.",Why has Boeing pulled its 737 Max fleet – and what took it so

"The pilot of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 told controllers he was having control problems before the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet crashed, according to an account of cockpit voice recordings from the airline’s chief executive.The pilot did not mention bird strikes or external problems, but requested permission to return to Bole airport in Addis Ababa within minutes of takeoff. The pilot “reported back to air traffic controllers that he was having flight control problems”, but cited no other issues, Tewolde GebreMariam told the Wall Street Journal.The airline is planning to send the plane’s flight data recorder to Europe rather than the US for analysis, he said.Flight 302 was bound for Nairobi when it plunged to the ground shortly after takeoff on Sunday, killing all 157 people onboard. It was the second crash involving the 737 Max 8 model in less than five months, after the Lion Air disaster off Indonesia, in which 189 people died in October.No evidence has yet linked the crashes, but pilots on both planes reported problems moments after takeoff and asked to make emergency landings.Canada’s transport minister announced on Wednesday that it would bar commercial 737 Max flights from its airspace, leaving the US virtually isolated in allowing the model to fly. Canada lost 18 of its citizens in the Ethiopia crash, the second highest number after Kenya.European regulators have already grounded the 737 Max, along with China, Australia, India and others around the world. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Boeing and US airlines continue to maintain the 737 Max is safe to fly.The decision by Canada, where Air Canada, WestJet and Sunwing Airlines operate 41 of the 737s, will further fuel pressure in the US on regulators to act.In response to public fears expressed about the plane, some travel booking websites such as Kayak are allowing customers to exclude the aircraft types from searches, as nervous passengers seek alternative flights.It has emerged pilots on at least two US flights last year filed safety concerns about the aircraft after its nose tilted down suddenly when they engaged the autopilot.The pilots’ reports were filed in a database compiled by Nasa that does not reveal the airlines or locations.On one flight, the co-pilot said the nose pitched downward and the plane began descending at 1,200 to 1,500ft a minute before the captain disconnected the autopilot.Another pilot complained Boeing had not explained changes to the plane’s automatic functions, describing the flight manual as “inadequate and almost criminally insufficient”.The FAA said it was continuing to review all data from operators and pilots, but the review so far showed “no systematic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft. Nor have other civil aviation authorities provided data to us that would warrant action.”In the US, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines operate the Max 8, and United Airlines flies a slightly larger version, the Max 9. All three carriers vouched for the safety of Max aircraft on Wednesday.US crew unions, however, have called for the planes to be grounded, and politicians at the highest level, including the president, Donald Trump, have aired doubts.Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are........needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!The Republican senator Ted Cruz, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that oversees aviation, said it would be prudent for the US to temporarily ground the aircraft “until the FAA confirms the safety of these aircraft and their passengers”.Boeing said: “We understand that regulatory agencies and customers have made decisions that they believe are most appropriate for their home markets. We’ll continue to engage with them to ensure they have the information needed to have confidence in operating their fleets.”The manufacturer is to face a slew of compensation claims from airlines around the world whose 737 Max fleets have been grounded.Norwegian said it would be pursuing the US manufacturer for costs and lost revenue after being forced to take 18 planes out of service, as the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK and the European Aviation Safety Agency banned the Max 8. Dozens of flights have been cancelled at the airline, which is already in a precarious financial situation. Norwegian told Reuters: “We expect Boeing to take this bill.”The airline, which has been operating low-cost transatlantic flights as well as short-haul using the single-aisle Max 8, has orders that will quadruple its fleet of the planes by 2021. Norwegian’s share price fell 10% this week following the crash.Analysts said the situation would become serious for Norwegian if it persisted into the peak Easter season, when demand would mean there was no spare capacity. Many other airlines have schedules planned around deliveries of the 737 Max, which could be affected by a prolonged grounding. Ryanair expects the first of 135 Max 200s to be delivered in the spring, with more than 50 due in service by summer 2020.Meanwhile, Germany’s Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation said it would not analyse the black box from the Ethiopian Airlines jet.“This is a new type of aircraft with a new black box, with new software. We can’t do it,” said the BFU spokesman Germout Freitag.A spokesman for Ethiopian Airlines had earlier said the black boxes recovered from the crashed plane would be sent to Germany for analysis.",Ethiopian Airlines pilot 'reported flight control problems before crash',2019-03-13/13:10:37+0000,the pilot of ethiopian airlines flight  told controllers he was having control problems

"Boeing and the US aviation authorities have come under increasing pressure to ground the 737 Max despite repeated reassurances as the European Union and numerous other countries halted flights and Donald Trump weighed in following a second fatal crash involving the plane in less than five months.US regulators, airlines and the manufacturer have become increasingly isolated in maintaining that the plane is safe. On Wednesday, India’s aviation ministry said the planes would be grounded immediately and New Zealand suspended operation of the plane due to the “level of uncertainty” about the cause of the recent Ethiopian Airlines crash. Malaysia also temporarily banned the plane from their airspace, and Fiji Airways became the latest carrier to stop using the aircraft.Norwegian Air said it expected compensation from Boeing for being forced to ground its planes, Reuters reported on Wednesday morning.Daniel K Elwell, the acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, said on Tuesday it “continues to review extensively all available data and aggregate safety performance from operators and pilots of the Boing 737 Max. Thus far, our review shows no systematic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft. Nor have other civil aviation authorities provided data to us that would warrant action.”Boeing, meanwhile, reiterated its support for the 737 Max, saying it had “full confidence” in its safety.However, the global reaction to Sunday’s fatal crash involving an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max is adding pressure on the company and the Federal Aviation Administration to act.At least 27 airlines have grounded the Max and more than half of the 350 aircraft in service have been withdrawn from use.Pilots of at least two US flights have complained that their new Boeing jet pointed its nose down automatically.Trump said on Tuesday that modern planes were “becoming far too complex to fly”.The Association of Professional Flight Attendants called on American Airlines to ground its 737 Max fleet pending further investigation.The EU’s aviation safety agency, EASA, suspended all flights by Boeing’s 737-8 and 737-9 models after the UK, Ireland, Germany, France and other countries made similar moves.Explaining the UK’s decision to ban the planes, a spokesman for the British Civil Aviation Authority said: “As we do not currently have sufficient information from the flight data recorder we have, as a precautionary measure, issued instructions to stop any commercial passenger flights from any operator arriving, departing or overflying UK airspace.”The British pilots’ union, Balpa, welcomed the decision, saying: “Safety must come first.”Boeing said: “We understand that regulatory agencies and customers have made decisions that they believe are most appropriate for their home markets. We’ll continue to engage with them to ensure they have the information needed to have confidence in operating their fleets.”Boeing plans to update the Max’s software and change flight controls and training guidelines.There are five 737 Max aircraft registered and operational in the UK, all belonging to TUI. Norwegian has also grounded all its 18 737 Max 8 planes, registered across Europe, including several which it uses to operate transatlantic flights from Edinburgh and Ireland to the US.Turkish Airlines also operates 737 Max 8 planes. Two of its flights bound for Britain appear to have been forced to turn back to Istanbul in midair, according to FlightRadar24.TUI, the world’s largest travel and tourism company, said it would stop using the 737 Max across all six airlines in its group.Earlier on Tuesday, Australia and Singapore suspended operations of all Boeing 737 Max aircraft in and out of their airports, after Indonesia and China grounded their fleets of the Max 8. Oman and South Korea have also followed suit. Nearly 40% of the in-service fleet of 371 Max jets globally have been grounded, according to the industry publication Flightglobal, including 97 jets in the biggest market, China.In the US, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines operate the Max 8, and United Airlines flies a slightly larger version, the Max 9. All three carriers vouched for the safety of Max aircraft on Wednesday.Two US airline pilots filed voluntary safety reports last year to a database compiled by Nasa, saying an automated system seemed to cause their 737 Max planes to tilt down suddenly.The pilots said that soon after engaging the autopilot on Max 8 planes, the nose tilted down sharply. In both cases, they recovered quickly after disconnecting the autopilot.The problem did not appear related to the automated anti-stall system that is suspected of contributing to a deadly October crash in Indonesia.The voluntary safety reports do not publicly reveal the names of pilots, the airlines or the location of the incidents. It was also unclear whether the accounts led to any actions by the FAA or the pilots’ airlines. The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp dive into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane's black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines becomes the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.In the wake of Boeing’s troubles, Airbus seems set to overtake it as the world's biggest planemaker. As Boeing reported 239 commercial plane deliveries in the first half of the year, a 37% fall, rival Airbus shipped 389 deliveries, up 28% on the same period last year.Pictures emerge of a Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair with the name 737 Max replaced by 737-8200 on the nose.An Ethiopian Airlines passenger jet plunged to the ground shortly after takeoff on Sunday, killing all 157 people onboard. The same model was involved in the Lion Air crash off Indonesia that killed 189 people in October. No evidence has emerged to link the two incidents, but in both cases pilots reported problems with the plane and requested permission to make an emergency landing before losing contact with ground control.The plane’s black box recorders, containing flight data and cockpit voice recordings, have been recovered and could potentially provide some indication of the causes within days, depending on their condition.The scare has wiped billions of dollars off the market value of the world’s biggest plane-maker.Boeing’s stock fell further on Tuesday as international regulators moved against the 737 Max, and is unlikely to have been boosted by Trump’s intervention on Twitter.The president said manufacturers were “always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain.”He added: “I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!”Following his tweet, Trump met Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, in the first known conversation between them since the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash.Airlines using the Max 8 have been inundated with questions from concerned passengers since Sunday’s crash, many demanding to know which type of aircraft they will be taking – and their right to cancel based on that.“It’s not 100% clear, but if you were at the airport and there were other flights not on a Max, a customer is likely to be accommodated asking to switch to another flight even though it’s not clearly provided for in published rules,” said John Cox, the founder and chief executive of Safety Operating Systems.The Association of Professional Flight Attendants president, Lori Bassani, said the Max should be grounded. “The safety of our crews and passengers is paramount. Our flight attendants will not be forced to fly if they feel unsafe,” she said.On Monday, the FAA noted that external reports were drawing similarities between the crashes in Ethiopia and off Indonesia. It said the Boeing 737 Max 8 was airworthy but that it had demanded design changes to the aircraft by April.The US transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said regulators would not hesitate to act if they found a safety issue. Boeing’s top executive told employees on Monday he was confident in the safety of the 737 Max, its top-selling aircraft. Industry analysts said some disruption was inevitable from airlines grounding their 737 Max 8s, even though most of those who have done so have a small number of the planes in operation compared with their overall fleet size.The aviation consultant John Strickland said cancellations were likely, adding that while there could be more planes on standby in quieter midweek or off-season periods, an ongoing grounding would cause headaches for airlines awaiting deliveries of 737 Max planes from Boeing: “Ryanair, for example, is expecting 50 in the next few months.”Reuters contributed to this

"Why do airlines love the Boeing 737 Max? In a word: money.This is a plane that promised to cut fuel and maintenance bills, fly further and cram in more passengers – manna to airline executives and shareholders.More than 5,000 of the new Max planes have been ordered, mostly the Max 8 iteration, allowing Boeing to maintain the 737’s historic chart-topping sales in the face of competition from the Airbus A320 family’s latest “neo” planes.While both manufacturers have launched more daring ventures with greater fanfare and mixed fortunes – Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and the A380 superjumbo from Airbus – the Max was something else: a plane that didn’t rip up the model, but more or less matched the familiar, shorthaul workhorse. It replicated what airlines had already got, only better, lighter, and cheaper to fuel and maintain.Buyers queued from every continent. In the UK, even the doomed Monarch ordered dozens, though the airline couldn’t quite hang on long enough to reap the forecasted annual savings of up to £3m a plane.At a relatively affordable price, the Max – a single-aisle plane – had a flying range that opened up the possibility of using it on long-haul corridors traditionally the preserve of wide-body jetliners – an opportunity taken by Norwegian to fly new routes across the Atlantic.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air.

"An Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday near Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board. Here’s what we know about the crash.The black box recorder has been recovered from the wreckage, which should reveal technical flight data as well as the cockpit voice recordings. Until that evidence is analysed and released, the only available data has come from tracking websites such as Flightradar24.Flight ET302 took off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, at 8.38am local time (5.38am GMT) and crashed approximately six minutes later, on its way to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, in rural land near the town of Bishoftu.According to the airline, the captain of the plane had reported difficulties and requested permission to turn back.Flight radar data shows that the aircraft was climbing erratically, with an unstable vertical airspeed.Conflicting witness reports from locals on the ground have been given to TV crews. One man told the BBC that the plane had dropped straight from the sky, with no visible flames before impact; another told CNN that he had seen smoke coming from the back of the aircraft before it crashed.The disaster was the second involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in the past four months. In October, a Lion Air plane crashed into the sea off the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, killing all 189 people onboard.The undisputed similarity is that both planes that were the same model of Boeing 737: a new iteration, the Max 8, that first flew in 2017 and had only been in service a matter of months for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines; and in both cases, the pilots reported difficulties immediately after takeoff.While the investigation is still continuing into the Lion Air crash, the plane showed sharp changes of altitude, which suggested the pilots may have been effectively trying to wrestle against in-flight control systems designed to prevent a stall.However, the publicity around that crash and immediate warnings to airlines and pilots from Boeing and aviation regulators, highlighting the software changes in the 737 Max autopilot and reminding pilots of operational procedures, would appear to make it unlikely that crew would be unaware if the same issue arose.The plane has become the fastest selling in history: more than 5,000 orders placed, and more than 350 in service. At its officially listed price ($121m per plane), that amounts to more than $600bn worth of planes sold already and being manufactured, though most airlines will have bought them at a substantial discount.Boeing’s 737 was already the most common plane in the sky, a short-haul workhorse.

"The aircraft manufacturer Boeing faces further questions over the safety of its 737 Max 8 jets as Ethiopian Airlines joined carriers in China and elsewhere in grounding the planes after their second fatal crash in months.The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder have been recovered from the wreckage of Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302, which crashed on Sunday killing all 157 people onboard.Investigators will hope the black box evidence can explain why the plane crashed six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa en route to Nairobi, ploughing into a field near Tulu Fara village outside the town of Bishoftu, 40 miles (65km) south-east of the Ethiopian capital.Witnesses on the ground have given conflicting accounts of the plane’s final moments. One man who spoke to the BBC said the aircraft fell sharply with no apparent damage prior to impact. However, Malka Galato, a farmer on whose land the plane crashed, told Reuters he saw “papers falling off” and “smoke and sparks coming from the back” as it turned close to the ground.Boeing’s shares fell 13% within minutes of Wall Street opening on Monday morning and ended the day down just over 5%.The US Federal Aviation Administration issued a “continued airworthiness notification” for the Max on Monday evening. However, it later issued a notice to international carriers saying it would mandate forthcoming “design changes” to the aircraft from Boeing by April. More than 300 Boeing 737 Max planes are in operation and more than 5,000 have been ordered worldwide since 2017.The disaster was the second involving the 737 Max 8 in the past five months. In October a Lion Air plane crashed into the sea off the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, killing all 189 people onboard.On Monday the UK Foreign Office said at least nine Britons were among the dead in Ethiopia. Officials had originally put the British death toll at seven, but later learned at least two more dual nationals than previously thought were travelling on their non-UK passports.“Our staff at the British embassy in Addis Ababa are continuing to work with the relevant authorities in Ethiopia to obtain further information. We extend our deepest condolences to all those who have lost loved ones and those affected by this tragic event,” a spokesman said.Aviation experts, Chinese regulators, and concerned passengers highlighted the fact the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes involved models that had been in service for only a short time.Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the US transportation department, told CNN the latest disaster was “highly suspicious” and “rings alarm bells in the aviation industry, because that just doesn’t happen”. She said Boeing should “take the lead” in telling airlines to ground the plane.US carriers that operate the aircraft, including Southwest and American Airlines, attempted to reassure customers worried by the crash.Provisional flight data from the tracking website FlightRadar24 suggested ET302 climbed erratically in the short time it was in the air. The pilot of the plane, as in the Lion Air case, reported difficulties to air traffic controllers quickly after takeoff and requested permission to turn back, Ethiopian Airlines said.The airline, Africa’s largest carrier, announced it would be taking its 737 Max planes out of service. Earlier on Monday, China’s civil aviation administration ordered the country’s airlines to ground the jets “in view of the fact that the two air crashes were newly delivered Boeing 737 [Max] 8 aircraft” and had “certain similarities”.Approximately 60 of the 737 Max planes have been delivered to about a dozen Chinese airlines since the aircraft was released. Indonesia’s aviation authorities said all 737 Max jets would be temporarily grounded. Indonesia’s main carrier, Garuda, as well as Lion Air, operates the new model.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights.

The Cayman Airways president and chief executive, Fabian Whorms, said the airline was “putting the safety of our passengers and crew first”.India’s aviation regulator issued new rules on Monday stating only pilots with more than 1,000 hours of training could operate the Boeing 737 Max 8.Passengers on British Airways flights in Africa could be flying on the same model, with the first of eight new 737 Max 8 planes having come into service last month.Comair, which operates British Airways flights in Africa, announced on Monday it has decided to pause flying the first of eight new 737 Max 8 planes it has ordered, that came into service last month.Although BA does not operate Max 8s in its fleet, it franchises Comair to fly from Johannesburg to destinations around southern Africa, including Zimbabwe and Mozambique.The holiday operator Tui Airways ordered 32 Max aircraft as part of a fleet overhaul and took delivery of its first Max 8 in December. Tui was the first UK-registered airline to receive one of the new Boeings and it plans to roll out its orders over the next five years.Several airlines said they did not intend to ground their flights, including Fiji Airways which said it had “full confidence in the airworthiness of our fleet”. Singapore Airlines, which has five Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft in the fleet of its regional carrier SilkAir, and a further 31 on firm order, said it had not grounded the aircraft and was “continuing to monitor the situation closely”.Other airlines that have ordered the same model but are yet to receive delivery of them, including Virgin Australia and Air Niugini, said they had no plans to alter their order and it was too early to comment at this stage.Boeing said it was cancelling an event scheduled for Wednesday in Seattle to showcase its new 777X airliner.The victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash came from at least 32 countries. The largest number were from Kenya. Among the dead were 22 UN staff, many heading for an assembly of the UN Environment Programme in Nairobi.At the opening of the assembly on Monday morning, delegates paid their respects with a moment of silence for the victims. “We have lost fellow delegates, interpreters and UN staff,” said the president of the assembly, Siim Kiisler. “I express my condolences to those who lost loved ones in the

"Aviation authorities have begun investigating how a new Boeing plane with an experienced pilot crashed minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board.The destruction of Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 302, which was on its way to Nairobi, is the second calamity involving a Boeing 737 Max 8, a new model that experienced a similar accident in Indonesia in October.The largest number of the victims were Kenyans. At least seven Britons were on the flight, which left Bole airport at 8.38am local time (5.38am GMT).At least 19 people affiliated with the United Nations were among those killed, according to the UN migration agency chief. Many were delegates on their way to the UN environment assembly, which starts in Nairobi on Monday. Eighteen Canadians also died.The pilot said he was experiencing technical problems and asked to return to the airport. The control tower lost contact with the aircraft at 8.44am. Wreckage was later discovered near the town of Bishoftu, 39 miles (62km) south-east of the Ethiopian capital.The flight tracking website Flightradar24 tweeted that the plane had unstable vertical speed after takeoff.The cause of the accident is not yet known. The Ethiopian Airlines chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, said routine maintenance had revealed no problems with the plane, and the captain Yared Getachew had flown more than 8,000 hours with an “excellent flying record”. The airline took delivery of the plane in November.“As I said, it is a brand new airplane with no technical remarks, flown by a senior pilot and there is no cause that we can attribute at this time,” he told reporters.Questions have been raised about the safety of the Boeing 737 Max 8, which has been in commercial operation since 2016. The same model was involved in the Lion Air crash, where a jet plunged into the Java Sea soon after takeoff last year, killing 189 people.More than 300 of these planes are in operation with different airlines. Ethiopian has six more. Asked whether they would be grounded, GebreMariam said no because “we don’t know the cause of the accident”.Several airlines around the world fly the 737 Max 8. On Sunday night reports said China had asked its local airlines to temporarily ground the planes.In a statement, the airline said it would conduct a forensic investigation in conjunction with officials from Boeing, the Ethiopian civil aviation authority, the Ethiopian transport authority other international bodies.The plane was carrying passengers from more than 30 nationalities. According to the airline, Kenya had 32, Canada 18, Ethiopia nine, Italy, China and the US eight each, the UK and France seven each, Egypt six, the Netherlands five, India and Slovakia four each, Sweden and Russia three each and other countries one or two.Sebastiano Tusa, 66, a renowned Italian archaeologist, was among those killed, the Italian government said. He had been flying to Kenya for a project with Unesco.A Slovakian MP, Anton Hrnko, wrote on Facebook that his wife, son and daughter had all been killed in the crash. “It is with deep sorrow that I announce that my dear wife, Blanka, son Martin and daughter Michala, died in the air disaster in Addis Ababa this morning.”Kenyan authorities offered support to families and friends waiting at Nairobi airport. The transport secretary, James Macharia, said they would be transported to an emergency centre at a nearby hotel. “It is a very sensitive emotional matter,” he said. Earlier many people had been waiting at the arrival gate with no information.“We’re just waiting for my mum. We’re just hoping she took a different flight or was delayed. She’s not picking up her phone,” said Wendy Otieno.Robert Mudanta, 46, was waiting for his brother-in-law coming from Canada. “We haven’t seen anyone from the airline or the airport,” he told Reuters more than three hours after the flight was lost. “Nobody has told us anything. We are just standing here hoping for the best.”Four of those on board were travelling on UN passports. . “Early indications are that 19 staff members of UN affiliated organizations perished,” said International Organization for Migration head Antonio Vitorino.“Numerous other staff members from at least five UN and affiliated organizations are understood to have also perished,” he said.Inger Anderson, the incoming head of UN environment, told the Guardian: “We’re devastated by what transpired. Obviously many of our partners and colleagues are deeply impacted. This is a house in mourning but a house that doesn’t yet know all the facts.” The assembly’s organisers have shared details of emergency hotlines with delegates.Several prominent humanitarian workers were among the victims, including International Committee for the Development of Peoples founder Paolo Dieci; three members of Italian humanitarian organisation Africa Tremila, including the president Carlo Spini, his wife, and treasurer Matteo Ravasio; and Save the Children child protection in emergencies adviser Tamirat Mulu Demessie.The Ethiopian prime minister’s office sent condolences via Twitter to the families of those lost in the crash.Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, said the crash was “devastating”.Under international rules, responsibility for leading the crash investigation lies with Ethiopia but the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will also participate because the plane was designed and built in the United States.Representatives of Boeing and Cincinnati-based engine-maker CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and the French company Safran, will advise the NTSB.The aircraft had shattered into many pieces and was severely burnt, a Reuters reporter at the scene of the crash said. Clothing and personal effects were scattered widely over the field where the plane came down.An eyewitness told AFP the plane came down in flames. “The plane was already on fire when it crashed to the ground. The crash caused a big explosion,” Tegegn Dechasa recounted at the site. “I was near the river near the crash site. Shortly after the crash police and a fire crew from a nearby air force camp came and extinguished the plane’s flames on the ground.”He added: “The plane was in flames in its rear side shortly before the crash. The plane was swerving erratically before the crash.”The cause of the earlier crash involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia is still under investigation. A preliminary report focused on airline maintenance and training, as well as the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor, but did not give a reason for the crash. Since then, the cockpit voice recorder was recovered and a final report is due later this year.State-owned Ethiopian is one of the biggest carriers in Africa by fleet size. It said previously that it expected to carry 10.6 million passengers last year. Its last major crash was in January 2010, when a flight from Beirut went down shortly after takeoff.The airline is in the middle of an expansion, aiming to double its fleet to 120 and become Africa’s biggest airline by 2025. It has tripled its passenger numbers over the past decade. A new terminal recently opened at Bole, tripling the airport’s size.Additional reporting by Lorenzo Tondo",Ethiopian Airlines crash: inquiry to explore how 'excellent' pilot was unable to avert

"The crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi is a tragedy that threatens to leave fresh questions hanging over the aircraft manufacturer Boeing.Few details about the crash are yet available, but according to Ethiopian Airlines the pilot, who was experienced with an excellent flying record, reported difficulties and asked to turn back.Africa’s aviation safety record has never been good, though Ethiopian has been regarded as an exception. Technical experts from Boeing are standing by for an international investigation into a crash that involved passengers from at least 32 countries.The Boeing 737 MAX 8, a brand new plane only registered in November, disappeared from the radar six minutes into the flight. Immediate comparisons have been drawn with Lion Air flight 610, which crashed just over four months ago, killing 189 people.

"Airbus has announced it will end production of its A380 superjumbo passenger jet after failing to secure orders – a move that puts UK jobs at risk.The European aerospace group said it had made the “painful” decision to stop making the world’s largest superjumbo in 2021 after Emirates, the A380’s biggest customer, reduced an outstanding order for 53 planes to only 14.Emirates will instead order 70 of the smaller A330 and A350 aircraft, underlining the trend towards smaller, more efficient aircraft that made the A380 unsustainable.The cancellation of the A380 will affect the jobs of as many as 3,500 Airbus staff, including about 300 at its factory in Broughton, north Wales, which constructs the model’s wings.The Broughton site has about 6,000 employees, while there are another 3,000 in Filton, near Bristol; some of whom work on landing gear and fuel systems for the A380. However, Airbus said a “significant number” of staff will move to production of other, more popular models and major job losses in the UK are not expected as a result of the announcement.Rhys McCarthy, the national officer for aerospace at Unite, said the union is seeking assurances from Airbus that there will be no job losses. He added that companies in the A380 supply chain, including Redditch-based GKN, are a “key concern”.Tom Enders, Airbus’s outgoing chief executive, said the cancellation was “painful for us”. He said: “We have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years.”Speaking at Airbus’s headquarters in Toulouse, France, Enders said the effect on jobs in the UK “needs to be evaluated”. He said: “Hopefully we can reuse and redeploy a significant number of employees there.“What we’re seeing here is the end of the large, four-engine aircraft,” said Enders, who admitted that the company was a decade late in developing the superjumbo. Boeing, Airbus’s American arch-rival, this month celebrated 50 years of production of its 747.Engines for the A380 are produced in Derby by Rolls-Royce, another major British aerospace employer, although it is thought that the effect on UK jobs numbers will be small.In a statement, Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce’s civil aerospace president, said: “The A380 is a world-class feat of engineering, much loved by passengers, and we are obviously saddened that deliveries will come to an end.”Airbus said that more than 190 million passengers have flown in the A380 since the first plane rolled off the assembly line in Toulouse, France, in 2007. However, the plane, which can theoretically carry as many as 800 passengers, has struggled for profitability as demand for mid-sized jets boomed.Airbus, which on Thursday also announced stronger than expected profits for 2018, is planning to ramp up production of its smaller models even as the A380 winds down. It is targeting between 880 and 890 deliveries of aircraft to its customers during 2019, a 10% increase from its record haul of 800 in 2018.However, the A380 cancellation will add another element of uncertainty for the future of UK operations already threatened by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Enders last month decried “Brexiteers’ madness”, saying that future investment decisions would be influenced if Brexit led to significant trade frictions.Enders on Thursday said he believed the “voices of reason” would prevail, avoiding a no-deal Brexit. In June last year Airbus said there would be a cost of €1bn (about £880m) for every week of delay in production. The company and its suppliers have built up buffer stocks of about €1bn, in line with estimates made in June.Enders said: “Looking at the situation as it is I’m still optimistic that a solution can be found that avoids a fall from a cliff.”The end of the A380 may free up space at Airbus’s Toulouse and Hamburg facilities, where final assembly is currently carried out, giving them a boost in the competition for business with the UK. However, Enders denied reports that Spain had made a formal offer to take wing production from the UK after Brexit.The end of the A380 comes at a crucial time for Airbus as it takes on a new leadership team after losing out to Boeing in the aircraft deliveries race in 2018. Guillaume Faury, a former helicopter engineer who became the president of Airbus’s commercial aircraft business in February 2018, will take over from Enders as chief executive in April.Faury said the risks from Brexit were “enormous” in both the short and long term, with the principal risk to Airbus coming in delays at the UK’s border with the rest of the EU.",A380: Airbus to stop making superjumbo as orders dry up,2019-02-14/11:49:05+0000,airbus has announced it will end production of its a superjumbo passenger jet after failing to secure orders a move that puts uk jobs at risk the european aerospace group said it had made the painful decision to stop making the world s largest superjumbo in  after emirates the a s biggest customer reduced an outstanding order for  planes to only  emirates will instead order  of the smaller a and a aircraft underlining the trend towards smaller more efficient aircraft that made the a unsustainable the cancellation of the a will affect the jobs of as many as   airbus staff including about  at its factory in broughton north wales which constructs the model s wings the broughton site has about   employees while there are another   in filton near bristol some of whom work on landing gear and fuel systems for the a however airbus said a significant number of staff will move to production of other more popular models and major job losses in the uk are not expected as a result of the announcement rhys mccarthy the national officer for aerospace at unite said the union is seeking assurances from airbus that there will be no job losses he added that companies in the a supply chain including redditch based gkn are a key concern tom enders airbus s outgoing chief executive said the cancellation was painful for us he said we have no substantial a backlog and hence no basis to sustain production despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years speaking at airbus s headquarters in toulouse france enders said the effect on jobs in the uk needs to be evaluated he said hopefully we can reuse and redeploy a significant number of employees there what we re seeing here is the end of the large four engine aircraft said enders who admitted that the company was a decade late in developing the superjumbo boeing airbus s american arch rival this month celebrated  years of production of its  engines for the a are produced in derby by rolls royce another major british aerospace employer although it is thought that the effect on uk jobs numbers will be small in a statement chris cholerton rolls royce s civil aerospace president said the a is a world class feat of engineering much loved by passengers and we are obviously saddened that deliveries will come to an end airbus said that more than  million passengers have flown in the a since the first plane rolled off the assembly line in toulouse france in  however the plane which can theoretically carry as many as  passengers has struggled for profitability as demand for mid sized jets boomed airbus which on thursday also announced stronger than expected profits for  is planning to ramp up production of its smaller models even as the a winds down it is targeting between  and  deliveries of aircraft to its customers during  a  increase from its record haul of  in  however the a cancellation will add another element of uncertainty for the future of uk operations already threatened by the prospect of a no deal brexit enders last month decried brexiteers madness saying that future investment decisions would be influenced if brexit led to significant trade frictions enders on thursday said he believed the voices of reason would prevail avoiding a no deal brexit in june last year airbus said there would be a cost of bn about m for every week of delay in production the company and its suppliers have built up buffer stocks of about bn in line with estimates made in june enders said looking at the situation as it is i m still optimistic that a solution can be found that avoids a fall from a cliff the end of the a may free up space at airbus s toulouse and hamburg facilities where final assembly is currently carried out giving them a boost in the competition for business with the uk however enders denied reports that spain had made a formal offer to take wing production from the uk after brexit the end of the a comes at a crucial time for airbus as it takes on a new leadership team after losing out to boeing in the aircraft deliveries race in  guillaume faury a former helicopter engineer who became the president of airbus s commercial aircraft business in february  will take over from enders as chief executive in april faury said the risks from brexit were enormous in both the short and long term with the principal risk to airbus coming in delays at the uk s border with the rest of the eu ,Boeing Crisis,0.234309912
"Looking at a plane this enormous, it felt a miracle that it could fly. And not only fly but soar so quietly, especially compared with the Boeing 747 it was designed to supersede and outclass. Passengers love it, but the A380 never completely took off among the airline buyers.The announcement from Airbus that the final curtain will come down on the A380’s pan-European production line comes after years of speculation that the superjumbo was doomed. Orders had dried up in a risk-averse airline industry, whose economics and route networks were altered just at the wrong moment for the A380.Airbus had nosed ahead of the pack in producing a plane that was built with lighter materials and was much more fuel-efficient, and potentially offered big savings and profits on routes where airlines could guarantee to load hundreds of passengers on every flight. It looked an ideal solution for the packed transatlantic corridors, where airlines would compete for scarce and expensive slots at intercontinental hubs such as Heathrow.Even as the first A380 entered service in 2007, however, orders were piling up for a different plane still in the pipeline from rival Boeing. The 787 Dreamliner could fly a similar range on only two engines. This upstart took the use of lightweight composite materials a leap further and would need roughly half the number of passengers, 250 to 300 rather than the typical 550 on an A380, to make long-haul flights economically viable.The hub and spokes model of aviation, in which airlines feed in passengers from connecting flights, and the bigger the long-haul plane the better, was being challenged. Low-cost aviation had given secondary airports fresh life, and passengers were increasingly used to direct, point-to-point flying. The need for Airbus’s expensive double-decker, its wings so wide that airport stands and equipment had to be remodelled to accommodate it, was fading.The doubts escalated when so few customers were willing to take a punt on a plane whose future was in question. Only one airline, Emirates, appeared fully enamoured, placing giant orders that single-handedly sustained the A380 manufacturing programme. Few others had the deep pockets of the booming Gulf carrier, or customers rich enough to merit turning part of the plane’s spacious interior into a shower spa suite.British Airways talked up the plane’s qualities but talked down the price. The Australian carrier, Qantas, was stung by teething problems as an early adopter, stalled on an order made in 2006 and finally cancelled it last week. Even Air France cut back on the plane assembled by its compatriots in Toulouse.The most ominous sign was the news that two of the first A380s, still in their infancy in aircraft years, were being parked in the Pyrenees and stripped for parts. The aircraft had gone from great birds of the sky to mere organ donors in a decade. It was a more economical solution for their owner, the German leasing firm Dr Peters, than trying to hire them out to unwilling airlines.When Emirates finally decided enough was enough, seeking to convert its order to newer, smaller models, it was game over. Few can blame Airbus for wanting to cling on and push this incredible plane, whose virtues are unquestioned. But the world it was built for has not materialised as Airbus had hoped.",Passengers loved it but the Airbus A380 never took off with buyers,2019-02-14/09:21:41+0000,looking at a plane this enormous it felt a miracle that it could fly and not only fly but soar so quietly especially compared with the boeing  it was designed to supersede and outclass passengers love it but the a never completely took off among the airline buyers the announcement from airbus that the final curtain will come down on the a s pan european production line comes after years of speculation that the superjumbo was doomed orders had dried up in a risk averse airline industry whose economics and route networks were altered just at the wrong moment for the a airbus had nosed ahead of the pack in producing a plane that was built with lighter materials and was much more fuel efficient and potentially offered big savings and profits on routes where airlines could guarantee to load hundreds of passengers on every flight it looked an ideal solution for the packed transatlantic corridors where airlines would compete for scarce and expensive slots at intercontinental hubs such as heathrow even as the first a entered service in  however orders were piling up for a different plane still in the pipeline from rival boeing the  dreamliner could fly a similar range on only two engines this upstart took the use of lightweight composite materials a leap further and would need roughly half the number of passengers  to  rather than the typical  on an a to make long haul flights economically viable the hub and spokes model of aviation in which airlines feed in passengers from connecting flights and the bigger the long haul plane the better was being challenged low cost aviation had given secondary airports fresh life and passengers were increasingly used to direct point to point flying the need for airbus s expensive double decker its wings so wide that airport stands and equipment had to be remodelled to accommodate it was fading the doubts escalated when so few customers were willing to take a punt on a plane whose future was in question only one airline emirates appeared fully enamoured placing giant orders that single handedly sustained the a manufacturing programme few others had the deep pockets of the booming gulf carrier or customers rich enough to merit turning part of the plane s spacious interior into a shower spa suite british airways talked up the plane s qualities but talked down the price the australian carrier qantas was stung by teething problems as an early adopter stalled on an order made in  and finally cancelled it last week even air france cut back on the plane assembled by its compatriots in toulouse the most ominous sign was the news that two of the first as still in their infancy in aircraft years were being parked in the pyrenees and stripped for parts the aircraft had gone from great birds of the sky to mere organ donors in a decade it was a more economical solution for their owner the german leasing firm dr peters than trying to hire them out to unwilling airlines when emirates finally decided enough was enough seeking to convert its order to newer smaller models it was game over few can blame airbus for wanting to cling on and push this incredible plane whose virtues are unquestioned but the world it was built for has not materialised as airbus had hoped ,Boeing Crisis,0.363538951
"Global aircraft production has fallen by a quarter after the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max jet following two fatal accidents.ADS, the British aerospace lobby group, said 88 aircraft were delivered in July, down 24% on the same month a year ago, with the fall largely due to the slump in production of single-aisled planes such as the 737. The number of aircraft delivered in the year to date has now reached 716 but that is more than 11% lower than in 2018.The ADS recently slashed its forecast for 2019 global aircraft deliveries from 1,789 to 1,489.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air.

"Qantas is to test non-stop direct flights from London to Sydney to see whether passengers and crew can tolerate what would be the world’s longest commercial flight at 19 hours.The Australian airline will carry 40 passengers and crew on two flights from New York to Sydney and another from London to Sydney.The test passengers on the flights this autumn will mainly be Qantas employees, as well as scientists, with no seats sold on the flights. Passengers and crew will be fitted with wearable technology devices to monitor sleep patterns and food and drink consumption, and to see how lighting, physical movement and inflight entertainment impact their health.Qantas aims to operate regular, non-stop flights to London and New York from Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as soon as 2022. The airline will make a decision on whether to introduce the ultra-long routes commercially by the end 2019.The airline, last year, launched direct flights between London and Perth, on the west coast of Australia, a 17-hour journey. However, the three most populous cities in Australia are all on the country’s east coast, and Melbourne is more than 10,300 miles from New York. London to Sydney is 10,500 miles.The test flights will use new Boeing 787-9 planes, with fewer passengers and less luggage than usual to extend the range. However, successful test flights would fire the starting gun on a race between the US firm Boeing and its European rival, Airbus, to sell Qantas their new ultra-long-range aircraft, the 777X and the A350 respectively.The A350 is currently in service on the world’s longest passenger flight: Singapore Airlines’s New York to Singapore slog, which covers 9,500 miles, taking 18 hours and 25 minutes.The proposed new routes reflect a trend in the airline industry to increase direct, long-distance flights, which are generally preferred by passengers. Alan Joyce, Qantas’s chief executive, said that flying a commercial airliner non-stop from New York to Sydney was “truly the final frontier in aviation”, reflecting the immense distances involved.Joyce said the start of the commercial flights on the routes was not a “foregone conclusion”, with questions remaining as to whether the routes would be profitable.“This is ultimately a business decision and the economics have to stack up,” Joyce said.No commercial airline has ever flown direct from New York to Australia, according to Qantas. It said it flew non-stop from London to Sydney in 1989 to mark the entry into service of the Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet, but with only 23 people on board in order to preserve fuel.The working patterns and health of crew will be a key determinant of the viability of the routes. Other ultra-long-haul services currently carry multiple crews who operate on four-hour shifts.Pilots will wear an electroencephalogram (EEG) device to track their brain activity and monitor alertness, so the airline can study the most effective rest pattern. Researchers from Melbourne’s Monash University will also record levels of melatonin – a chemical determining travellers’ experience of jet lag – before, during and after the flights.Qantas has already used its Perth to London route to test shift patterns. The airline will also test variations on food choices, separate areas for stretching and different entertainment options.Qantas, Australia’s flag carrier, has operated a service to Britain since 1938, using flying boats made by the UK company Short Brothers. In 1959, Qantas became the first non-American airline to take delivery of jet aircraft that enabled it to reach the US direct. However, until the Perth flight, travellers between the UK and Australia had to stop in airports such as Singapore or, more recently, Dubai.Aircraft manufacturers are getting better at making cabins habitable for extended periods of time, according to Dr Richard Dawood, a specialist in travel medicine at the Fleet Street Clinic.Modern planes using carbon-fibre construction can withstand higher air pressure inside the cabin, reducing the uncomfortable feeling of altitude that makes flyers’ ears pop. Humidity can be higher with fewer metal parts, reducing some of the discomfort associated with flying.Long-haul travel still takes its toll on the body, however. Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), blood clots that can form particularly in the legs, is one peril. Although it is rare in otherwise healthy people, it has led some airlines to consider allowing more space for passengers to move.“Sitting in any seat for 19 hours is something that carries an increased risk of thrombosis,” said Dawood. “It would be even more important than normal to get up, move around, stretch.”There is some evidence that irregular sleeping patterns have a negative effect on the health of shift workers, he added, making monitoring crew health even more important.There’s also jet lag, but no amount of clever design can prevent changing time zones from disrupting the body’s internal clock. Flying from west to east is worse because the body finds it harder to adapt to a shorter day than a longer one. Scientists are divided as to the effectiveness of melatonin supplements in fighting jet lag, while exposure to bright lights can help the body to adapt.• This article was amended on 23 August 2019. An earlier version said that modern planes using carbon-fibre construction “can withstand higher air pressure”. This has been clarified to refer to higher air pressure inside the cabin.

"The swift return of Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft to the skies was put further in doubt this week with airlines signalling that they do not hope to operate the plane any time soon.With more than four months already elapsed since the plane was grounded by regulators, Southwest and American, two of the jet’s main US operators, followed United Airlines in saying they would be taking the Max out of their schedules until November.Ryanair, Europe’s biggest short-haul carrier, also announced it would have to curb expansion plans pinned on the arrival of its 737 Max orders and that some airport bases would have to shut as a result.Making the announcement on Tuesday, its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said he remained committed to the plane: “We’ve described them as gamechangers – and they remain gamechangers.”But O’Leary admitted even its biggest customers – Ryanair has ordered 135 models – have little visibility on its immediate future: “We’re still operating in the realms of considerable uncertainty ... there are no guarantees.”According to one report, the 737 Max might not return until next year as Boeing searches to fix the design flaws behind two deadly crashes. Boeing’s top-selling plane, with around 5,000 on order worldwide, was pulled from service after an Ethiopian Airlines crash outside Addis Ababa in March that killed all 157 people on board. It was the 737 Max’s second disaster in five months, after 189 people were killed on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October.Elsewhere this week, it became clear that restoring trust among passengers could take longer than fixing the plane. In Washington, relatives of passengers who died in the Ethiopian disaster told Congressional hearings that Boeing had focused on profits “at the expense of human life”. In a blistering attack on the manufacturer and the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Paul Njoroge, who lost five family members including his wife and three children in the crash, warned that, without change, “another plane will dive to the ground, killing me, you”.Boeing released an initial $50m (£40m) in compensation for the bereaved on Wednesday, as part of a $100m fund it has set aside for victims’ families. The aerospace group also announced on Thursday it would take a $4.9bn charge reflecting the cost of compensation to airlines for schedule disruptions and a slowdown in production.Weeks of silence on the software issues at the centre of the crash investigations will worry airlines. Investigators are focusing on the 737 Max’s new anti-stall software, the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which was designed to keep the aircraft stable in flight. In both cases they suspect that the MCAS software – which automatically pushes the aircraft’s nose down to guard against a loss of lift – was activated by erroneous data from a single sensor. This forced the aircraft into dives that the pilots, ultimately, could not stop.In the wake of the Lion Air crash in October, Boeing started work on a fix. But in late June, when Boeing and the FAA appeared to be reaching a conclusion, they instead revealed a second flaw had been discovered, beyond MCAS. It was another “potential source of uncommanded stabiliser motion”. Or, another way the plane’s computers might battle unwitting pilots in the cockpit, should it think its nose would be better pointing down.According to the global airline body, Iata, restoring the plane to service would take another five weeks from regulatory approval by the FAA. Boeing hopes to present its full bid for recertification in September, but the US carriers’ rescheduling moves show they do not envisage an immediate sign-off.Approval is likely to be checked by non-US regulators, virtually all of whom grounded the plane before the FAA. That schism caused profound concern in the aviation industry and the FAA is unlikely to go it alone now. Iata, which hosted a summit to urge regulators to align, warned that aviation relied on “mutual recognition, trust, and reciprocity among safety regulators ... Restoring public confidence demands it.”Retraining 737 Max pilots is another moot question. The Max was sold as an upgrade to the existing, bestselling 737, rather than as a new type: removing the expense of extra training, beyond a short iPad session. Many pilots doubt this was enough – redoubled since the Ethiopian crash, where flight crew had followed Boeing’s instructions and reminders after the Lion Air disaster. Should Boeing and the FAA decide it necessary to refer Max pilots to simulators – even as a confidence-restoring measure – further delays would ensue. This would hit early adopters such as Norwegian, who are deep in the red and desperate for the economies the Max would bring.Some have more radical suggestions. Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and former US presidential candidate, whose grand-niece Samya Stumo died in the Ethiopia crash, has demanded a full, transparent review of the aircraft before recertification. He says the review should be overseen by a public panel including victims’ families, pilots, cabin crew and mechanics, as well as the FAA experts.Some think the plane may never fly again – at least as the Max. Donald Trump has already tweeted a suggestion to change the name. Boeing executives at June’s Paris Air Show appeared to consider a rebrand, but the idea was slapped down by the boss. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said he did not “see the need”, adding: “This is not a marketing or branding exercise. Certainly it impacts the public view, but the most important thing is safety.”Yet a Ryanair Max 200 emerging from the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, this week had the designation “737-8200” on the nose cone, instead of the 737 Max seen on other planes. Who oversaw the paint job remains a mystery. Boeing indicated it was a question for Ryanair, but O’Leary later said it was “nothing to do with us ... We just put the names and a big Ryanair on them.”O’Leary does not anticipate customer concerns when the planes are certified and delivered, pointing to the example of the 787 Dreamliner. The 787 was temporarily grounded due to safety concerns in 2013 but is now popular with the public, he said. Likewise, the Max “will be warmly welcomed by passengers who fly on them”.O’Leary added: “The [Max 737] operating costs are phenomenal; the fuel consumption, and additional revenue opportunity, while still operating with only four cabin crew,. If Boeing could deliver them tomorrow, we’d take them.”",Boeing Max 737: airlines delay plane's return until November,2019-07-19/17:59:01,the swift return of boeing s  max aircraft to the skies was

"A father whose five family members, including three children, died when a Boeing 737 Max jet crashed in Ethiopia in March, accused the company of “utter prejudice and disrespect” and warned there would be more deaths unless action is taken.Paul Njoroge’s wife, mother-in-law and three young children died when Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed on 10 March, shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. All 157 passengers and crew members aboard were killed.The congressional hearing in Washington at which Njoroge spoke comes in the wake of two fatal crashes involving Boeing 737 Maxes that killed 346 people and which have triggered investigations and lawsuits around the world.In blistering testimony, Njoroge said Boeing’s focus on share price and profits “at the expense of the safety of human life” and its cosy relationship with its US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), had led to the two crashes and cost him his family.In prepared notes, Njoroge wrote: “I miss their laughter, their playfulness, their touch. I am empty. I feel that I should have been on that plane with them. My life has no meaning. It is difficult for me to think of anything else but the horror they must have felt. I cannot get it out of my mind.”Unless Boeing’s conduct is addressed “another plane will dive to the ground killing me, you”, Njoroge told Congress.Njoroge said Boeing had moved to blame “foreign pilots” after a Lion Air 737 Max crashed into the Java Sea in October 2018. He said Boeing’s insinuation of pilot error allowed it to keep flying the plane – and that led directly to the death of his family.As investigations have continued, it now appears that a software system called MCASs, which is designed to automatically prevent stalling, was central to both crashes.Njoroge said: “I speak for all of the families who lost loved ones whom they will never see again and who were tragically torn from their lives because of reckless conduct on the part of so many. Particularly Boeing, a company who became steadfast in its single-minded quest to place blame on so-called ‘foreign pilots’.”He went on: “In Canada, Independence Day was celebrated on 1 July. I stayed buried in my little house, in my grief, hearing the sounds of celebration and fireworks in the sky. But all I could think about was the 737 Max struggling to gain height and eventually diving to the ground, killing my whole family and 152 others.”Boeing’s fleet of 737 Maxes remain grounded. Last month, US regulators said they had found more problems with the airplanes after a simulator test, leading United and Southwest airlines to extend their bans on flying the 737 Max.The company appears to be planning to rebrand the plane before it is given the all-clear.

"A Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair has had the name Max dropped from the livery, further fuelling speculation that the manufacturer and airlines will seek to rebrand the troubled plane once it is given the all clear to fly again.Photos have emerged of a 737 Max in Ryanair colours outside Boeing’s manufacturing hub, with the designation 737-8200 – instead of 737 Max – on the nose. The 737-8200 is a type name for the aircraft that is used by aviation agencies.The Max aircraft remains grounded worldwide after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed a total of 346 people. Boeing has yet to convince regulators that software modifications are sufficient to ensure the plane’s safety.Ryanair has 135 of the 737 Max models on order, the first five of which are due for delivery in the autumn, once regulators have declared the plane safe. The airline’s fleet order is comprised entirely of a larger version of the Max 8, with 197 seats, which it has until now referred to in official Ryanair announcements as the 737 Max 200.HI-Res Photos: The MAX name has been dropped from the high capacity version of the #737MAX8 that @Ryanair has on order. pic.twitter.com/3q5QBN0TTgNeither Ryanair nor Boeing has commented on nor confirmed the substitution of the 737-8200 for the better known Max, as seen on the photographs taken at Renton in Washington, US, and posted on social media by Woodys Aeroimages. In previous photos from the same source, new Ryanair 737 Max 200 planes from Boeing are shown with 737 Max on their noses.It is understood that what is painted on the plane is a matter for the airline rather than the manufacturer. According to sources reported in the Wall Street Journal, the Max plane is unlikely to return to the skies before 2020.Ryanair would not be the first airline to use a different formulation in referring to the plane. International Airlines Group, which owns carriers including British Airways and Aer Lingus, was equally coy when purchasing discounted Max planes from Boeing last month. Announcing the letter of intent signed at the Paris airshow, IAG referred to “200 B737 aircraft” that would join its fleet from 2023, which it described as “a mix of 737-8 and 737-10 aircraft”.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp dive into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people onboard are killed. That particular plane had been in use for less than three months.The plane's black box recorder reveals that the Lion Air plane had experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights.Boeing issues revised instructions on how pilots should react to erroneous readings from “angle of attack” sensors, believed to be a key factor in the Lion Air crash.“In our view, the plane was not airworthy,” is the interim finding of the official investigation into the crash. The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard.

"The parent company of British Airways has announced plans to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, the first new sales deal for the passenger jet since it was grounded because of safety fears after two crashes.The short-haul planes would be delivered between 2023 and 2027 and shared among International Airlines Group’s carriers, including Vueling, the low-cost venture Level, and BA, for its flights out of London Gatwick airport.IAG and Boeing revealed a “letter of intent” for the huge order at the Paris airshow, in a significant boost to the US manufacturer after its rival Airbus appeared to be stealing a march on it with big orders and the launch of a  competing model.The fleet of planes, a mixture of 737 Max 8 and Max 10 variants, would be valued at about $25bn (£20bn) at list prices but IAG said it had secured a substantial discount, likely to be more than usual considering Boeing’s difficult circumstances.The deal will be seen as a crucial vote of confidence in the troubled airplane. Although more than 5,000 have been ordered, the IAG deal is the first sale of any kind for the 737 Max since it was grounded worldwide in March.Investigators suspected faulty Boeing software was behind the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters that killed 346 people.Willie Walsh, the IAG chief executive, said: “We have every confidence in Boeing and expect that the aircraft will make a successful return to service in the coming months having received approval from the regulators.”Walsh, a former 737 pilot himself, told reporters in Paris that he would have “no hesitation” in flying on the plane, and voiced confidence in its safety.The manufacturer is still in negotiations with regulators to get a modified version of the plane flying again.Although investigations into the two 737 Max disasters are continuing, problems with sensors and the anti-stall software known as MCAS are believed to have caused both the Ethiopian and Indonesian planes to crash. Pilots in the US have accused Boeing of failing to adequately notify them of changes in the way the aircraft automatically adjusted its angle.No timeline for its return to service has been confirmed but it is expected to be at least August before regulators worldwide agree to lift the ban, should Boeing’s proposed fixes be approved.As well as affirming faith in the 737 Max, the IAG order will have given a boost to Boeing as rival Airbus led the way at the Paris airshow, having unveiled the A321XLR aircraft on Monday.Airbus followed up with a string of announcements of orders for the new plane, a long-range version of its top-selling single-aisle jet.IAG was also among the customers for the A321XLR, placing a firm order for eight planes for Iberia and six for Aer Lingus, plus an option for 14 more.The deal, potentially worth almost $4bn, will see first deliveries in 2023. IAG said each plane will have fully flat seats in a small business cabin and have much the same inflight amenities as traditional, wide-body transatlantic jets.Walsh said the smaller plane would have the same costs per passenger as a bigger long haul aircraft, allowing the airlines to expand their networks profitably. “This will strengthen both Dublin and Madrid hubs providing new transatlantic routes and additional flexibility for connecting passengers,” he said.",BA parent company reveals plans to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max jets,2019-06-18/16:10:12,the parent company of british airways has announced plans to buy  boeing  max aircraft the first new sales deal for the passenger jet since it was grounded because of safety fears after two crashes the short haul planes would be delivered between  and  and shared among international airlines group s carriers including vueling the low cost venture level and ba for its flights out of london gatwick airport iag and boeing revealed a letter of intent for the huge order at the paris airshow in a significant boost to the us manufacturer after its rival airbus appeared to be stealing a march on it with big orders and the launch of a competing model the fleet of planes a mixture of  max  and max  variants would be valued at about bn bn at list prices but iag said it had secured a substantial discount likely to be more than usual considering boeing s difficult circumstances the deal will be seen as a crucial vote of confidence in the troubled airplane although more than   have been ordered the iag deal is the first sale of any kind for the  max since it was grounded worldwide in march investigators suspected faulty boeing software was behind the ethiopian airlines and lion air disasters that killed  people willie walsh the iag chief executive said we have every confidence in boeing and expect that the aircraft will make a successful return to service in the coming months having received approval from the regulators walsh a former  pilot himself told reporters in paris that he would have no hesitation in flying on the plane and voiced confidence in its safety the manufacturer is still in negotiations with regulators to get a modified version of the plane flying again although investigations into the two  max disasters are continuing problems with sensors and the anti stall software known as mcas are believed to have caused both the ethiopian and indonesian planes to crash pilots in the us have accused boeing of failing to adequately notify them of changes in the way the aircraft automatically adjusted its angle no timeline for its return to service has been confirmed but it is expected to be at least august before regulators worldwide agree to lift the ban should boeing s proposed fixes be approved as well as affirming faith in the  max the iag order will have given a boost to boeing as rival airbus led the way at the paris airshow having unveiled the axlr aircraft on monday airbus followed up with a string of announcements of orders for the new plane a long range version of its top selling single aisle jet iag was also among the customers for the axlr placing a firm order for eight planes for iberia and six for aer lingus plus an option for  more the deal potentially worth almost bn will see first deliveries in  iag said each plane will have fully flat seats in a small business cabin and have much the same inflight amenities as traditional wide body transatlantic jets walsh said the smaller plane would have the same costs per passenger as a bigger long haul aircraft allowing the airlines to expand their networks profitably this will strengthen both dublin and madrid hubs providing new transatlantic routes and additional flexibility for connecting passengers he said ,Boeing Crisis,0.523520887
"Airbus has stepped up the pressure on arch-rival Boeing on the opening day of the Paris airshow by launching a new long-range small passenger jet and announcing $15bn (£12bn) worth of orders.The European manufacturer unveiled the A321XLR, a long-haul version of the A321neo that competes with Boeing’s grounded 737 Max.Airbus said on Monday that the plane’s additional range, which opens up routes such as India to Europe or China to Australia, would allow airlines to operate a single-aisle aircraft on intercontinental journeys that are currently possible only on larger, less fuel-efficient wide-body planes.It is expected to confirm up to 200 orders for the new model, the A321XLR, at the show this week, according to Reuters. Middle East Airlines, the Lebanese flag carrier, was announced as launch customer, with an order for four A321XLRs, which are expected to be operational from 2023. The California-based Air Lease Corporation also signed a letter of intent to purchase 27 of the new planes – as well as 50 A220-300s and 23 additional A321neos, worth a total of $11bn at list prices. Boeing, meanwhile, expressed further contrition over the 737 Max, which remains grounded in the wake of the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters. The two crashes, suspected to be caused by faulty software and sensors, killed a total of 346 passengers and crew.Kevin McAllister, the chief executive of Boeing’s commercial aircraft, said: “We are very sorry for the loss of lives.” He also apologised for the disruption to airlines from the subsequent removal of service of the 737 Max. He did not predict when the model would fly again, but said it was “a pivotal moment” for Boeing: “It’s a time to be introspective. And it’s a time for us to make sure accidents like this never happen again.”The firm suffered a fresh setback as its engine supplier, GE Aviation, announced a delay because of problems with a part in the GE9X engine that it is developing for a new Boeing plane. The 777X will be the world’s largest twin-engined passenger jet when it takes to the skies later this year.Expectations for the Paris show, which usually features a plethora of new products and big-money orders, had been dampened by economic headwinds, including the US-China trading salvoes and concerns over sluggish growth.However, Airbus followed up the Air Lease deal with news that Virgin Atlantic would buy 14 of its A330neo widebody planes in an order valued at $4.1bn (£3.3bn). Virgin said the planes, with Rolls-Royce engines, would be 13% more fuel-efficient than the aircraft they replaced and also significantly quieter on take-off and landing.The airline’s chief executive, Shai Weiss, said the deal would “play a pivotal role in our fleet transformation”, adding: “Twenty-nineteen marks a return to growth for Virgin Atlantic as we strive to become the most loved travel company and the nation’s second flag carrier at an expanded Heathrow.”Optimism over airlines’ prospects was in shorter supply elsewhere after another overnight profit warning from German giant Lufthansa.

"On 10 March, 24-year-old Samya Stumo was on her way to start a healthcare job in Kenya when, along with 156 other passengers on an Ethiopian Airlines-operated Boeing 737 Max 8, she died as the plane took a high-speed dive into countryside outside Addis Ababa.Now her parents, Michael Stumo and Nadia Milleron, together with her great-uncle Ralph Nader, have become the most vocal relatives to demand a say on when or if the fastest-selling plane in Boeing’s history should fly again.For four months since the tragedy, Stumo and Milleron say they have been thwarted in their quest for clarity from Boeing, the company’s political representatives in Washington and regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration.The couple recently filed a 50-page negligence lawsuit against Boeing, Ethiopian Airlines and Rosemount Aerospace, the makers of the sensor that informed the Max’s controversial MCAS anti-stall system at the center of investigations into the Ethiopian tragedy and the Lion Air Max crash last October.“We just don’t want there to be a third crash,” Michael Stumo told the Guardian. “Nothing was done after the first Lion Air crash. Something has to be done now after the second.”The drip of information about the rush development of the Max 8, the shortcomings and ferocity of its anti-stall technology, and the degree to which regulators permitted Boeing to certify the plane and its systems, have left Samya Stumo’s parents with little reason for confidence.“We have a fear that the un-grounding process is being rushed and improperly influenced by a concern for Boeing’s profits more than for safety,” Stumo said.In previous air crashes, families have had months to grieve before engaging in the process of investigation and public hearings. In this case, there was no time wasted. FAA officials have indicated the Max 8 could be back in service by the end of the year, though officially airlines have been told to keep the plane off their schedules only until 3 September.“We felt only economic interests were being represented. So we felt an obligation to get involved quicker than we might want to,” Stumo said.While the family is leaving the technical negligence arguments about the plane and its software systems to their lawyers, their narrative is straightforward. “The MCAS software grabbed control of the plane, overpowered the pilots and ran this plane into the ground at 500 or 600mph,” Stumo said.In the days and months after the crash, the victims’ families communicated through WhatsApp groups. The single largest nationality of passengers lost in the Ethiopian crash was Kenyan, accounting for 47 passengers. There are currently 43 cases from the crash filed in Illinois district court, including on behalf of 10 Canadian victims, three generations of the Manant Vaidya family and the wife and three children of Kenyan Paul Njoroge.Nadia Milleron said the couple are trying to help families from abroad through the US legal system. “After the Indonesian crash, there was no opportunity for victims’ families to stand up and say anything, so there was a second crash. We feel we have to do this.”As other air crashes have shown, the greater the ability of victims’ families to work together the better the outcome. But Stumo said reliving the experience in the media or in testimony is distressing. “It takes something out of us each time we do it, but we want a return to a safety-first culture in American aviation.”The couple recalled their hurried trip to Ethiopia in the hope Samya might have survived or that she or her effects might be recoverable. But the plane and its passengers were obliterated on impact.As lawsuits begin to wind their way through the court system, a key question for the families – and future passengers – is when and if the 737 should be recertified by US regulators. Boeing faces an estimated $1.4bn bill for canceled flights and airlines’ lost profits if the Max is still grounded by the end of September. It has cut its production rate for the model by 10 planes a month to 42.Earlier this week, Ali Bahrami, the FAA administrator for aviation safety, said the agency was “under a lot of pressure” and that the plane should be back in the air by December, echoing comments by Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg.But the FAA is not the only regulator involved. The European Aviation Safety Agency is examining Boeing’s changes to the plane’s flight-control system – a process that will not conclude until the end of July at the earliest.“We don’t have confidence the FAA has not been captured by Boeing,” said Stumo. He believes the agency was unduly lax in allowing Boeing to include the MCAS system in the first place.If or when the 737 Max is approved for service, airlines may face difficulties convincing passengers of its safety.A study by US-based Global Business Travel Association for the Financial Times found more than 80% of business travel managers expressed concern about flying on the jet and two-thirds thought their employees might change travel plans to avoid flying on it.American Airlines said last week it would ask airline executives to fly on the plane first to help build public confidence, reported Bloomberg.On the eve of the Paris Air Show on Sunday, Muilenburg said he was “disappointed” that Boeing had not “crisply” relayed information in 2017 about changes in a cockpit alert system designed to warn pilots of a fault in the MCAS system.Muilenburg said that the company “was very confident in the design solution that we have come up with”. Boeing, he added, had work to do “to re-earn the public’s trust”.Victims’ families are also highly attuned to efforts to shift blame to the pilots for the crash. Last month, the Missouri Republican Sam Graves cited pilot error as a factor in the crash – which was rejected by Ethiopian Airlines. Boeing’s Muilenburg also implicated “foreign” pilots in the crashes and denied flaws in the 737 Max.“It doesn’t give us confidence,” said Stumo. “You don’t blame the pilots that the plane overpowered, and you can’t just have the pilots as the last piece of redundancy before a crash.”An Ethiopian Airlines representative said any effort “to divert public attention from the flight control system problem of the airplane is a futile exercise because it is not based on factually correct analysis”.Nader, Milleron’s mother’s brother, has come out against the jet ever returning to service. He says placing larger engines on an airframe designed in the 1960s represents a basic design flaw.The 737 Max “must never fly again”, Nader said at an aviation safety event in Washington earlier this month. “It’s not a matter of software. It’s a matter of structural design defect: the plane’s engines are too much for the traditional fuselage.”But arguing for permanent grounding risks cutting victims’ families out of the safety process, an outcome Stumo and his wife are reluctant to consider because it could exclude them from the deliberative process of reapproval.Instead, they maintain, instead of being guided by financial interests, Boeing needs to go back to being a premier, safety-at-all-costs, manufacturer.If that requires a change of leadership, so be it, said Stumo. “Boeing needs to come clean. It needs to say: something went wrong with this plane. It grabbed control multiple times and tried to run it into the ground. It overpowered the pilots, and we need to figure out how this will not happen again.”",Profit over safety?

"The head of Boeing has admitted the company made communications errors in its dealings with regulators and airlines in the wake of the 737 Max jet crisis that grounded the entire fleet.Speaking on the eve of the Paris air show, the Boeing chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said the company’s communications were “not consistent” and that was “unacceptable”. Muilenburg added that the US aerospace group had failed to communicate “crisply” with regulators and carriers about the plane.The 737 Max was grounded globally in the aftermath of an Ethiopian Airlines crash outside Addis Ababa in March that killed all 157 people on board. It was the 737 Max’s second disaster in five months, after 189 people were killed on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October.Asked how the design and constructions of the 737 Max failed to capture apparent flaws in the software and sensors behind the airplane, Muilenburg said: “Clearly, we can make improvements, and we understand that and we will make those improvements.”Investigations into the Ethiopia and Indonesia accidents have centred on the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which was designed to keep the aircraft stable in flight. An investigation into the Ethiopia crash has reportedly found that the MCAS software – which automatically pushes the aircraft’s nose down to guard against a loss of lift – was activated by erroneous “angle of attack” data from a single sensor, forcing the pilots into a doomed struggle to control the aircraft.Muilenburg added: “When I make comments about the previous design and how we followed those processes, that’s something we put a lot of thought and depth of analysis into. That doesn’t mean that it can’t be improved.”The Boeing boss, who has been under fire over the 737 MAX design and Boeing’s handling of the crisis, said he expected the plane to return to service this year.Muilenburg said he was “disappointed” the company wasn’t more forthcoming with information when engineers in 2017 learned that cockpit alerts intended to warn pilots about certain sensor malfunctions didn’t work or weren’t operating as intended due to a software error. The company previously said senior Boeing leaders didn’t learn about the issue until after the second crash.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air.

The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air had kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.  Flight ET302 crashes about six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard.

Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it w recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down.

American Airlines, a major US customer of the aircraft, has pushed its cancellations of 737 Max services into September.Reuters has reported that the FAA has tentative plans to begin test flights of proposed software fixes, possibly as early as this week.The long-anticipated certification tests, which will take several weeks to complete, have been planned with the support of European and Canadian regulators, its source reported.The 737 Max disasters have ignited tensions between air regulators on either side of the Atlantic, amid concerns over the FAA’s relationship with Boeing, including the degree of self-certification.Ethiopia chose to send the data recorders from the crash to safety investigators in Paris, and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has indicated it would carry out its own assessment of the fix, rather than rely on the FAA in America.On Sunday, the Observer reported that pilots have also voiced fears over the safety of Boeing Dreamliners after a crucial fire-fighting system has been found to have the potential to malfunction.Boeing has issued an alert to airlines using its flagship B787 Dreamliner, warning that the switch used to extinguish an engine fire has failed in a “small number” of instances. The switch also severs the fuel supply and the hydraulic fluid to prevent flames spreading.In its alert to airlines, Boeing warns that long-term heating can cause the fire switch to stick in the locked position so it can’t be used to release the two fire extinguishers in each engine.UK airlines Tui, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic operate more than 60 Dreamliners between them.

"Airline pilots have voiced fears over the safety of a fleet of Boeing aircraft after a crucial fire-fighting system has been found to have the potential to malfunction.Boeing has issued an alert to airlines using its flagship B787 Dreamliner, warning that the switch used to extinguish an engine fire has failed in a “small number” of instances. The switch also severs the fuel supply and the hydraulic fluid to prevent flames spreading.UK airlines Tui, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic operate more than 60 Dreamliners between them. The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has decided not to ground the fleet, despite admitting a “risk to the flying public”.Pilots, however, claim that the safety of passengers and crew is being compromised. “If there was an engine fire on a transatlantic flight and the aircraft had one of the defective fire switches, then we would have to fly with a burning wing for up to three hours before we could safely land,” a pilot with a British airline told the Observer.In its alert to airlines, Boeing warns that long-term heating can cause the fire switch to stick in the locked position so it can’t be used to release the two fire extinguishers in each engine.The FAA has issued an airworthiness directive, mandatory instructions to air operators, announcing that the problem is “likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design” and that “the potential exists for an airline fire to be uncontrollable”. However, it stopped short of grounding the aircraft and instead ordered airlines to check the switch every 30 days.The FAA was criticised for declining to ground Boeing’s fleet of 737 Max aircraft in March after a software malfunction was suspected of causing two fatal crashes. It changed its stance after regulators in other countries banned the aircraft from flying while the accidents were investigated.Launched in 2011, the Dreamliner fleet was designed to revolutionise air travel with fuel-efficient technology and a longer flight range.The $200m (£160m) aircraft were grounded in 2013 following a series of fires caused by leaking batteries. In 2017 the FAA ordered the company to improve its quality control after metal shavings were found among electrical wiring, causing a fire hazard.This year Boeing increased production of the Dreamliner from 12 to 14 a month and announced that it would be replacing up to 900 quality control inspectors with smart technology. Critics claim that the speed of production is compromising safety.“We, as a pilot community, have found it all smacks of taking the cheap route and not the safe route,” says a pilot who spoke anonymously to the Observer.“Boeing insists that the risk of an engine fire is very low, and that’s true, but it’s Boeing’s attitude to the risk that has upset us, especially in light of recent B737 Max issues. If the fire switch malfunctions, there’s no manual override to deploy the engine fire extinguishers and therefore no way of putting out a fire, but Boeing says that it’s fine, and the airlines agree. Such is the fear of Boeing’s power that no one dares speak out.”Tui, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic all told the Observer that they abided by the safety requirements set out by aviation authorities and their aircraft had been checked and would continue to fly as normal.Boeing said that fewer than 1% of fire switches have proved defective, and that it was supporting airlines with inspections and replacement parts. “Boeing works closely with the FAA to monitor the fleet for potential safety issues and take appropriate actions,” said a spokesperson.“Engine fires are a very unlikely event and there have been no observed engine fires in the 787 fleet history.”The FAA declined to comment on pilot concerns, stating that it invited responses in February when the airworthiness directive was proposed.",Pilots reveal safety fears over Boeing’s fleet of Dreamliners,2019-06-15/17:18:40,airline pilots have voiced fears over the safety of a fleet of boeing aircraft after a crucial fire fighting system has been found to have the potential to malfunction boeing has issued an alert to airlines using its flagship b dreamliner warning that the switch used to extinguish an engine fire has failed in a small number of instances the switch also severs the fuel supply and the hydraulic fluid to prevent flames spreading uk airlines tui british airways and virgin atlantic operate more than  dreamliners between them the us regulator the federal aviation administration faa has decided not to ground the fleet despite admitting a risk to the flying public pilots however claim that the safety of passengers and crew is being compromised if there was an engine fire on a transatlantic flight and the aircraft had one of the defective fire switches then we would have to fly with a burning wing for up to three hours before we could safely land a pilot with a british airline told the observer in its alert to airlines boeing warns that long term heating can cause the fire switch to stick in the locked position so it can t be used to release the two fire extinguishers in each engine the faa has issued an airworthiness directive mandatory instructions to air operators announcing that the problem is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design and that the potential exists for an airline fire to be uncontrollable however it stopped short of grounding the aircraft and instead ordered airlines to check the switch every  days the faa was criticised for declining to ground boeing s fleet of  max aircraft in march after a software malfunction was suspected of causing two fatal crashes it changed its stance after regulators in other countries banned the aircraft from flying while the accidents were investigated launched in  the dreamliner fleet was designed to revolutionise air travel with fuel efficient technology and a longer flight range the m m aircraft were grounded in  following a series of fires caused by leaking batteries in  the faa ordered the company to improve its quality control after metal shavings were found among electrical wiring causing a fire hazard this year boeing increased production of the dreamliner from  to  a month and announced that it would be replacing up to  quality control inspectors with smart technology critics claim that the speed of production is compromising safety we as a pilot community have found it all smacks of taking the cheap route and not the safe route says a pilot who spoke anonymously to the observer boeing insists that the risk of an engine fire is very low and that s true but it s boeing s attitude to the risk that has upset us especially in light of recent b max issues if the fire switch malfunctions there s no manual override to deploy the engine fire extinguishers and therefore no way of putting out a fire but boeing says that it s fine and the airlines agree such is the fear of boeing s power that no one dares speak out tui british airways and virgin atlantic all told the observer that they abided by the safety requirements set out by aviation authorities and their aircraft had been checked and would continue to fly as normal boeing said that fewer than  of fire switches have proved defective and that it was supporting airlines with inspections and replacement parts boeing works closely with the faa to monitor the fleet for potential safety issues and take appropriate actions said a spokesperson engine fires are a very unlikely event and there have been no observed engine fires in the  fleet history the faa declined to comment on pilot concerns stating that it invited responses in february when the airworthiness directive was proposed ,Boeing Crisis,0.478446752
"Safety regulators in the US have identified a further problem in Boeing’s grounded 737 Max model and the generation of planes that preceded it.The Federal Aviation Administration has told airlines to check more than 300 737 aircraft, including 179 of the Max model, for improperly manufactured parts.The affected components – part of the wing – help provide lift during takeoff and landing, and “may be susceptible to premature failure or cracks resulting from the improper manufacturing process”, the FAA said on Sunday.The 737 Max, Boeing’s top-selling passenger jet, was taken out of service in March after the second fatal crash in four months. A total of 346 people died in the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters.The manufacturer said it had not been told of any issues during flying regarding the potentially faulty parts. It said there were 20 737 Max airplanes that were likely to have the defective parts, and that airlines would check an additional 159 planes. Another 133 of the 737 NG model, a predecessor to the Max, will also be checked.The FAA said a complete failure of the part, called a leading-edge slat track, would not cause a crash, but could cause aircraft damage in flight. Airlines operating the affected NG planes need to remove faulty parts within 10 days, but can continue to operate them in the meantime.However, the wider worries around the 737 Max led to a $1bn (£790m) order being put on hold on Monday, as the Azerbaijan airline AZAL postponed an order for 10 planes.Boeing has yet to finalise a software upgrade, which it hopes will convince regulators that it is safe for the plane to return to the skies. Although investigations continue, a controversial automated anti-stall system, MCAS, has been implicated in both crashes.Last week, the head of the global airline trade body, IATA, said it would be at least August before the all clear was given, with regulators outside the US having indicated that they will also expect to give separate clearance rather than accept the FAA ruling.However, Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, told reporters at IATA’s AGM in Seoul that it could take six months to restore 737 Max operations, saying: “If it is in the air by Christmas, I’ll be surprised.”",Further safety issue found in grounded Boeing 737 Max planes,2019-06-03/17:01:34,safety regulators in the us have identified a further problem in boeing s grounded  max model and the generation of planes that preceded it the federal aviation administration has told airlines to check more than   aircraft including  of the max model for improperly manufactured parts the affected components part of the wing help provide lift during takeoff and landing and may be susceptible to premature failure or cracks resulting from the improper manufacturing process the faa said on sunday the  max boeing s top selling passenger jet was taken out of service in march after the second fatal crash in four months a total of  people died in the ethiopian airlines and lion air disasters the manufacturer said it had not been told of any issues during flying regarding the potentially faulty parts it said there were   max airplanes that were likely to have the defective parts and that airlines would check an additional  planes another  of the  ng model a predecessor to the max will also be checked the faa said a complete failure of the part called a leading edge slat track would not cause a crash but could cause aircraft damage in flight airlines operating the affected ng planes need to remove faulty parts within  days but can continue to operate them in the meantime however the wider worries around the  max led to a bn m order being put on hold on monday as the azerbaijan airline azal postponed an order for  planes boeing has yet to finalise a software upgrade which it hopes will convince regulators that it is safe for the plane to return to the skies although investigations continue a controversial automated anti stall system mcas has been implicated in both crashes last week the head of the global airline trade body iata said it would be at least august before the all clear was given with regulators outside the us having indicated that they will also expect to give separate clearance rather than accept the faa ruling however tim clark the president of emirates told reporters at iata s agm in seoul that it could take six months to restore  max operations saying if it is in the air by christmas i ll be surprised ,Boeing Crisis,0.533525407
"When Andrés Manuel López Obrador put his presidential Boeing up for sale last year and pledged to travel economy class around Mexico, it was part of a budget-slashing populist push to get closer to the people.On Tuesday at lunchtime, as he flew low-cost to the city of Tepic, Mexico’s leftist president was thanked with an in-flight ode from one starstruck passenger.“Obrador is a great presidente and will always be able to count on our support, sí señor!” the singer warbled as her leader – best known as simply Amlo – looked on from his emergency exit window seat.“The people applaud him, they follow and respect him because we don’t want any more corruption,” the passenger, who was named only as Paloma, continued in reference to López Obrador’s pledge to crack down on thieving politicians.The president’s supporters – or “Amlovers”, as some call them – lapped up the midair homage to a politician who continues to fly high in the polls thanks to his vow to lead a historic “transformation” of their profoundly unequal nation.But critics question whether it is safe or efficient for a head of state to commute on low-cost carriers and López Obrador’s decision to travel economy has also exposed him to the wrath of some hostile Mexican voters.Mexico’s budget airlines have reveled in the free publicity, tweeting photographs of their low-cost leader on board. Tuesday’s journey provided less positive headlines, however, after Amlo’s plane was forced to abort its landing at the last minute because of “unexpected weather conditions” causing a 13-minute delay.“It was nothing serious. It’s normal,” López Obrador, 65, told reporters after safely landing in Tepic, where he was received with a second rendition of his inflight serenade.",‘The people applaud him’: Amlo receives in-flight serenade from passenger,2019-05-29/17:17:35,when andrés manuel lópez obrador put his presidential boeing up for sale last year and pledged to travel economy class around mexico it was part of a budget slashing populist push to get closer to the people on tuesday at lunchtime as he flew low cost to the city of tepic mexico s leftist president was thanked with an in flight ode from one starstruck passenger obrador is a great presidente and will always be able to count on our support sí señor the singer warbled as her leader best known as simply amlo looked on from his emergency exit window seat the people applaud him they follow and respect him because we don t want any more corruption the passenger who was named only as paloma continued in reference to lópez obrador s pledge to crack down on thieving politicians the president s supporters or amlovers as some call them lapped up the midair homage to a politician who continues to fly high in the polls thanks to his vow to lead a historic transformation of their profoundly unequal nation but critics question whether it is safe or efficient for a head of state to commute on low cost carriers and lópez obrador s decision to travel economy has also exposed him to the wrath of some hostile mexican voters mexico s budget airlines have reveled in the free publicity tweeting photographs of their low cost leader on board tuesday s journey provided less positive headlines however after amlo s plane was forced to abort its landing at the last minute because of unexpected weather conditions causing a  minute delay it was nothing serious it s normal lópez obrador  told reporters after safely landing in tepic where he was received with a second rendition of his inflight serenade ,Boeing Crisis,0.188144177
"Even without missiles being test-fired into the sky by a hostile regime 35 miles to the north, airline executives might be a little tense next weekend. More than 1,000 of them will gather in the South Korean capital, Seoul, for the big event in the industry’s calendar, the International Air Transport Association’s general meeting.Many Iata members have a degree of protection from turbulence thanks to deep pockets, airline alliances, sheer size, or national loyalty. But the big issues to be discussed in Seoul may still keep some jet-lagged executives awake at night.Globally, the industry is still turning a profit. It is on course for a 10th straight year of positive returns, after racking up losses in the financial crisis. Jet fuel is still far cheaper than the $120-plus per barrel airlines had to pay until 2013 but, bar a sharp plunge in late 2018, the price is heading upwards. European carriers in particular are looking shaky, with a combined loss in early 2019 ten times worse than last year’s first quarter – although the collapse of smaller airlines may allow survivors to increase fares. Behind the low yield from passengers is another statistic that might spook the industry: a tailing-off in demand for air freight. If the Trump trade war escalates, storm clouds could appear.More than once this decade, Iata has proudly reported the safest year on record for aviation. Drilling down into the statistics to separate out old turboprops from international commercial flights, the organisation has spoken of “zero western-built passenger jet hull losses”. These modern planes, conventional wisdom had it, did not fall out of the skies. Now the two Boeing 737 Max crashes, with 346 fatalities, have shaken that complacency. The repercussions for an industry that has ordered hundreds more 737 Max aircraft, expecting to retire its older planes and fly further and cheaper, are not clear. Some fear passengers will refuse to fly on 737 Max planes if and when regulatory approval is restored, with a breakdown in trust in the whole process of certification.Back in the days when Britain was a key part of Europe, even international airlines were clamouring for access to Heathrow: tearing down the opposition to a third runway became a key objective. With that one in the bag, the discussion has largely moved on from airports – although Mexico’s decision to scrap plans for a new international hub at the capital has provoked some airline consternation. The new “infrastructure” issue is airspace: airlines see the highways in the skies, in Europe in particular, getting clogged, and the traffic lights malfunctioning due to a lack of staff and strike-happy controllers. Plans for an efficient, pan-European traffic control system, which could both straighten flight paths to save fuel and dampen the impact of local industrial action, have stagnated.As growing protests declare a climate emergency, and other sectors clean up their act, transport looks ever more the problem. And within the sector, aviation has yet to identify even the potential solutions that land-based transport can envisage. “Only a highly [greenhouse gas] emitting volatile fuel has the weight-to-power density that allows you to fly,” says aviation consultant Andrew Charlton. Airlines have clung to a “sustainable roadmap” that looks an ever weaker response to the climate emergency, largely reliant on carbon offsetting. The main plank of that, the Corsia scheme agreed in 2018 via the UN, whereby international airlines will voluntarily report and offset emissions above current levels, has started but not been secured. And, says Charlton, “what seemed like a clever idea is now … looking a pretty relaxed timetable. The airlines think it’s a fantastic win, so you can guess from that it’s not very demanding.” A technological breakthrough will be sorely needed for aviation to continue as is. But schemes to produce clean fuels or electric planes for the mass market are, at best, in their infancy.An eyecatching conference highlight is the presentation of Iata’s diversity and inclusion awards – sponsored by Qatar Airways. Rather than a satirical attempt to rival Henry Kissinger’s Nobel peace prize, insiders stress that this is a serious attempt at redemption after Qatar’s colourful chief executive, Akbar al-Baker, last year stole conference headlines by insisting that only a man could do his job.

"American Airlines’ pilots’ union has hit back at Boeing for insinuating that some responsibility for the two crashes of its 737 Max jets lies with the pilots, and claimed AA pilots made several suggestions to Boeing to fix the plane’s anti-stall systems before the second crash.Describing Boeing’s position as “inexcusable”, Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, accused Boeing of unfairly blaming foreign pilots involved in the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes.Tajer told CNN: “Shame on you. We’re going to call you out on it. That’s a poisoned, diseased philosophy.” Asked if the Ethiopian crash might have been prevented if Boeing had acted on the US pilots’ concerns, Tajer said: “I think that’s a fair conclusion.”Tajer said the Ethiopian Airlines pilots did what they were instructed to do, but that Boeing’s controversial anti-stall software (MCAS) forced the plane into such an aggressive nosedive that the pilots could not recover. “They had wired that thing so that it was irrecoverable. It just blew us away,” Tajer said.In the original exchange with Boeing, the audio of which was released earlier this month, pilots angrily confronted a Boeing official about the MCAS system implicated in both crashes.“These guys didn’t even know the damn system was on the airplane,” a pilot said.In recent weeks, Boeing has tried to shift blame for both crashes from its software systems. In April, Dennis Muilenburg, the company’s chief executive, claimed the 737 Max was correctly designed and suggested the pilots did not “completely” follow the procedures that Boeing had outlined.Ethiopian officials have insisted the Ethiopian Airlines pilots repeatedly performed all of Boeing’s procedures, but were unable to recover the plane. Ethiopian Airlines also complained that Boeing did not do enough to warn them about the system or provide functioning cockpit alerts about problems with sensors.Earlier this week, US aviation officials said a bird strike may have triggered the faulty data that led to the MCAS system engaging. However, an Ethiopian Airlines spokesman said that the preliminary crash investigation report showed “no evidence of any foreign object damage”.At a meeting on Thursday, 33 international aviation authorities will meet the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to discuss the process of review for the software fixes Boeing is to make to fix the MCAS system and give pilots greater control.FAA’s acting administrator, Dan Elwell, rejected the idea that the twin crashes involving the aircraft have shaken trust between foreign regulators and the FAA. He said the FAA and the other regulators remain in “constant, close communication”.But he would not predict a timeline for certifying Boeing’s software fix. When asked whether plans to return the 737 Max to service in August were realistic, Elwell admitted recertification could be pushed to October or beyond.",American Airlines union: blaming pilots for Boeing 737 Max crashes 'inexcusable',2019-05-23/16:40:51,american airlines pilots union has hit back at boeing for insinuating that some responsibility for the two crashes of its  max jets lies with the pilots and claimed aa pilots made several suggestions to boeing to fix the plane s anti stall systems before the second crash describing boeing s position as inexcusable dennis tajer a spokesman for the allied pilots association accused boeing of unfairly blaming foreign pilots involved in the lion air and ethiopian airlines crashes tajer told cnn shame on you we re going to call you out on it that s a poisoned diseased philosophy asked if the ethiopian crash might have been prevented if boeing had acted on the us pilots concerns tajer said i think that s a fair conclusion tajer said the ethiopian airlines pilots did what they were instructed to do but that boeing s controversial anti stall software mcas forced the plane into such an aggressive nosedive that the pilots could not recover they had wired that thing so that it was irrecoverable it just blew us away tajer said in the original exchange with boeing the audio of which was released earlier this month pilots angrily confronted a boeing official about the mcas system implicated in both crashes these guys didn t even know the damn system was on the airplane a pilot said in recent weeks boeing has tried to shift blame for both crashes from its software systems in april dennis muilenburg the company s chief executive claimed the  max was correctly designed and suggested the pilots did not completely follow the procedures that boeing had outlined ethiopian officials have insisted the ethiopian airlines pilots repeatedly performed all of boeing s procedures but were unable to recover the plane ethiopian airlines also complained that boeing did not do enough to warn them about the system or provide functioning cockpit alerts about problems with sensors earlier this week us aviation officials said a bird strike may have triggered the faulty data that led to the mcas system engaging however an ethiopian airlines spokesman said that the preliminary crash investigation report showed no evidence of any foreign object damage at a meeting on thursday  international aviation authorities will meet the federal aviation administration faa to discuss the process of review for the software fixes boeing is to make to fix the mcas system and give pilots greater control faa s acting administrator dan elwell rejected the idea that the twin crashes involving the aircraft have shaken trust between foreign regulators and the faa he said the faa and the other regulators remain in constant close communication but he would not predict a timeline for certifying boeing s software fix when asked whether plans to return the  max to service in august were realistic elwell admitted recertification could be pushed to october or beyond ,Boeing Crisis,0.448349267
"Boeing officials, shortly after the first fatal crash of its 737 Max jet, played down the likelihood that a bird strike could impair the plane’s sensor equipment. Now investigators are exploring whether such a situation led to a second deadly accident just five months later.According to the Wall Street Journal, US aviation authorities believe a bird collision may have set off the sequence of events that led to the downing of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max in March, in which 157 people died.American Airlines pilots called a meeting with Boeing last November after a Lion Air Max crashed in Indonesia, killing all 189 passengers and crew.The Journal reviewed a recording of the meeting in which Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice-president of product strategy, raised and dismissed the possibility that a bird strike could trigger a second crash by affecting the Max’s controversial sensor system.Sinnett told the pilots he was “absolutely” confident that heightened pilot awareness following the Lion Air disaster had further reduced the chances of another accident.Ethiopian Airlines has been facing criticism of its pilots’ conduct in the wake of the crash. At a House hearing into the accidents last week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) administrator, Daniel Elwell, said pilot error contributed to the crash.In both crashes, the Max’s anti-stall system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (Mcas), appears to have forced the planes’ noses down shortly after takeoff, leaving the pilots struggling unsuccessfully to right the jets before they crashed.The Mcas system may have been reacting to faulty information from sensors that could have been damaged by a bird strike.Ethiopian Airlines has rejected accusations that its pilots contributed to the crash. Officials have said Boeing failed to provide cockpit alerts that would have warned the pilots about sensor errors.Last week, the airline said its pilots followed procedures set out by the FAA and Boeing but “none of the expected warnings appeared in the cockpit, which deprived the pilots of necessary and timely information”.Nine countries and the US justice department are currently investigating the crashes.",Boeing dismissed chance of 'bird strike' that may have caused second 737 Max crash,2019-05-21/16:25:07,boeing officials shortly after the first fatal crash of its  max jet played down the likelihood that a bird strike could impair the plane s sensor equipment now investigators are exploring whether such a situation led to a second deadly accident just five months later according to the wall street journal us aviation authorities believe a bird collision may have set off the sequence of events that led to the downing of an ethiopian airlines  max in march in which  people died american airlines pilots called a meeting with boeing last november after a lion air max crashed in indonesia killing all  passengers and crew the journal reviewed a recording of the meeting in which mike sinnett boeing s vice president of product strategy raised and dismissed the possibility that a bird strike could trigger a second crash by affecting the max s controversial sensor system sinnett told the pilots he was absolutely confident that heightened pilot awareness following the lion air disaster had further reduced the chances of another accident ethiopian airlines has been facing criticism of its pilots conduct in the wake of the crash at a house hearing into the accidents last week the federal aviation administration faa administrator daniel elwell said pilot error contributed to the crash in both crashes the max s anti stall system called the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system mcas appears to have forced the planes noses down shortly after takeoff leaving the pilots struggling unsuccessfully to right the jets before they crashed the mcas system may have been reacting to faulty information from sensors that could have been damaged by a bird strike ethiopian airlines has rejected accusations that its pilots contributed to the crash officials have said boeing failed to provide cockpit alerts that would have warned the pilots about sensor errors last week the airline said its pilots followed procedures set out by the faa and boeing but none of the expected warnings appeared in the cockpit which deprived the pilots of necessary and timely information nine countries and the us justice department are currently investigating the crashes ,Boeing Crisis,0.441869199
"WASHINGTON/SAO PAULO   - Southwest Airlines Co and Brazil’s Gol Linhas Aereas have grounded a total of 13 Boeing Co 737 NG airplanes, the companies said, after U.S. regulators ordered urgent inspections. Southwest said it had taken two planes out of service, while Gol had grounded 11. Both airlines are major operators of the 737, including the NG variant and the more recent MAX, which has been grounded for months after two deadly crashes.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last week told aircraft operators to inspect 165 older 737 NG planes for structural cracks within seven days, after cracking was found on a small number of planes. Nearly all the 165 jets were Southwest aircraft, officials said.  First delivered in 1997, the NG is the third generation of the 737, preceding the grounded MAX, which is unaffected by the cracking issues. Southwest, which did not find any issues in the “vast majority” of planes, said it “removed the two aircraft from our operation and reported the findings to Boeing and the FAA.”  Gol, which runs a fleet of 115 737s excluding its grounded MAX jets, said it took 11 out of service after finding “evidence of the need to replace a specific component.” The fleet change will affect 3% of passengers until Dec. 15, it said. The inspections were ordered following the discovery of cracks on a part known as the “pickle fork,” which attaches the fuselage to the wing structure and manages forces. Minor aircraft cracks are not unusual, an industry source said, but are not normally expected to occur on the pickle fork until near the end of the plane’s lifespan, typically considered to be more than 90,000 takeoff and landing cycles. The FAA mandated checks for “cracking of the left and right hand side outboard chords of frame fittings and failsafe straps,” warning the issue “could adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane” and result in loss of control. More planes will eventually be inspected, it said. The initial inspection order covered a total of 1,911 U.S.-registered planes. The checks can be done visually and take about an hour per airplane. Aircraft that have carried out more than 30,000 flight legs, or cycles, must be checked within seven days, the safety regulator said, while those with 22,600-29,999 cycles must be checked before completing a further 1,000. Boeing has been in touch with 737 NG operators about the inspections, the manufacturer said earlier, emphasizing that “no in-service issues have been reported.” United Airlines and American Airlines Inc are among other U.S. carriers flying the 737 NG, which includes the 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER variants. Each airline has about 80 planes that will need inspection in coming months, United and American said, but none that fall into the seven-day requirement for more urgent checks. European budget carrier Ryanair, which has a fleet of more than 450 737-800s, confirmed it was in the process of carrying out the inspections, without saying how many planes required them. “We are midway through the first part of this mandatory check program and don’t expect it will have any impact upon our fleet or operations,” a Ryanair spokeswoman said. Transavia Airlines, a low-cost carrier owned by Air France-KLM, said it would examine all 42 of its 737s even though only 16 need checks under the FAA mandate - of which one was inspected under the seven-day requirement. KLM, which also operates 737 NGs, has inspected all but one of 13 aircraft covered by the order and found no anomalies, a spokesman said. Jeju Air, a South Korean low-cost operator, had also completed the majority of required checks, while inspections were ongoing at domestic rival Jin Air and had been completed at Eastar Jet. None of the three airlines had found any issues, they said.

"BRUSSELS   - EU antitrust regulators opened on Friday a full-scale investigation into Boeing’s (BA.N) bid for a controlling stake in Embraer’s (EMBR3.SA) commercial aircraft arm, saying the deal may reduce competition and push up prices. The European Commission said the deal would remove world No. 3 player Embraer from the commercial aircraft industry while potential rivals from China, Japan and Russia would be unable to fill the gap in the next decade because of the high barriers to entry. The EU competition enforcer said both companies engage in head-to-head competition in terms of price and other parameters worldwide and in Europe. The deal would also remove Embraer from the overall single aisle plane market. The Commission set a Feb. 20 deadline for its decision. Reuters was the first to report on an imminent EU investigation, which was subsequently confirmed by Embraer.

"DUBLIN   - All Ryanair (RYA.I) flights to and from British and Irish airports have departed without disruption so far on Thursday, the airline said, adding it also expected no impact for the rest of the day from a strike by some of its pilots based in Britain. Ryanair unions in Ireland, Britain, Spain and Portugal have been planning strikes over various grievances that began with a five-day cabin crew walkout in Portugal on Wednesday and continued with a 48-hour strike by some UK pilots on Thursday. Europe’s biggest low cost airlines said its first flights to and from UK airports on Thursday operated with 97% punctuality, with the slight slip due to air traffic control delays.   While more widespread strikes over pay and conditions a year ago forced Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights, the airline has forecast minimal disruption this time and ran a full schedule without major delays in the first day of action in Portugal. With the exception of two delayed flights, all departures from Portugal appeared to be operating as normal on Thursday. Fernando Gandra, head of the SNPVAC trade union representing striking Portuguese cabin crew, told Reuters the airline had managed the fallout by making major changes to departure times in advance and notifying passengers ahead of time. Ryanair also limited the potential disruption by taking its fight to the courts on Wednesday and winning an Irish High Court injunction to prevent Dublin-based pilots striking. A London court rejected a similar application against its British pilots, who plan a second strike from the early hours of Sept. 2 until just before midnight on Sept. 4. Ryanair has said the striking pilots, members of the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), represent less than 30% of those operating its aircraft there. Unions representing cabin crew in Spain said this week their plans for 10 days of strikes next month still stood after a round of mediated talks with the airline ended without agreement. The strikes are the first since Ryanair managed to quell last year’s disputes by reaching pay deals with many staff in Europe following its dramatic U-turn in late 2017 to recognize trade unions for the first time. However, it has failed to move beyond recognition deals with others and further angered unions by telling staff last month that it had 900 more pilots and crew than it needed due to delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX, and would have to close some bases.

"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. trade deficit jumped in May and trade tensions between the United States and China helped drive activity in the services sector to a two-year low in June, further signs that economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter. The economy’s dimming outlook was also underscored by other data on Wednesday showing private employers adding far fewer-than-expected jobs to their payrolls last month.  New orders for manufactured goods dropped in May for a second straight month. The reports followed recent weak housing and business investment data, as well as moderate consumer spending. Business and consumer confidence have dipped. The slowdown in activity as last year’s massive stimulus from tax cuts and more government spending fades could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this month.  The U.S. central bank last month signaled it could ease monetary policy as early as its July 30-31 meeting, citing rising risks to the economy from the trade war between Washington and Beijing, and low inflation. The International Monetary Fund has lowered global growth estimates because of reduced trade flows as a result of the trade fights. “One wonders how long Washington will continue to claim they are helping the U.S. economy,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “One of the factors behind the economy’s fall in the Great Depression was protectionism and trade wars, and it will be a miracle if the world economy can avoid another downturn this time.” The trade deficit rose 8.4% to $55.5 billion as a surge in imports overshadowed a broad increase in exports, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap widening to $54.0 billion in May. The goods trade deficit with China, a focus of President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda, increased 12.2% to $30.2 billion. Trump imposed additional import tariffs on Chinese goods, after a breakdown in negotiations, prompting Beijing to retaliate. Economists say the expectation of additional duties likely boosted imports from China, which jumped 12.8% in May.  Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week agreed to a trade truce and a return to talks. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Tuesday talks were heading in the right direction, but it would take time to get the right deal made. The U.S.-China trade tensions have caused wild swings in the trade deficit, with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants. Trump on Wednesday accused China and Europe of “playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA.”  “We still think it is slightly more likely than not that the trade dispute with China will ultimately escalate further,” said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London. “Trade is likely to remain a modest drag on growth over the second half of this year, which we expect to compound a sharp slowdown in domestic demand growth.” The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies in thin U.S. trade ahead of Thursday's Independence Day holiday. Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 .SPX index hitting a record high on expectations of a rate cut. U.S. Treasury prices also were higher. In May, goods imports increased 4.0% to $217.0 billion. Apart from drawing more imports from China, the United States imported record amounts from the European Union, Mexico and Canada in May. The increase in imports was broad-based, with those of motor vehicle and parts soaring to an all-time high.  Petroleum imports rose and crude oil was more expensive, helping to inflate the import bill in May.  Goods exports increased 2.8% to $140.8 billion. Exports advanced across all sectors, including passenger aircraft despite Boeing (BA.N) in March suspending deliveries of its fastest-selling MAX 737 jetliner. The aircraft was grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes in five months.  When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit increased $4.8 billion to $87.0 billion in May, suggesting trade could be a drag on second-quarter gross domestic product.  Trade contributed 0.94 percentage point to the economy’s 3.1% annualized growth pace in the first quarter. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.3% rate in the April-June quarter. Anxiety over trade is spilling over from manufacturing to the services industries. In a third report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 55.1 in June, the lowest reading since July 2017, from 56.9 in May.  A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. The ISM said “a degree of uncertainty exists due to trade and tariffs.”  The decrease in services industry activity reflected a decline in the new orders measure, which dropped to the lowest level since December 2017. A gauge of services employment also fell. “The slowing trend evident across categories raises concern that a slowing trend most evident in manufacturing is also becoming more apparent in the broader economy,” said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York. “This should leave the Fed right on the precipice of providing some ‘insurance’ by cutting rates at the July meeting.” The slowdown in employment was mirrored by the ADP National Employment Report showing private payrolls increased by 102,000 jobs in June from 41,000 in May, but below market expectations for a gain of 140,000. That suggests a moderate rebound in the private payrolls component of the government’s closely followed employment report.  The June employment report will be released on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters are looking for nonfarm employment to have increased by 160,000 jobs after rising by only 75,000 in May. The unemployment rate is expected to have held near a 50-year low of 3.6% in June.  Still, layoffs remain low.

"CHICAGO   - Southwest Airlines Co’s mechanics union said on Tuesday its members had overwhelmingly voted to ratify a tentative contract agreement with the airline, ending seven years of labor negotiations fraught with legal disputes and flight disruptions. The agreement, which brought to a close one of the most disruptive labor disputes to hit a top-four U.S. airline in more than a decade, came a day after rival U.S. carrier American Airlines Group Inc said it was filing a labor-related lawsuit against its mechanics. Analysts have highlighted labor issues as a main concern for airlines this year, in addition to rising fuel costs and the grounding of Boeing MAX jets after two fatal crashes.  Mechanics at both American and Southwest have complained that the airlines are moving to outsource maintenance work that has traditionally been done in-house.  In a statement on its website, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, which represents around 2,500 Southwest mechanics, said about 95 percent of its members had voted to accept a labor agreement that includes significant pay increases and headcount protections. Southwest, which had been forced to cancel hundreds of flights earlier this year stemming from the mechanics dispute, welcomed the agreement. “Our mechanics will receive well-deserved pay increases, and the company will realize additional flexibilities necessary to compete in today’s airline industry,” Russell McCrady, vice president of labor relations, said in a statement. Separately on Tuesday, American Airlines’ mechanics union, the TWU-IAM Association, said it was “ready and willing” to return to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair contract, as long as it had a willing partner. The comment followed a federal lawsuit filed by American alleging an illegal slowdown by its mechanics aimed at disrupting operations to improve their position in labor talks, which began in 2015. “We would much prefer to be at the negotiating table than in a legal battle brought on by American,” the TWU-IAM Association said in a statement. American said the slowdowns had escalated following the last joint bargaining session on April 25, which was overseen by the National Mediation Board. The action has caused hundreds of flight cancellations and more than 1,000 maintenance delays, threatening further disruption during the busy U.S. summer, it said. TWU-IAM, formed in 2015 after the merger of US Airways and American Airlines, said it wants to keep the company from outsourcing more maintenance and repair work to South America, China and Europe, and is “standing strong” against cuts to medical benefits and retirement security.

"NEW YORK   - Wall Street lost ground on Monday, dragged down by financials as underwhelming bank earnings curbed investor enthusiasm. But while all three major U.S. stock indexes edged lower, the S&P 500 remained within a percent of its record high. Following a January-March rally that marked the U.S. stock market’s best quarterly performance in nearly a decade, stocks had been in a holding pattern in April ahead of first quarter reporting season.  Goldman Sachs dipped 3.8% after the investment bank’s first quarter revenue came in below analyst expectations. Citigroup Inc posted higher-than-expected earnings as cost-cutting offset falling revenues. Its shares ended the session nominally lower, dropping 0.1%. “We’re coming off of a strong week last week,” said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. “So any bad news or earnings reports this week, such as we saw with Goldman and Citigroup, is going to take away some of that momentum.”  With first quarter reporting season shifting into high gear, analysts now see S&P 500 companies posting a 2.1% year-on-year decline in profits. While an improvement over recent estimates, it would still mark the first annual decline in earnings since 2016. “We’ll get a clearer sense as we move through the week,” Sroka added. “As we move into other sectors we’ll get a clearer picture of corporate earnings and the economy.”  Bank of America Co, Morgan Stanley, Netflix Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Textron Inc, Honeywell International Inc, Schlumberger NV and  American Express Co are among the closely-watched earnings expected this holiday-shortened week. Aside from earnings, “we still have to be watchful for global geopolitical events such as the U.S.-China trade discussion,” warned Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. Sources said U.S. negotiators have softened their demands that China curb industrial subsidies as a condition for a trade deal, marking a retreat from a core U.S. objective. “It’s a net positive,” Stovall said. “The president wants to get some sort of deal signed so he can move on.”   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.53 points, or 0.1%, to 26,384.77, the S&P 500 lost 1.83 points, or 0.06%, to 2,905.58 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 8.15 points, or 0.1%, to 7,976.01. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, six ended the session in the red. Financials were the biggest percentage losers, closing down 0.6% and snapping their three-day winning streak.  Waste Management Inc rose 2.4% following its announcement that it would buy smaller rival Advanced Disposal Services Inc for about $3 billion. Boeing Co slid 1.1% after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that the planemaker should fix and “rebrand” its 737 MAX jet. Lyft Inc extended its slide, falling 6.3%. The ride-hailing platform, which had its market debut in March, is now trading about 22% below its $72 offer price. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.57-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

"SEATTLE/LONDON   - A Boeing Co software fix for the grounded 737 MAX will prevent repeated operation of an anti-stall system at the center of safety concerns and deactivate it altogether if two sensors disagree widely, two people familiar with pilot briefings said. The anti-stall system - known as MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System - has been pinpointed by investigators probing October’s fatal Lion Air crash and faces new scrutiny in the wake of another fatal accident in Ethiopia. Those accidents, which killed nearly 350 people, triggered the worldwide grounding of Boeing’s flagship 737 MAX aircraft     and ignited a debate over the proper balance between man and machine in piloting the latest version of the 50-year-old 737. The MAX has bigger engines, mounted further forward, which can force the plane’s nose higher, threatening a stall. MCAS was designed to counter this but some experts say it overcompensated and the latest changes give some authority back to the pilot. Airline briefings on the software upgrade, which is designed to address the situation faced by pilots of the doomed Lion Air jet last October, started on Saturday. Pilots have been told that the MCAS system - which forces the nose downwards to avoid a stall, or loss of lift - will only operate one time for each event rather than impose repeated corrections like those believed to have pushed the Lion Air jet into a dive, the two people familiar with the briefings said. Additionally, MCAS will be disabled whenever two sensors that measure the ‘angle of attack’ - a parameter that determines how close a plane is to an aerodynamic stall - differ too much. “Otherwise it would be garbage in, garbage out,” a third person familiar with the briefings said.  This is a change from the previous set-up which only linked MCAS to one sensor at a time, ignoring the other, and which may have resulted in a single point of failure on Lion Air 610. The pilot will be able to deduce that MCAS is no longer working in the background because the system will show a warning message labeled “AOA disagree”, indicating the two sensors are producing values that differ by an excessive margin. Previously the “AOA disagree” warning would not have halted the MCAS software because the system was designed to focus on either the left or right sensor, alternating between flights. It was oblivious to whether readings from the sensors were aligned. Boeing said on Monday its software patch would incorporate more than one angle of attack input, limit trim commands and limit authority but gave few details. “We’ve been working diligently and in close cooperation with the FAA on the software update. We are taking a comprehensive and careful approach to design, develop and test the software that will ultimately lead to certification,” a statement said. The change sheds light on Boeing’s previously reported decision to make the warning light a standard feature, since the change in flight control laws now makes it indispensable. The third person said Boeing would need to give pilots in their training a full explanation of what the fix is and why it is being implemented. Both the software fix and the training have to be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. Other methods for holding the nose of the aircraft in the right position, known as manual or electric trim, are unchanged as is the ability to cut out the automated trim system altogether using a standard step-by-step checklist. Boeing has previously said that existing crew procedures, which include using a pair of cut-out switches, would have addressed a condition known as a stabilizer trim runaway and by doing so, automatically deal with any problem with MCAS. But it has faced criticism for designing a system that potentially out-runs the ability of pilots to recover by repeatedly forcing the nose down using hefty forces, as the pilots in the doomed Lion Air flight experienced.

"ADDIS ABABA/WASHINGTON   - The crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane that killed 157 people had “clear similarities” with October’s Lion Air crash, Ethiopia said on Sunday, shown by initial analysis of the black boxes recovered from the wreckage of the March 10 disaster. The crash has generated one of the most widely watched and high-stakes inquiries for years, with the latest version of Boeing’s profitable 737 workhorse depending on the outcome. Both planes were MAX 8s, and both crashed minutes post take-off after pilots reported flight control problems. Concern over the plane’s safety led aviation authorities to ground the model, wiping billions of dollars off Boeing’s market value.     “It was the same case with the Indonesian (Lion Air) one. There were clear similarities between the two crashes so far,” Ethiopian transport ministry spokesman Muse Yiheyis said. “The data was successfully recovered. Both the American team and our (Ethiopian) team validated it,” he told Reuters, adding that the ministry would provide more information after three or four days. In Washington, however, U.S. officials told Reuters the FAA and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had not yet validated the data.  Boeing’s safety analysis of a new flight control system known as MCAS on MAX jets had several crucial flaws, one of which was that it understated the power of the system, the Seattle Times said on Sunday. The FAA also did not delve in detailed inquiries and followed a standard certification process on the MAX, the paper said, citing an FAA spokesman. The FAA declined to comment on the report but referred to previous statements about the certification process. It has said the process followed FAA’s standard process. Citing people familiar with the inquiry, the Wall Street Journal said Department of Transportation officials are scrutinizing the FAA’s approval of MAX jets and a Washington, D.C. grand jury issued a subpoena to at least one person involved in the MAX’s development. The subpoena dated March 11 - a day after the Ethiopian Airlines crash - listed as a contact a prosecutor from the Justice Department’s (DoJ) criminal division and sought documents to be handed over later this month, the paper said. It was not immediately clear whether the DoJ subpoena was related to the DoT’s inquiry, which focuses on MCAS, implicated in the Lion Air crash that killed 189 people, the WSJ added. Boeing and the FAA declined to comment on the WSJ report. Two government officials briefed on the matter told Reuters it would not be surprising for the Transportation Department to investigate a major safety issue, but could not immediately confirm the report. An official told Reuters that when investigators - after reviewing black box data from the Ethiopian Airlines crash - return to Addis Ababa to conduct interpretive work, the NTSB and FAA will assist in verification and validation of the data. A second source said little information had been circulated  between parties about the contents of data and voice recordings. It was not clear how many of the roughly 1,800 parameters of flight data and two hours of cockpit recordings, spanning the doomed six-minute flight and earlier trips, had been taken into account in the preliminary Ethiopian analysis. International rules require a preliminary report on the crash to be released within 30 days. Previous air crash reports show that in such high-profile cases there can be disagreements among parties about the cause. In Paris, France’s BEA air accident investigation agency said data from the jet’s cockpit voice recorder had been successfully downloaded. The French agency said on Twitter it had not listened to the audio files and the data had been transferred to Ethiopian investigators. In Addis Ababa, a source who has listened to the air traffic control recording of the plane’s communications said flight 302 had an unusually high speed after take-off before it reported problems and asked permission to climb quickly. Last Monday, Boeing, shares of which have fallen 10 percent in the week since the crash, said it would deploy a software upgrade to the 737 MAX 8, hours after the FAA said it would mandate “design changes” in the aircraft by April. Boeing was finalizing the software change and a training revision and would evaluate new information as it became available, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement on Sunday, after the Ethiopian transport ministry’s comments.   A Boeing spokesman said the 737 MAX was certified in line with identical FAA requirements and processes that governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives. The spokesman said the FAA concluded that MCAS on 737 MAX met all certification and regulatory requirements.

"WASHINGTON   - U.S. consumer prices rose for the first time in four months in February, but the pace of the increase was modest, resulting in the smallest annual gain in nearly 2-1/2 years. The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday also showed benign underlying inflation last month, which together with slowing economic growth support the Federal Reserve’s “patient” approach towards further interest rate increases this year. “We view the risks to the inflation outlook as weighted to the downside as the domestic economy has slowed more quickly than we had expected,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “The Fed is on pause for the foreseeable future.” The Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent, lifted by gains in the costs of food, gasoline and rents. The CPI had been unchanged for three straight months.  In the 12 months through February, the CPI rose 1.5 percent, the smallest gain since September 2016. The CPI increased 1.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in January. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent, the smallest increase since August 2018. The so-called core CPI had increased by 0.2 percent for five straight months.  In the 12 months through February, the core CPI rose 2.1 percent. The core CPI had increased by 2.2 percent for three consecutive months on an annual basis.  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI and the core CPI edging up 0.2 percent in February. The Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, tracks a different measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, for monetary policy. The core PCE price index increased 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in December after a similar gain in November. It hit the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent inflation target in March last year for the first time since April 2012. The economy lost momentum at the end of last year, a trend that appears to have persisted through early 2019, with manufacturing production plunging and retail sales rising slightly in January after December’s sharp drop.  First-quarter growth estimates have been cut to as low as a 0.2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter.  Slowing domestic and global growth are keeping inflation in check even as a tight labor market is driving up wages. Annual wage growth jumped 3.4 percent in February, the biggest increase since April 2009, from 3.1 percent in January. “That is partly because a modest pick-up in productivity growth has kept a lid on unit labor costs and partly because the rising dollar has started to put downward pressure on imported goods prices,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, but Boeing’s fall for a second straight session pressured the Dow Jones Industrial Average and capped gains in broader markets. The dollar slipped against a basket currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. A New York Fed survey of consumer expectations published on Monday showed a drop in inflation expectations in February. In a wide-ranging interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes television news program, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Sunday reiterated the central bank’s wait-and-see approach to further monetary policy tightening this year. Powell said the Fed did “not feel any hurry” to change the level of interest rates again. The Fed hiked rates four times in 2018. The January PCE price data will be released on March 19 after being delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. In February, gasoline prices rose 1.5 percent after three straight monthly declines. Food prices increased 0.4 percent, the biggest rise since May 2014, after gaining 0.2 percent in January. Food consumed at home rose 0.4 percent last month, boosted by more expensive dairy products, fresh vegetables, cereals and meat. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3 percent in February, as it did in January. Apparel prices rose 0.3 percent after surging 1.1 percent in January. Consumers paid more for motor vehicle insurance, airline fares, household furnishings and personal care products. But consumers got some relief from healthcare costs, which fell 0.2 percent after five straight monthly increases. Healthcare costs were held down by a record 1.0 percent decline in the price of prescription medication and a 0.7 percent drop in the cost of hospital services.  Prices for new motor vehicles, used cars and trucks, as well as recreation fell. Some economists believed the declines in healthcare and motor vehicle prices were temporary, noting that these two categories tended to be volatile, and expected the core CPI to tick higher in the months ahead. “I don’t think the softness this month is a harbinger of slower inflation in the next few months,” said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein in New York.

"NEW YORK   - Global equity markets surged on Monday, lifted by talk of more stimulus from China and by a broad rally on Wall Street that overcame a plunge in Boeing shares after one of its newest jets crashed, while U.S. debt yields rose on improved risk appetite. China’s main bourses clawed back almost half the 4 percent they lost on Friday as the country’s central bank chief pledged billions of dollars of cuts to taxes and fees to shore up an economy growing at its slowest pace in almost three decades. U.S. stocks followed strong gains in Europe with the tech-heavy Nasdaq rising 2 percent and the benchmark S&P more than 1 percent after Wall Street posted losses every day last week. MSCI’s gauge of global markets posted its biggest gain in seven weeks while European shares notched their best day in four weeks.  “This market, it comes in waves. Everybody who missed the rally in January and February is looking to buy the dip,” said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader who is head of market structure at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. “It’s buy the dip, it’s back,” Dick said. The rally on Wall Street given the decline in Boeing’s shares was especially impressive, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. “It’s a very strong sign of overall market strength,” James said. “After the weakness in the markets last week, things have gotten a little bit oversold,” he said. The Dow rebounded after Boeing Co, the index’s best performing component this year, pared steep losses after some airlines grounded the company’s new 737 MAX 8 passenger jet following a second deadly crash of the airliner in five months. Boeing shares dropped 5.3 percent, paring losses of about 13.5 percent shortly after the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 200.64 points, or 0.79 percent, to 25,650.88. The S&P 500 gained 40.23 points, or 1.47 percent, to 2,783.3 and the Nasdaq Composite added 149.92 points, or 2.02 percent, to 7,558.06. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.76 percent, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.2 percent. European shares rose on merger chatter in the battered banking sector, which along with talk of new Chinese stimulus, helped ease worries over a slowdown in the global economy. In China, the Shanghai Composite index rose 1.92 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 gained 1.98 percent. The dollar weakened after mixed U.S. retail sales data and sterling jumped as investors braced for parliamentary votes on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal that could decide the terms on which Britain leaves the European Union. May’s failure to win last-minute concessions from the European bloc regarding the Irish border set the stage for another humiliating defeat in parliament. Sterling fell in early trade but later erased its losses to trade at $1.3145, up 1.0 percent on the day. The dollar index fell 0.11 percent, with the euro up 0.05 percent to $1.1244. The Japanese yen weakened 0.09 percent versus the greenback at 111.24 per dollar. Norway’s crown gained after strong inflation data  raised interest rate hike expectations, with some strategists saying a March move by the Norges Bank was a done deal. With market volatility low, investors have rushed to buy currencies where central banks are still raising rates or economic data has pointed to a brighter economic outlook. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 5/32 in price to yield 2.6411 percent. Oil prices rose 1 percent on Monday, lifted by comments from Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih that an end to OPEC-led supply cuts was unlikely before June. U.S. crude rose 72 cents to settle at $56.79 per barrel and Brent settled 84 cents higher at $66.58.  Gold fell, moving further off the key $1,300-per-ounce mark it briefly surpassed last week.  U.S. gold futures settled 0.6 percent lower at $1,291.10 an ounce.

"  - China and Indonesia have grounded Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by their airlines in reaction to the fatal crash of a plane of the same type operated by Ethiopian Airlines on Sunday.  Ethiopian Airlines has also grounded its MAX 8 jets.  Boeing has said the investigation into the crash remains in its early stages and it has no basis to issue new guidance to operators. Other airlines continue to operate the narrowbody jet. Here is what airlines and regulators have said so far: “We have offered our assistance and are following closely the investigation. We have operated this aircraft type since 2017 and currently have 24 in our fleet. These aircraft have performed excellently from a safety, reliability and customer satisfaction perspective.” The company said it remained fully confident in the aircraft and that it was closely monitoring the investigation.     The Vietnamese airline, which announced last month it was in talks to buy 25 Boeing 737 planes, declined to comment.    The regulator said it was not grounding the aircraft and that it was following the investigation.  The airline said it had grounded both of its MAX 8 jets until it got more information on the crash. The regulator grounded 96 MAX 8s including those operated by Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines. The South African airline said it would monitor investigations into Sunday’s crash. It has ordered eight models of the aircraft and took delivery of the first one last month.  The airline said it was confident in the jet.     “We are monitoring the situation and continue to be in touch with Boeing. We remain confident in the airworthiness of our fleet. The safety of our passengers and crew is our first priority.”    The regulator said it would issue additional safety instructions to Indian carriers operating the MAX 8. Jet Airways and SpiceJet Ltd operate the plane.  South Korea is conducting an emergency inspection on Eastar Jet’s two MAX 8 jets, a ministry official said. The airline could not immediately be reached for comment. The airline said it remained fully confident in the aircraft and was closely monitoring the investigation The Indian airline said all 13 of its MAX 8s were currently flying. “From our experience we can operate the aircraft safely.” “We are in contact with Boeing, the aircraft producer, on the operations of the Boeing 737 Max,” CEO Bilal Eksi tweeted.  “Flight safety is our priority. We are closely monitoring developments. We are carrying out all our operations by keeping flight safety at the highest level.”   “We are monitoring the situation closely and will not speculate on the cause of the incident at this time.

"BEIJING/SHANGHAI   - China’s aviation regulator on Monday grounded nearly 100 Boeing Co 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by its airlines, more than a quarter of the global fleet of the jets, after a deadly crash of one of the planes in Ethiopia.  However, a U.S. official said it was unclear what information the Chinese regulator was acting on because the investigation of Sunday’s crash, the second involving the latest version of the narrowbody jet, was in the early stages.  Speaking on condition of anonymity as the topic is sensitive, the U.S. official said there were no plans to follow suit, as the jet had a stellar safety record in the United States and there was a lack of information on what caused the Ethiopian crash.      Boeing, whose shares dropped 9 percent in U.S. pre-market trade, said the investigation remained in its early stages and it had no basis to issue new guidance to operators. It was unusual to ground a plane type unless a specific mechanical issue or component failure had been identified and could be inspected, said Andrew Herdman, director general of the  Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. “In this case it is not clear what the action item is, having done the suspension,” he said. “What is lacking now is what happened in this case. “That means finding the black boxes and piecing together other circumstantial evidence from air traffic control recordings and so on.” Most other Boeing 737 MAX operators globally told Reuters their planes would keep flying and they had no plans to cancel orders. Sunday’s crash, minutes after take-off, of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 bound for Nairobi, killed all 157 on board and prompted the carrier to ground the rest of its 737 MAX jets. In October, a 737 MAX 8 operated by Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air crashed 13 minutes after take-off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on a domestic flight, killing all 189 on board. The 737 MAX 8 first entered service in 2017.  The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said it would notify airlines when they could resume flying the jets, after contacting Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure flight safety. “Given that two accidents both involved newly delivered Boeing 737-8 planes and happened during take-off phase, they have some degree of similarity,” the CAAC said, adding the step was in line with its principle of zero tolerance of safety hazards. The 737 MAX 8 is sometimes referred to as the 737-8. The grounding was due to safety concerns and not related to trade friction between the United States and China, Li Jian, the deputy head of the Chinese regulator, told reporters, the Yangcheng Evening News said. “These are two separate issues,” the newspaper, which is backed by the government of the southern province of Guangdong, quoted Li as saying on the sidelines of a parliament meeting in Beijing.      Chinese airlines have 96 737 MAX 8 jets in service, the state company regulator said on Twitter-like Weibo, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines. Chinese aviation data firm Variflight said at least 29 international and domestic flights on Monday had been canceled and that airlines had swapped out the plane on 256 other flights that had been scheduled to use it. China Eastern’s chairman, Liu Shaoyong, told financial publication Caixin on the sidelines of the Beijing meeting that it would only consider resuming 737 MAX 8 flights once Boeing issued a safety commitment for the jets and proved there was no aircraft design link between the two crashes.  The cause of the Indonesian crash is still being investigated. A November preliminary report, before the retrieval of the cockpit voice recorder, focused on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but gave no reason for the crash.  Ethiopian Airlines said it had grounded its 737 MAX 8 fleet until further notice as an “extra safety precaution” even though it did not know the cause of Sunday’s crash. The airline has a remaining fleet of four of the aircraft, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 says. Cayman Airways said it had grounded both of its new 737 MAX 8 jets until it got more information. But no other airlines with 737 MAX 8s in their fleets or on order, or their regulators, told Reuters they were grounding the aircraft or cancelling orders. By January-end, Boeing had delivered 350 of the 737 MAX family jets to customers, with 4,661 more on order. Western industry sources say China has been at pains in recent years to assert its independence as a safety regulator as it negotiates mutual safety standard recognition with regulators in the United States and Europe. In 2017, it signed a mutual recognition deal with the FAA, but industry sources say it has struggled to gain approval from the FAA that would allow it to sell its self-developed C919 airliner to Western airlines. The grounding was “reasonable and justified”, said Chinese aviation expert Li Xiaojin but added that he did not anticipate a major problem, as Chinese airlines operated fewer than 100 of the aircraft, among a combined fleet of more than 2,000 planes.

"OSLO   - Norwegian Air’s shares fell sharply on Monday as investors worried over weaker-than-expected passenger income and the potential impact of the crash of an Ethiopian Air Boeing 737 MAX 8 passenger jet the previous day. While Norwegian said its ‘MAX’ aircraft fleet remained in operation, China’s aviation regulator grounded nearly 100 similar jets operated by the country’s airlines. Norwegian Air had 18 ‘MAX’ jets in its fleet of 164 aircraft at the end of 2018 and is expected to take delivery of dozens more in coming years, taking the total to more than 70 by the end of 2021, the company has said in recent announcements. The move by China, and the possibility the ban could spread to other countries, was the main point to focus on for investors, brokers Pareto Securities said in a research note. “We expect the share to trade down today,” it said ahead of the market open. Ethiopia also halted the use of the ‘MAX’, as did Cayman Airways, even though aircraft maker Boeing said it saw no need to change its guidance for use of the plane. Norwegian’s shares fell 8.2 percent in early trade before a partial recovery to trade down 4.8 percent at 0952 GMT. The Oslo-based carrier has raised 3 billion Norwegian crowns ($345 million) from shareholders in recent months and said it would cut costs and curb its rapid growth to regain profitability. Norwegian, which has bet heavily on the transatlantic market, last week completed a share issue first announced in January, and said demand had exceeded its sale by 110 percent as the deep discount on offer attracted investors. “With a stronger financial position and lower cost going forward, we are well positioned to continue to attract new customers, not least in the long-haul market,” Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos said in a statement on Monday. Norwegian’s yield, a measure of revenue per passenger carried and kilometers flown, grew to 0.32 Norwegian crowns from 0.31 crowns a year earlier, while a Reuters poll expected a rise to 0.33 crowns. Its capacity expansion, as measured by available seat kilometers (ASK), peaked at 51 percent growth year-on-year last June but has since declined, hitting 15 percent in February, less than the 19.2 percent that analysts forecast. Load factor, a measure of how many seats are sold on each flight, fell to 81.5 percent for the month, beating a forecast of 80.6 percent but down from 84.3 percent a year earlier. In a further boost to its profits and balance sheet, Norwegian said its fuel hedge contracts had so far this year resulted in gains of 917 million Norwegian crowns, partly reversing losses sustained last year. British Airways owner IAG, which in 2018 attempted to buy Norwegian, last week said it would not rule out another bid but added that it was unlikely.

"PARIS   - Airbus has begun lining up tentative orders for a longer-range version of its A321 jetliner, seeking to exploit signs of hesitation at arch-rival Boeing over whether to develop a new model in a hotly contested niche of the airplane market. The European firm is in detailed talks with airlines over the price and timing of the longer-range design - known as A321XLR - and has penciled in some orders subject to a formal launch later this year, industry sources said. Airbus is looking for 200-300 draft orders before committing to build the A321XLR, aiming to limit the space available for a mid-market alternative that Boeing hopes to launch in a gap between medium-haul and long-haul jets. “Every A321XLR that Airbus sells, means one less potential sale for the NMA (Boeing’s proposed New Mid-sized Airplane),” an industry source said. An Airbus spokesman said the planemaker is “always talking to customers” and declined further comment. The middle of the jet market is at the center of one of the most widely watched airplane battles for years, with potential sales valued at hundreds of billions of dollars over 20 years. Boeing is aiming its potential new 220 to 260-seat NMA at a niche previously served by two models: its own 757, a long-range single-aisle jet, and its 767, a larger twin-aisle model. Boeing dominates the upper end of that spectrum but has come under mounting pressure from Airbus at the lower end. Last month it postponed a decision on whether to launch the NMA to 2020 from 2019, though it said it could still decide whether to offer the plane on a preliminary basis this year. It maintained its goal of seeing any new jet enter service in 2025. Facing a potential new competitor, Airbus plans a defensive pincer move with derivatives of two existing models: the A321neo and its souped-up sister versions - the A321LR and the proposed A321XLR - at the lower end and an upgraded A330 at the top end. Unlike the smaller A321neo, the upgraded A330neo has been selling poorly but received a hefty Emirates order last week. The A321XLR would have a higher maximum take-off weight of 101 tonnes and 400-500 nautical miles more range than the 4,000-mile A321LR, Airbus’ longest-range single-aisle. Under current plans, it would not carry any extra passengers, sources said. That’s where rival Boeing could decide to hit back. Experts say Boeing will likely argue that such a plane would have worse economics. That’s because its special new fuel tanks would make the jet heavier and costlier to fly, but without the compensation of extra seats. That would drive up operating costs per seat, the airline industry’s most important yardstick. But Airbus is gambling that some airlines will be swayed by earlier availability - with the A321XLR reaching the market 2-3 years before the NMA - and greater certainty as Boeing takes its time to evaluate the business case for its ambitious new jet. Its strategy is to try to pick off one or two potential NMA customers, especially in the United States, and encourage Boeing to think again about launching a jet that could disrupt the market and dent a record run of sales for the A321 family. Boeing has said its potential new plane will fly similar ranges or more but with greater comfort and at a lower cost.  “The XLR is not in the same ballpark,” a U.S. source said.

"PARIS   - Airbus is nearing a decision to ax production of the world’s largest airliner amid a downward revision in demand from the Gulf and is likely to give an update with its full-year earnings on Feb. 14, industry sources and analysts said. The move to shut production of the A380 superjumbo earlier than expected coincides with a review of purchases of very large aircraft by the plane’s biggest customer, Emirates, which has a fleet of 109 superjumbos and 53 left on order. Due to weaker demand, the Dubai carrier is expected to scale down these purchases and place greater focus on smaller models in a shake-up that could have implications for both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing, industry sources said. Airbus and Emirates declined to comment. The fate of the A380 superjumbo has been in doubt since a vital order from Emirates foundered over inconclusive engine talks, forcing the two sides to weigh an alternative that would trigger a premature halt to A380 production. Emirates is by the largest customer for the 544-seat aircraft and analysts say production is unsustainable beyond 2020 without the new Emirates order. Under the proposed reshuffle, first reported by Reuters, Airbus hopes to broker a deal that would see Emirates switch part of its order to smaller models like the A350 or A330, while eking out a few last-minute A380 orders from British Airways. The timing of any final announcement may be driven by the outcome of those talks, but Airbus will be under pressure to provide some clarity on its plans in time for Thursday’s earnings following mounting speculation over the plane’s future. “The A380 is the elephant in the hangar; it will be impossible to avoid saying something on the subject,” said Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa. The A380 is already on life support due to weak sales.  Any decision to pull the plug on the iconic European double-decker after just 12 years in service must be approved by the Airbus board, which meets on Wednesday.  The prospect of shutting output comes at an awkward moment for Airbus as rival Boeing celebrates the 50th anniversary of its 747 jumbo - the jet that revolutionized long-haul travel and which Europe’s A380 was designed to squeeze out of the market. The 747 survives mainly as a freighter and VIP transport, whereas a planned cargo version of the A380 has already been axed due to lack of interest and the sole VIP version of the A380 sold to a Saudi prince was canceled several years ago. That left the A380 reliant solely on passenger demand at a time when advances in twin-engined jets like the Boeing 777 and A350 made four-engined models like the A380 less popular.

"BRASILIA   - Brazil national security adviser Augusto Heleno said on Monday that the government is studying whether the deal between planemakers Embraer (EMBR3.SA) and Boeing (BA.N) is in its “ideal form” or in need of changes.      Embraer in December agreed to sell 80 percent of its commercial aviation business to Boeing for $4.2 billion. The deal requires the government’s blessing to go forward.  Heleno, speaking to reporters at a press conference, added that the government was not “thinking of interrupting negotiations.” He said the government wants a deal that will be “the best possible for the country.” President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday expressed concern about a provision in the agreement that would allow Boeing to end up with 100 percent of the commercial division business, extinguishing Embraer’s participation. He described the Brazilian planemaker, which is a private company, as part of the national “patrimony” and said he did not want to see it “pass to the other side,” in a reference to full Boeing ownership.     Before becoming president, Bolsonaro and his advisers spoke favorably of the Boeing-Embraer deal, but without addressing specific details.
