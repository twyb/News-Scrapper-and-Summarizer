"Some of Hong Kong’s busiest shopping districts have descended into chaos after police used teargas, rubber bullets, pepper spray and water cannon against protesters.Activists hurled bricks and petrol bombs back at the police and started street fires on Sunday as demonstrations entered their 17th week in the city’s most serious political crisis in decades.The protest, which was not sanctioned, was scheduled to start at 3pm local time (0800 BST) in the Causeway Bay shopping district, but dozens of riot police began guarding the area hours before. They stopped and searched a number of young people dressed in black.The crowds chanted “Black cop! Black cop!” as they saw riot police. At about 2.20pm, before the march was due to start, officers fired several rounds of teargas at crowds congregating in front of the Sogo department store. Police had earlier subdued several protesters and angered the crowds.Protesters targeted by teargas ran in panic, but many began marching along the scheduled route towards Admiralty, a business district where the government headquarters is located.Some protesters regrouped outside the headquarters and threw bricks and petrol bombs at officers. Riot police later fired rounds of teargas at protesters outside an upmarket shopping centre in Admiralty and near the government headquarters. They also used water cannon to spray protesters with water mixed with blue dye and stinging chemicals.Dozens of protesters were arrested after being chased by police, with many tackled to the ground and some left bleeding heavily. A number of protesters were also made to line up against the wall on the main road.As activists retreated from Admiralty, some made makeshift barricades and set them ablaze. Street fires were also started in the Wan Chai district in an attempt to stop the police from approaching.Some protesters later threw petrol bombs at police who had entered Wan Chai metro station, the public broadcaster RTHK reported. It also said undercover police wearing black clothing typical of protesters were seen retreating into the station with the help of uniformed officers. Police have admitted sending officers disguised as protesters to carry out operations during demonstrations.A young man in full protective gear said: “I don’t want violence either, but the authorities are using hardline measures against us, so I’m fighting against them with my life.”After dark, more clashes took place and police again fired multiple rounds of teargas. Large groups of riot police encroached on a diminishing group of protesters in Causeway Bay after a water cannon put out fires.Dozens of protesters marched towards a large group of riot police, prompting officers to deploy teargas.Later in the evening, police left the scene in vans as protesters jeered at them. Some activists threw sticks and bricks and a police vehicle stopped to fire two rounds of teargas. More teargas was fired late at night in Wan Chai, local media reported.Earlier in the day, helicopters had hovered above the protest areas as demonstrators opened their umbrellas, saying they feared an unknown liquid was being sprayed at them.A number of middle-aged people said they were there to protect young protesters.“These kids feel hopeless and they’re willing to give their lives even – they need us to protect them,” said Vanita Chan, 55, who said she had bought supplies such as saline, goggles and raincoats to hand out to protesters.A woman identified only as Mrs Lau, 56, said: “If we don’t speak up now there won’t be another opportunity, the Hong Kong and Chinese governments are cracking down on us already.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong“We don’t want our next generation to lose our freedoms. We don’t accept one country, one system.” This was a reference to China’s agreement to give Hong Kong semi-autonomy – “one country, two systems” – after taking control of the city back from the UK in 1997.Many shops in the area closed. Protesters spray-painted a closed Starbucks cafe in Wan Chai with messages calling on people to boycott it. The company that runs the cafe chain in Hong Kong is seen by protesters as being pro-Beijing.Young protesters wearing black were digging up paving stones at a crossroads in Wan Chai while others smashed glass panels at a metro exit of Wan Chai station, which has been closed. The outer walls of the exit were also spray-painted with anti-police messages and “Free HK”, “Reclaim HK, revolution of our era”.Protesters are angry that in past weeks, the metro company has allowed police to go into the station to beat protesters and close it during protests, but has provided carriages to transport riot police officers.Hong Kong has been gripped by a wave of protests since June, sparked by a controversial extradition bill, but the movement has become increasingly violent as animosity has grown between protesters and police.Hong Kong is bracing for consecutive days of protests and clashes, culminating with anti-government demonstrations on Tuesday to coincide with China’s National Day, marking 70 years since the founding of the People’s Republic of China.",Hong Kong

"Rival groups of demonstrators clashed in Hong Kong and police made arrests in another weekend of mass protests after months of political unrest.Dozens of pro-Beijing protesters waved Chinese flags and chanted “support the police” at a mall in Kowloon Bay on Saturday, as pro-democracy demonstrators gathered, clad in black and wearing masks. After a standoff, members of the two sides began to fight, throwing punches and hitting each other with umbrellas before police separated them. At least one man was seen bleeding from the head.Groups of protesters shouted at each other and scuffled by a nearby “Lennon wall” – murals of protest art set up by demonstrators. Police were seen tackling and subduing several people, some of whom said they were local residents going to the mall.As Hong Kong enters its fourth month of mass protests, tensions between supporters and critics of the pro-democracy movement have escalated. Earlier on Saturday, fights broke out between a group of pro-government demonstrators in blue T-shirts and residents in Fortress Hill after a Lennon wall had been torn down.Videos showed groups of men using Chinese flags to beat mostly younger men. In one scene, a group chased and kicked a young man until a passerby shielded him with his body. Hong Kong’s hospital authority said 25 people were treated after Saturday’s clashes.Hundreds of anti-government protesters in masks and all-black outfits were also marching in Tin Shui Wai, a neighbourhood in Hong Kong’s New Territories, defying a police ban on the planned event. Bus lines to the area were shut, as riot police faced off against protesters who blocked roads and built barricades on the streets, paralysing traffic.Saturday marks the 15th consecutive weekend of mass protests in Hong Kong, where demonstrations against the government have deeply divided society. The protests, triggered by an extradition bill that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China, has turned into a broader pro-democracy movement.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said that she will permanently withdraw the bill, but protesters have vowed to continue until all their demands are met. On Friday, thousands of protesters marked the mid-autumn festival by forming human chains across the city. Hundreds hiked to several peaks where they shined lanterns and torches.Hundreds of secondary school students gathered in central Hong Kong, where they sang Glory to Hong Kong, a song that has become the unofficial anthem of the protests, and stuck signs and posted messages along a wall.“I’m showing up to support the younger generation,” said Cheng, 21, a university student attending the rally of secondary students. “Just because one demand was fulfilled doesn’t mean we should back down. We should keep fighting for all five of the demands.”He said: “There are a lot less people showing up to these kinds of protests and gathering, and I hope Hong Kong people will still remember what happened within these three months.”During the past week, demonstrators have gathered in malls across the city to sing the anthem, in a departure from previous weeks of violent street battles with police.Observers believe authorities are eager to stop the protests before 1 October, when China celebrates its national day, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.Many protesters believe it is a key date to apply more pressure on the government. One group has raised more than HK$8m (£820,000) to place adverts in the main newspapers on that day.At a press conference given by protesters earlier in the day, demonstrators warned they would “escalate their ways” if the government continues to refuse their demands, which include an independent inquiry into police behaviour and democratic reforms to establish universal suffrage.Protesters planned to come out again on Sunday, in defiance of a police ban on a march organised by the Civil Human Rights Front, an advocacy group that has organised several peaceful rallies in the past. Others planned to march on the British Consulate, to call on the UK to act on behalf of the former British colony.Some worry that as school has started, the protests have lost momentum as fewer people have come out to the protests in the last few weeks. “Those who ever wavered might back down sadly,” said William, 29, a protester in Tin Shui Wai, who said he was disappointed with the number of people that turned out but would continue himself.“I have to. I don’t want to miss out on history,” he said. “We have to keep it up. The revolution has started, and we must win.”",Hong Kong enters 15th week of mass protests as unrest continues,2019-09-14/12:09:18,rival groups of demonstrators clashed in hong kong and police made arrests in another weekend of mass protests after months of political unrest dozens of pro beijing protesters waved chinese flags and chanted support the police at a mall in kowloon bay on saturday as pro democracy demonstrators gathered clad in black and wearing masks after a standoff members of the two sides began to fight throwing punches and hitting each other with umbrellas before police separated them at least one man was seen bleeding from the head groups of protesters shouted at each other and scuffled by a nearby lennon wall murals of protest art set up by demonstrators police were seen tackling and subduing several people some of whom said they were local residents going to the mall as hong kong enters its fourth month of mass protests tensions between supporters and critics of the pro democracy movement have escalated earlier on saturday fights broke out between a group of pro government demonstrators in blue t shirts and residents in fortress hill after a lennon wall had been torn down videos showed groups of men using chinese flags to beat mostly younger men in one scene a group chased and kicked a young man until a passerby shielded him with his body hong kong s hospital authority said  people were treated after saturday s clashes hundreds of anti government protesters in masks and all black outfits were also marching in tin shui wai a neighbourhood in hong kong s new territories defying a police ban on the planned event bus lines to the area were shut as riot police faced off against protesters who blocked roads and built barricades on the streets paralysing traffic saturday marks the th consecutive weekend of mass protests in hong kong where demonstrations against the government have deeply divided society the protests triggered by an extradition bill that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland china has turned into a broader pro democracy movement hong kong s leader carrie lam has said that she will permanently withdraw the bill but protesters have vowed to continue until all their demands are met on friday thousands of protesters marked the mid autumn festival by forming human chains across the city hundreds hiked to several peaks where they shined lanterns and torches hundreds of secondary school students gathered in central hong kong where they sang glory to hong kong a song that has become the unofficial anthem of the protests and stuck signs and posted messages along a wall i m showing up to support the younger generation said cheng  a university student attending the rally of secondary students just because one demand was fulfilled doesn t mean we should back down we should keep fighting for all five of the demands he said there are a lot less people showing up to these kinds of protests and gathering and i hope hong kong people will still remember what happened within these three months during the past week demonstrators have gathered in malls across the city to sing the anthem in a departure from previous weeks of violent street battles with police observers believe authorities are eager to stop the protests before  october when china celebrates its national day the th anniversary of the founding of the people s republic of china many protesters believe it is a key date to apply more pressure on the government one group has raised more than hk m   to place adverts in the main newspapers on that day at a press conference given by protesters earlier in the day demonstrators warned they would escalate their ways if the government continues to refuse their demands which include an independent inquiry into police behaviour and democratic reforms to establish universal suffrage protesters planned to come out again on sunday in defiance of a police ban on a march organised by the civil human rights front an advocacy group that has organised several peaceful rallies in the past others planned to march on the british consulate to call on the uk to act on behalf of the former british colony some worry that as school has started the protests have lost momentum as fewer people have come out to the protests in the last few weeks those who ever wavered might back down sadly said william  a protester in tin shui wai who said he was disappointed with the number of people that turned out but would continue himself i have to i don t want to miss out on history he said we have to keep it up the revolution has started and we must win ,Hong Kong Protests,0.423426211
"Hong Kong riot police have fired teargas, sponge rounds and arrested a number of protesters, including two 13-year-olds, as peaceful demonstrations in several districts turned ugly at the end of the 15th week of unrest in the city’s drawn-out political crisis.The police-sanctioned demonstration attended by thousands in Tuen Mun on Saturday afternoon was initially peaceful but later erupted into violent conflicts between protesters and riot police armed with teargas, pepper spray and shields. Police moved in to dismantle makeshift barricades set up by demonstrators, while protesters retaliated by throwing petrol bombs and setting some of the barricades on fire. Police said on Twitter that “radical protesters” possessed “offensive weapons including metal rods, slingshots and laser guns” during the confrontations.The Hong Kong government issued a statement shortly after midnight condemning the protester’s “violent and vandalistic acts”. It said the police would act to restore public order.Scuffles also broke out between the police and protesters near a light-rail station after demonstrators were accused of shining laser pointers at officers. They used fire hoses to spray water while police retaliated with pepper spray and fired several rounds of sponge bullets at them. Police later said on Twitter that the protesters had damaged station facilities with metal rods and hurled objects on to the tracks.Earlier, protesters near Tuen Mun town hall lowered the Chinese flag, trampled on it and set it on fire. A 13-year-old girl was later detained for desecrating the national flag, reported public broadcaster RTHK, citing police sources.Another demonstration started in the evening in the Yuen Long district to mark an indiscriminate attack carried out by pro-China gangsters on commuters at the local station two months ago.The protest, originally planned as a sit-in at the metro station, could not take place there after the city’s transit operator, MTR Corp, closed the station in the afternoon. But from around 8pm local time, hundreds of protesters filled the neighbouring shopping centre, chanted slogans and sang “Glory to Hong Kong” – an unofficial anthem of the protest movement.The atmosphere turned tense by late night after some demonstrators ventured out of the shopping complex and set up barricades on main thoroughfares in the area, bringing traffic to a standstill. Police flashed strong lights at protesters, who yelled profanities at officers from a footbridge. The crowds and police then got into a cat-and-mouse game across different streets in the area. Some protesters threw petrol bombs at police vehicles, before riot police charged at protesters and used teargas in retaliation.“Reclaim Hong Kong! Revolution of our era!” many protesters chanted, as they refused to leave the area despite the clouds of teargas and detention of demonstrators by officers. Meanwhile, dozens gathered on Sunday night outside the Prince Edward metro station in the Mong Kok district, where many believed people died when police attacked protesters and commuters inside a train carriage on 31 August. Some burned funeral offerings while others sang and chanted slogans.In the early hours of Sunday, police fired several rounds of tear gas from the police station in Tseung Kwan O - another out-of-town district - after dozens of protesters hurled projectiles at the station and set up makeshift barricades to block its exits. Police arrested a 13-year-old boy and a 19-year-old man for illegal assembly, reported RTHK. The boy, found carrying spray paint and a laser gun, was accused of allegedly possessing offensive weapon and tools for illegal purposes, it said.Earlier this month, the Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, withdrew the controversial anti-extradition bill that sparked the wave of protests in June, but the move failed to calm unrest.The protests had by then morphed into a wider and more violent anti-government movement as resentment mounted against the police and the government, which used threats and escalating force to deal with protesters. The bill, if passed, would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial.Earlier on Saturday, dozens of pro-China supporters tore down “Lennon Walls” of large collages of colourful anti-government protest messages in several districts.The installations have blossomed across Hong Kong, on and under footbridges, along pedestrian walkways, at bus stops and shopping centres. A pro-Beijing city legislator, Junius Ho, who has been a vocal critic of the protests, had urged his supporters to clean up the approximately 100 Lennon Walls around the city on Saturday.The anti-government protesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing on Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including the right of assembly and an independent judiciary.The demonstrations have turned ugly and tend to peak on the weekends, often with anti-government activists, many masked and in black, throwing petrol bombs at police, trashing metro stations, blocking airport roads and lighting street fires. At times, they have been confronted by counter-protesters who support Beijing.

"Clashes broke out between police and protesters in Hong Kong on Saturday after thousands took part in a peaceful march in an out-of-town district in Hong Kong.After the end of the Reclaim Sheung Shui protest against parallel traders who snap up goods such as foreign-made formula milk, medicines and soy sauce for reselling in China in the town near the mainland border, hundreds of protesters put on goggles, face masks and hard hats and occupied the streets around the train station, which had been cordoned off for the police-sanctioned demonstration earlier.The scene descended into chaos near a shopping centre shortly after 5pm local time. People rushed to rally outside a community hall, where a police van was parked and a protester was reportedly held by the police. Some dismantled roadside metal barriers and set up makeshift barricades and faced off with police officers on several streets.Police then raised red warning flags to order protesters to leave immediately. They later used pepper spray several times to disperse the crowds and beat some of the protesters with truncheons, who in turn used umbrellas to defend themselves.“Nasty police! Shame on you!” protesters chanted.A witness said he saw at least a dozen people injured by pepper spray and one person was bleeding after being beaten by a police baton.Many shops popular with parallel traders and mainland tourists closed in Sheung Shui, fearing being targeted by protesters. Some protesters took their anger out on a Bank of China branch, which they spray-painted, while others besieged a medicine shop, which was forced to close.The scene had calmed down somewhat by 8pm, when most of the protesters were leaving, but more than a hundred police officers in riot gear suddenly appeared at 8.10. Police went on to several streets and footbridges, apparently looking for protesters.Andrew Wan, a lawmaker, said he was hit by a policeman on his head with a baton and several members of the press were also reportedly hit and attacked by pepper spray. Local press reported that a teenager nearly fell off a footbridge after he was chased by police.As of 9.30pm, a large number of police officers in riot gear were still standing guard and many police vans were still parked around a shopping centre and train station where protesters had earlier congregated. Most of the protesters had left by then but police continued to stop passersby on a footbridge near the shopping centre to check their identity and search their bags.The Hong Kong government issued a statement shortly after midnight that while most protesters behaved in a peaceful and orderly manner, it “strongly condemns the violent acts committed” after the protest, including protesters blocking roads, charging police cordons, assaulting police officers and throwing iron rods and scattering unidentified powder.It also responded to the protest by saying it has already arrested a number of parallel traders and blocked some from entering Hong Kong and will continue to “mitigate the impact on the community brought by parallel trading activities”.Many interviewed by the Guardian earlier in the day said the millions-strong anti-extradition protests during the past month became a lightning rod for them.“Restore Sheung Shui to its former glory,” “Restore our serenity” and “Kick out parallel traders,” shouted many at the march earlier in the day.They said they resented the government for having turned a blind eye to the border town being overrun with parallel traders for more than a decade. They accused them of filling the streets with cardboard boxes of commodities and leaving behind piles of rubbish, while neighbourhood shops were squeezed out of business due to high rents and replaced by shops selling goods popular with mainland tourists and traders.“We didn’t use to bother coming out to air our grievances on local issues, but now that we realise that in unity, we can show our strength, there is no reason not to come out,” said Leona Ip, who lives in Yuen Long, another town frequented by mainland parallel traders. She also said the anti-extradition protests in the past month had emboldened her to fight for local issues which affect her community.Others described the huge anti-extradition protests as “an awakening” to remind them that China is also eroding Hong Kong’s way of life.",Protesters and police clash in Hong Kong after peaceful march,2019-07-13/14:36:01,clashes broke out between police and protesters in hong kong on saturday after thousands took part in a peaceful march in an out of town district in hong kong after the end of the reclaim sheung shui protest against parallel traders who snap up goods such as foreign made formula milk medicines and soy sauce for reselling in china in the town near the mainland border hundreds of protesters put on goggles face masks and hard hats and occupied the streets around the train station which had been cordoned off for the police sanctioned demonstration earlier the scene descended into chaos near a shopping centre shortly after pm local time people rushed to rally outside a community hall where a police van was parked and a protester was reportedly held by the police some dismantled roadside metal barriers and set up makeshift barricades and faced off with police officers on several streets police then raised red warning flags to order protesters to leave immediately they later used pepper spray several times to disperse the crowds and beat some of the protesters with truncheons who in turn used umbrellas to defend themselves nasty police shame on you protesters chanted a witness said he saw at least a dozen people injured by pepper spray and one person was bleeding after being beaten by a police baton many shops popular with parallel traders and mainland tourists closed in sheung shui fearing being targeted by protesters some protesters took their anger out on a bank of china branch which they spray painted while others besieged a medicine shop which was forced to close the scene had calmed down somewhat by pm when most of the protesters were leaving but more than a hundred police officers in riot gear suddenly appeared at   police went on to several streets and footbridges apparently looking for protesters andrew wan a lawmaker said he was hit by a policeman on his head with a baton and several members of the press were also reportedly hit and attacked by pepper spray local press reported that a teenager nearly fell off a footbridge after he was chased by police as of  pm a large number of police officers in riot gear were still standing guard and many police vans were still parked around a shopping centre and train station where protesters had earlier congregated most of the protesters had left by then but police continued to stop passersby on a footbridge near the shopping centre to check their identity and search their bags the hong kong government issued a statement shortly after midnight that while most protesters behaved in a peaceful and orderly manner it strongly condemns the violent acts committed after the protest including protesters blocking roads charging police cordons assaulting police officers and throwing iron rods and scattering unidentified powder it also responded to the protest by saying it has already arrested a number of parallel traders and blocked some from entering hong kong and will continue to mitigate the impact on the community brought by parallel trading activities many interviewed by the guardian earlier in the day said the millions strong anti extradition protests during the past month became a lightning rod for them restore sheung shui to its former glory restore our serenity and kick out parallel traders shouted many at the march earlier in the day they said they resented the government for having turned a blind eye to the border town being overrun with parallel traders for more than a decade they accused them of filling the streets with cardboard boxes of commodities and leaving behind piles of rubbish while neighbourhood shops were squeezed out of business due to high rents and replaced by shops selling goods popular with mainland tourists and traders we didn t use to bother coming out to air our grievances on local issues but now that we realise that in unity we can show our strength there is no reason not to come out said leona ip who lives in yuen long another town frequented by mainland parallel traders she also said the anti extradition protests in the past month had emboldened her to fight for local issues which affect her community others described the huge anti extradition protests as an awakening to remind them that china is also eroding hong kong s way of life ,Hong Kong Protests,0.396673709
"Hong Kong police have fired teargas and for the first time used a water cannon to disperse protesters as a weekend of violent clashes dashed hopes of a return to peace after a week of relative calm.Hundreds of thousands of people had earlier braved rain on Sunday to stage a peaceful, police-sanctioned march in Tsuen Wan, an area of the city noted for its links with triad gangsters, after clashes on Saturday when police fired teargas, rubber bullets, pepper balls and sponge rounds at protesters.By late afternoon on Sunday, about 100 riot police officers had formed into lines on two streets and protesters began to build makeshift barricades with plastic traffic barriers and bamboo rods in a standoff between the two sides. Just after 5.30pm local time police fired several rounds of teargas.The crowd largely stayed put behind the barricades in the midst of choking smoke and some threw gas canisters back at the police. Protesters also threw bricks and Molotov cocktails at the police, with flames seen on the road between the two sides.Minutes later, police launched another volley of teargas and charged at the protesters as the crowd dispersed. For the first time, police also used two anti-riot vehicles equipped with water cannons to chase away protesters.After the dispersal, protesters in small groups spread to several districts across the city late into the night, causing disruptions as they led the police in a game of cat and mouse.A group of protesters shone laser beams into the Sham Shui Po police station, before riot police arrested at least four of them, reported the public broadcaster RTHK. At Tsim Sha Tsui, an area popular with tourists, some set up barricades on the main thoroughfare with rubbish bins and a small fire was lit in bushes outside a police station, according to local media.Protesters also targeted a cross-harbour tunnel briefly late at night, using barriers to partially block traffic and sticks to smash lights, security cameras, and toll booth windows at an entrance. They fled after about 10 minutes, according to RTHK.In Tsuen Wan, an area with a high proportion of low-income mainland migrants and links to triad gangsters, where protesters had previously been attacked, a dozen men wielding metal poles and clad in white and blue tops appeared in the area, with some holding the Chinese national flag. They dispersed shortly after riot police intercepted.Police in Tsuen Wan also fired warning shots into the air after officers who charged at protesters were attacked with metal and bamboo poles and pointed their guns at a group of people including journalists, RTHK reported.The Hong Kong government said in a statement on Monday that it “severely condemns” the protesters. “The escalating illegal and violent acts of radical protesters are not only outrageous, they also push Hong Kong to the verge of a very dangerous situation.” It said police would “strictly follow up” on those acts.In a separate statement, police said they arrested 36 people on Sunday, aged 12 to 48, for unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapon and assaulting police officers.After almost three months of continuous protests, demonstrators said remained determined in their fight for political rights. They swore to continue their struggle as long as the government refused to heed their political demands.“The more the government ignores us, the more we have to come out,” said Peggy Tai, who is in her 60s, earlier in the day.The wave of protests, which started in early June to oppose an extradition bill under which individuals could be sent to mainland China for trial, has morphed into a broader anti-government movement.Demonstrators have five demands: the complete withdrawal of the now-suspended extradition bill; the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence; a halt to the characterisation of protests as “riots”; an amnesty for those arrested; and a resumption of political reform to allow the free election of Hong Kong’s leader and legislature.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, said earlier in the week that she would establish platforms for dialogue although protesters dismissed her offer and said she needed to respond to their demands.Police said 29 people were arrested on Saturday for unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons and assaulting police officers following the violent clashes, including Ventus Lau, the organiser of the peaceful march earlier in the day.“I fear less about being arrested than Hong Kong being stripped of our rights and freedom,” said a protester who identified himself as Rock. “We were wrong to stop fighting after the umbrella movement five years ago and so much has been taken away from us since. This time, we’re more determined.”This weekend’s violent confrontations took place after more than a week of mostly peaceful demonstrations in the semi-autonomous city. Last weekend there were the first teargas-free protests after organisers called for events to be peaceful and non-violent. A rally at Yuen Long station on Wednesday turned into a tense standoff between police and protesters but ended without violence. Another rally in the form of a human chain that stretched for kilometres on Friday also ended without incident.Activists have also planned a city-wide strike, a sit-in outside the tax office, a small scale rally in the central business district and a large protest next Saturday as well as class boycotts at universities and schools in coming weeks.",Hong Kong protests: police use water cannon on

"Thousands of pro-government protesters have rallied outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong as tensions rose on the eve of what is expected to be Hong Kong’s fourth mass protest in a month against a controversial extradition law.While top officials attend a ceremony on 1 July every year to mark the anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover of sovereignty from the UK to China, a large anti-government protest also takes place on the same day.A large turnout is expected on Monday, the 22nd anniversary of the handover, as the city is rocked by its biggest political crisis in decades. Millions have taken to the streets to protest against the proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals for trial in mainland China, where the opaque court system is controlled by the Communist party.The protests throughout June have been largely peaceful, but on 12 June, the scene turned violent when police used rubber bullets, teargas, pepper spray and batons to disperse crowds and some protesters threw objects back at the police. Protesters have also surrounded the police headquarters twice in past weeks in noisy and emotionally charged protests in which young people spray-painted obscenities on its front wall and barricaded its entrances.Police set up giant water-filled barricades in anticipation of overnight rallies by anti-extradition protesters to lock down the area where the handover anniversary ceremony is to take place.The pro-government protesters – mostly middle-aged and older people arriving on coaches – gathered at Tamar Park outside the Legislative Council and government headquarters from Sunday afternoon. Mostly dressed in blue and white, they waved Chinese national flags and placards with messages supporting the police, who have been under fire for their use of teargas and rubber bullets in anti-extradition protests.Angry exchanges took place on both sides when pro- and anti-government protesters met. “We were completely besieged by thousands of them at one point. They were very emotional – it felt really dangerous,” said an anti-extradition protester who gave his name as Jim.A number of journalists were spat at, had mud slung at them, and were kicked and insulted by protesters who accused them of being sympathetic to earlier anti-extradition protests.A pro-democracy lawmaker, Lam Cheuk-ting, was surrounded by dozens of protesters on a walkway near the legislature, some of whom used umbrellas or placards to assault him and tried to snatch his mobile phone.On early Sunday evening, groups of young anti-extradition protesters, mostly dressed in black, were stopped by police from going near the legislature. Police held their identity cards while ordering them to line up to wait to have their bags searched. Police officers questioned them loudly while taking videos of them and took their personal details before letting them go.Much of the artwork posted on walls near the legislature by anti-extradition protesters was torn down by government supporters as they passed.",Tension in Hong Kong on eve of anniversary of China handover,2019-07-01/00:52:02,thousands of pro government protesters have rallied outside the government headquarters in hong kong as tensions rose on the eve of what is expected to be hong kong s fourth mass protest in a month against a controversial extradition law while top officials attend a ceremony on  july every year to mark the anniversary of hong kong s handover of sovereignty from the uk to china a large anti government protest also takes place on the same day a large turnout is expected on monday the nd anniversary of the handover as the city is rocked by its biggest political crisis in decades millions have taken to the streets to protest against the proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals for trial in mainland china where the opaque court system is controlled by the communist party the protests throughout june have been largely peaceful but on  june the scene turned violent when police used rubber bullets teargas pepper spray and batons to disperse crowds and some protesters threw objects back at the police protesters have also surrounded the police headquarters twice in past weeks in noisy and emotionally charged protests in which young people spray painted obscenities on its front wall and barricaded its entrances police set up giant water filled barricades in anticipation of overnight rallies by anti extradition protesters to lock down the area where the handover anniversary ceremony is to take place the pro government protesters mostly middle aged and older people arriving on coaches gathered at tamar park outside the legislative council and government headquarters from sunday afternoon mostly dressed in blue and white they waved chinese national flags and placards with messages supporting the police who have been under fire for their use of teargas and rubber bullets in anti extradition protests angry exchanges took place on both sides when pro and anti government protesters met we were completely besieged by thousands of them at one point they were very emotional it felt really dangerous said an anti extradition protester who gave his name as jim a number of journalists were spat at had mud slung at them and were kicked and insulted by protesters who accused them of being sympathetic to earlier anti extradition protests a pro democracy lawmaker lam cheuk ting was surrounded by dozens of protesters on a walkway near the legislature some of whom used umbrellas or placards to assault him and tried to snatch his mobile phone on early sunday evening groups of young anti extradition protesters mostly dressed in black were stopped by police from going near the legislature police held their identity cards while ordering them to line up to wait to have their bags searched police officers questioned them loudly while taking videos of them and took their personal details before letting them go much of the artwork posted on walls near the legislature by anti extradition protesters was torn down by government supporters as they passed ,Hong Kong Protests,0.386105537
"Protesters and police have clashed in Hong Kong in another weekend of unrest as tensions escalate in the run-up to a significant political anniversary for Beijing.Riot police fired teargas, pepper spray and bean bag rounds on protesters who vandalised metro stations and set improvised barricades ablaze in several flashpoints across the city.The confrontations mark the 16th consecutive weekend of mass protest for the semi-autonomous Chinese territory and come less than 10 days before China celebrates its national day on 1 October, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.Earlier, residents had staged a peaceful rally at the New Town Plaza in Sha Tin, a key site of protests after police stormed the mall and clashed with protesters there in July. Demonstrators decorated the mall with origami paper cranes and hung banners from the railings. A small group of musicians wearing masks played the song Glory to Hong Kong, which has become the anthem of the protests.Scenes at the mall turned ugly as protesters surrounded a man and accused him of being a spy from mainland China and punched and kicked him. Video footage showed the man walking away from the group, bleeding from the head.Protesters at the mall trampled on the Chinese flag and painted it black before dumping it into a river while crowds gathered outside the mall, hurling bricks from an overpass at riot police who fired multiple rounds of teargas at them.Police also fired on demonstrators who gathered in the early evening in Mong Kok, in Kowloon, a frequent site of clashes between police and protesters during the last three months. The police said in a statement that “radical protesters” had thrown bricks at the local police station and set fires at road junctions, “endangering the safety of everyone at scene and seriously affecting traffic nearby”.Elsewhere, protesters unfurled a large banner with the words “Glory to Hong Kong” and residents supportive of the protesters came out to the streets to heckle police. In one incident, a police officer charged at residents gathered in Kawi Fong in northern Hong Kong, with his baton raised, before a colleague pulled him back.Protesters vandalised metro stations, smashing CCTV cameras and spray painting ticket machines. Protesters have begun to target Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway after the operator was seen as bowing to government pressure to close stations during protests, making it harder for demonstrators to escape or for others to join.Demonstrators have also been calling on the rail operator to release CCTV footage of arrests made on 31 August at the Prince Edward station in Kowloon believed to have turned violent.In the late evening, protesters and crowds of supporters and bystanders continued to gather in Mong Kok in Kowloon, jeering at rows of riot police. Cars drove by beeping in support, prompting cheers from the crowd, which began chanting “stand for freedom, stand with Hong Kong”.As the 1 October holiday approaches, Beijing has put extensive security measures in place. Authorities are keen not to let any incident mar the day, which will be marked by a massive military parade and a speech by Chinese president Xi Jinping.Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said she would formally withdraw a controversial extradition bill that triggered the protests in June. But over the course of protests and clashes, the demands of demonstrators have expanded to include an independent inquiry into police behaviour as well as implementing universal suffrage.Protesters say the city’s freedoms, including independent courts, press, and rule of law, have been eroded since the former British colony was handed over to Beijing in 1997, under an agreement that promised Hong Kong a “high degree of autonomy” for 50 years.Hong Kong has cancelled fireworks originally scheduled for the day, and the police appear to be cracking down harder, adding to the more than 1,400 people arrested since June. Last week, Amnesty International released a report based on interviews, showing a “disturbing pattern” of arbitrary arrests and “retaliatory violence”.Police said they had arrested two 13-year-olds at protests on Saturday, one of whom was accused of burning the Chinese flag. Offenders are liable to a fine and imprisonment for up to three years. Under Hong Kong law, offenders under the age of 14 cannot be sentenced to prison.Speaking at a reception for the 70th anniversary, Lam said her government would spare no effort in stopping the violence.",Hong Kong police and demonstrators clash as tensions escalate,2019-09-22/18:02:41,protesters and police have clashed in hong kong in another weekend of unrest as tensions escalate in the run up to a significant political anniversary for beijing riot police fired teargas pepper spray and bean bag rounds on protesters who vandalised metro stations and set improvised barricades ablaze in several flashpoints across the city the confrontations mark the th consecutive weekend of mass protest for the semi autonomous chinese territory and come less than  days before china celebrates its national day on  october the th anniversary of the founding of the people s republic of china earlier residents had staged a peaceful rally at the new town plaza in sha tin a key site of protests after police stormed the mall and clashed with protesters there in july demonstrators decorated the mall with origami paper cranes and hung banners from the railings a small group of musicians wearing masks played the song glory to hong kong which has become the anthem of the protests scenes at the mall turned ugly as protesters surrounded a man and accused him of being a spy from mainland china and punched and kicked him video footage showed the man walking away from the group bleeding from the head protesters at the mall trampled on the chinese flag and painted it black before dumping it into a river while crowds gathered outside the mall hurling bricks from an overpass at riot police who fired multiple rounds of teargas at them police also fired on demonstrators who gathered in the early evening in mong kok in kowloon a frequent site of clashes between police and protesters during the last three months the police said in a statement that radical protesters had thrown bricks at the local police station and set fires at road junctions endangering the safety of everyone at scene and seriously affecting traffic nearby elsewhere protesters unfurled a large banner with the words glory to hong kong and residents supportive of the protesters came out to the streets to heckle police in one incident a police officer charged at residents gathered in kawi fong in northern hong kong with his baton raised before a colleague pulled him back protesters vandalised metro stations smashing cctv cameras and spray painting ticket machines protesters have begun to target hong kong s mass transit railway after the operator was seen as bowing to government pressure to close stations during protests making it harder for demonstrators to escape or for others to join demonstrators have also been calling on the rail operator to release cctv footage of arrests made on  august at the prince edward station in kowloon believed to have turned violent in the late evening protesters and crowds of supporters and bystanders continued to gather in mong kok in kowloon jeering at rows of riot police cars drove by beeping in support prompting cheers from the crowd which began chanting stand for freedom stand with hong kong as the  october holiday approaches beijing has put extensive security measures in place authorities are keen not to let any incident mar the day which will be marked by a massive military parade and a speech by chinese president xi jinping hong kong s chief executive carrie lam said she would formally withdraw a controversial extradition bill that triggered the protests in june but over the course of protests and clashes the demands of demonstrators have expanded to include an independent inquiry into police behaviour as well as implementing universal suffrage protesters say the city s freedoms including independent courts press and rule of law have been eroded since the former british colony was handed over to beijing in  under an agreement that promised hong kong a high degree of autonomy for  years hong kong has cancelled fireworks originally scheduled for the day and the police appear to be cracking down harder adding to the more than   people arrested since june last week amnesty international released a report based on interviews showing a disturbing pattern of arbitrary arrests and retaliatory violence police said they had arrested two  year olds at protests on saturday one of whom was accused of burning the chinese flag offenders are liable to a fine and imprisonment for up to three years under hong kong law offenders under the age of  cannot be sentenced to prison speaking at a reception for the th anniversary lam said her government would spare no effort in stopping the violence ,Hong Kong Protests,0.382026255
"A peaceful rally at a metro station in Hong Kong descended into a clash between protesters and police as the city entered the 11th week of anti-government demonstrations.Hundreds of people took part in a sit-in at the out-of-town Yuen Long metro station earlier on Wednesday in protest at a violent and indiscriminate attack on commuters and protesters there a month ago.Dozens of men clad in white T-shirts rushed into the station late at night on 21 July and beat people both inside the station and on trains with canes and wooden sticks. Police were widely criticised for being absent during the attack.The rally on Wednesday night passed without incident for about three hours until shortly before 10pm local time (1500 BST), when dozens of protesters confronted riot police standing guard outside the station and nearby villages.Protesters shone laser pointers at about 100 riot police armed with shields and guns, before the officers started charging towards them. Demonstrators placed bins and plastic traffic barriers on the road as barricades but the police swiftly removed them. As the police charged, protesters shouted: “Triads! Triads!”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongDemonstrators then retreated to the metro station, pursued by large numbers of riot police. The police stopped outside the station as protesters used a fire hose to spray water and left oil and detergent on the floor in an apparent attempt to prevent the police from entering.Makeshift barricades were then set up by protesters inside the station using bins, magazine stands and other objects, while walls, ceilings and ticket machines were hit rhythmically with umbrellas and other items.At one point the atmosphere turned tense as police raised a blue flag to warn protesters that they were engaged in an illegal meeting and the officers could use force.The standoff continued for nearly an hour, with protesters throwing objects at the police including bottles, umbrellas and even yellow rubber ducks.The black-clad demonstrators squirted fire extinguishers to create smoke as they retreated. Many shouted slogans frequently used in the recent anti-extradition protests, including “reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our time!”. The police backed off shortly after 11pm and protesters began to leave.Police did not use teargas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds to disperse the crowds, which marks a departure from the usual pattern of tactics over the past two months.Resentment against police violence has grown in recent weeks after an increasing use of force to disperse protesters, with innocent bystanders and local residents also affected.Earlier on Wednesday evening, during a five-minute silence to mark the 21 July attack, some protesters covered one eye in a gesture of solidarity with a young woman whose eye was badly injured in one of the August protests.And at a press conference protesters wearing black T-shirts, hard hats and dark glasses, with scarves covering their faces, condemned police tactics. They also accused the government of condoning violent attacks by rural clans and gangsters. They noted that although dozens of attackers in Yuen Long had been arrested, none had been prosecuted so far.The wave of protests in Hong Kong, which started in early June to oppose a controversial extradition bill under which individuals could be sent to China for trial, has grown into a broader movement with five demands: the complete withdrawal of the now-suspended extradition bill; the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence; a halt to the characterisation of protests as “riots”; an amnesty for those arrested; and a resumption of political reform to allow

"Thousands of demonstrators in Hong Kong have paralysed traffic and shut down transport links between the city and the airport during another day of protests demanding democratic freedoms in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.On Sunday, demonstrators attempted to lay siege to the airport to draw global attention to the city that has been plunged into political crisis for the last three months.Travellers were stranded as an express train linking the airport to the city and several bus lines were suspended and roads were heavily congested. About two dozen flights were cancelled and more than 40 others delayed as staff and passengers struggled to reach the airport.The protest began in the afternoon when protesters dressed in black, with helmets and masks, some armed with plastic and metal poles, descended on the airport in Lantau island, blocking roads and forcing travellers to abandon their cars and drag their luggage the rest of the way toward the airport.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongAs hundreds of riot police arrived, they quickly retreated to a nearby town of Tung Chung, where they overtook a shopping complex and vandalised a metro station. Protesters smashed CCTV cameras and the windows of a control room, and flooded the station with water, setting off emergency sirens.Protesters scrawled on the walls: “Glory be to Hong Kong,” and “Black police” – the black being a reference to gangsters. One group lit a makeshift barricade on fire and another burned a Chinese flag, a gesture aimed at antagonising Beijing.“The government has not answered us, so we keep coming,” said Engred Lai, 18, a protester dressed head to toe in black and wearing a gas mask.Police condemned the demonstrators and said they had assaulted members of the public. “Their acts are barbaric and outrageous. The police will take resolute enforcement actions,” the force said.Sunday’s protests come less than a day after protesters and police clashed in running battles left 41 people in hospital as the city marks its 13th consecutive weekend of mass protests. The protests, triggered by a proposed bill to allow extradition to mainland China, have plunged Hong Kong into its worst political crisis in decades.As the protests, now a broader political movement demanding democracy for the former British colony under Chinese control since 1997, continue, authorities have ramped up their tactics.On Saturday, as helicopters hovered overhead, police fired rounds of teargas and water cannons at protesters, staining them with blue dye to mark them for arrest later. Undercover police were seen clashing with and arresting protesters.Protesters threw petrol bombs and bricks at police and set fire to a pyre across a road outside the police headquarters. Police also stormed several metro stations, arresting protesters. In one incident, officers stormed a train carriage, using batons to beat passengers and deploying pepper spray.Demonstrators on Sunday said they were not intimidated. “I’m not scared because many Hongkongers have already been caught. I know I’m not alone,” said Lui Cheung, 17, as he blocked a road outside the airport.In a press conference on Sunday, police said they had arrested 63 people during clashes on Saturday, including a 13-year-old boy who police said was carrying petrol bombs. More than 900 have been arrested since June, including pro-democracy lawmakers and prominent activists like Joshua Wong, a student leader in 2014 protests known as the umbrella movement.“Day by day this doesn’t feel like Hong Kong,” said Joey Cheung, a taxi driver who was trying to get to the airport. “If Hong Kong keeps going this way, who knows what will happen. Either a police or a protester, someone is going to get killed very soon.”By early evening on Sunday, protesters had scattered from Tung Chung, as some took ferries back to Hong Kong island and others crammed into public buses. Hundreds began walking a distance of eight miles (13km) to the nearest train station, while some escaped into cars waiting for them.Dozens of riot police arrived at Tung Chung after protesters had scattered where they were heckled by local residents calling them “black society”, a term for gangsters. The police have been accused of colluding with triad gangs and thugs to attack protesters, claims the police and government have vehemently denied.An elderly demonstrator wearing a vest that read “protect children” placed himself in front of the police with his hands up, trying to stop them from searching the area for protesters. The police searched passengers stranded at the station and reportedly made several arrests.Trains from the airport resumed partial service late in the evening.Beijing has reportedly barred the Hong Kong government, under its chief executive, Carrie Lam, from conceding to any of the protesters’ demands, which include the permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill as well as universal suffrage.Beijing has issued increasingly ominous warnings and the Chinese military has held several rounds of exercises across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzhen, but experts say a military intervention is still unlikely.“Beijing has now apparently decided that a military crackdown on Hong Kong’s civilian unrest would be too high stakes, and a police force that has gone insane would be their best tool,” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker.Observers believe the government is cracking down harder in hopes of ending the protests before China celebrates its national holiday on 1 October, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.The protesters say they will keep going. University and secondary students said they would begin a class boycott on Monday as other demonstrators called for a city-wide strike on Monday and Tuesday.“We love Hong Kong, we want to save Hong Kong people from the Chinese government,” said Markus Chan, 19, who was resting on a step outside the shopping complex in Tung Chung.“This movement will keep going. We will fight for it until they stop the bill.”",Hong Kong: riot police pursue pro-democracy protesters from airport,2019-09-01/12:32:26,thousands of demonstrators in hong kong have paralysed traffic

"Riot police have charged at hundreds of protesters in a busy downtown district in Hong Kong after some demonstrators had started a fire outside a police station.Earlier in the day, protests broke out in several areas of Hong Kong as security measures tightened at the airport in an attempt to stop protesters’ plans to paralyse the travel hub.The confrontations came as anti-government demonstrations, aimed at drawing global attention to the semi-autonomous Chinese city’s political crisis, came to the end of their 13th week.On Saturday night, the crowds chanted anti-police slogans and sang provocative songs outside the Mong Kok police station and shone laser beams at riot officers. They built make-shift barricades with roadside barriers and other objects, and as police threatened to fire rubber bullets and sponge rounds, some started a fire.“Reclaim Hong Kong! Revolution of the era!” many chanted. The fire was put out minutes later by the fire services.Riot police then began to charge at protesters, chasing them into surrounding streets. But many remained in the area and led the police in a game of cat and mouse. The police presence in the area remained heavy as of late Saturday. Some passersby verbally attacked protesters for causing disruptions.Mong Kok has become a hotspot for protests during the past week as emotions ran high after violent clashes took place last Saturday inside the Prince Edward station, in which police rushed in and brutally beat a number of protesters inside a train carriage. The police attack fuelled rumours of deaths and a large number of flowers have been left outside the entrance of the metro station.A small group tried to submit a petition to urge the MTR metro company to release CCTV footage of the police on Saturday afternoon at the station, shortly before staff announced its closure.A similar protest took place outside the Mong Kok police station late on Friday, prompting riot police to fire teargas and bean bag rounds as some had built barricades on streets and set fire to them.Hong Kong’s government said on Saturday that reports of people dying as a result of the police action were “false” and “malicious” rumours.Saturday’s demonstrations across Hong Kong were mostly aimed at voicing anger over the police’s use of force, which has escalated as tension reached boiling point during the past three months.Many protesters have insisted the Hong Kong government meet their political demands, including setting up an independent body to investigate the police’s alleged excessive use of force since the protests started in June.Earlier in the week, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, withdrew a controversial extradition bill, which originally ignited the protests. But protesters remain angry about alleged police brutality and have vowed to continue demonstrations.In a front-page editorial on Saturday, the overseas edition of the Communist party’s mouthpiece People’s Daily said “a small bunch of extremely violent elements have become the vanguards of foreign and anti-China forces” and were trying to “disrupt Hong Kong and paralyse the government to make it into an independent or semi-independent political entity”.Earlier in the day at the airport, riot police carrying helmets and shields patrolled areas in and around the venue and guarded its main entrances. Airport staff only admitted travellers with passports and boarding passes after a court injunction was issued earlier. A water cannon truck was spotted near the airport. Dozens of riot police also stopped airport-bound buses throughout the day, carrying out detailed searches of passengers’ luggage and checking their ID. They removed people they suspected of being protesters, some of whom were carrying gas masks and other protective gear.The airport express railway linking the airport to the city closed several stations, only operating services from the Hong Kong station terminus, where dozens of riot police were standing guard.Several bus services also suspended services to the airport, diverting to a neighbouring residential district, Tung Chung, and the airport car park was closed.Last Sunday, thousands of demonstrators paralysed traffic and shut down transport links between the city and the airport. Travellers were stranded as train and bus services were suspended and roads were heavily congested. Flights were cancelled and delayed.",Hong Kong riot police charge protesters at rally hotspot,2019-09-07/15:47:30,riot police have charged at hundreds of protesters in a busy downtown district in hong kong after some demonstrators had started a fire outside a police station earlier in the day protests broke out in several areas of hong kong as security measures tightened at the airport in an attempt to stop protesters plans to paralyse the travel hub the confrontations came as anti government demonstrations aimed at drawing global attention to the semi autonomous chinese city s political crisis came to the end of their th week on saturday night the crowds chanted anti police slogans and sang provocative songs outside the mong kok police station and shone laser beams at riot officers they built make shift barricades with roadside barriers and other objects and as police threatened to fire rubber bullets and sponge rounds some started a fire reclaim hong kong revolution of the era many chanted the fire was put out minutes later by the fire services riot police then began to charge at protesters chasing them into surrounding streets but many remained in the area and led the police in a game of cat and mouse the police presence in the area remained heavy as of late saturday some passersby verbally attacked protesters for causing disruptions mong kok has become a hotspot for protests during the past week as emotions ran high after violent clashes took place last saturday inside the prince edward station in which police rushed in and brutally beat a number of protesters inside a train carriage the police attack fuelled rumours of deaths and a large number of flowers have been left outside the entrance of the metro station a small group tried to submit a petition to urge the mtr metro company to release cctv footage of the police on saturday afternoon at the station shortly before staff announced its closure a similar protest took place outside the mong kok police station late on friday prompting riot police to fire teargas and bean bag rounds as some had built barricades on streets and set fire to them hong kong s government said on saturday that reports of people dying as a result of the police action were false and malicious rumours saturday s demonstrations across hong kong were mostly aimed at voicing anger over the police s use of force which has escalated as tension reached boiling point during the past three months many protesters have insisted the hong kong government meet their political demands including setting up an independent body to investigate the police s alleged excessive use of force since the protests started in june earlier in the week hong kong s leader carrie lam withdrew a controversial extradition bill which originally ignited the protests but protesters remain angry about alleged police brutality and have vowed to continue demonstrations in a front page editorial on saturday the overseas edition of the communist party s mouthpiece people s daily said a small bunch of extremely violent elements have become the vanguards of foreign and anti china forces and were trying to disrupt hong kong and paralyse the government to make it into an independent or semi independent political entity earlier in the day at the airport riot police carrying helmets and shields patrolled areas in and around the venue and guarded its main entrances airport staff only admitted travellers with passports and boarding passes after a court injunction was issued earlier a water cannon truck was spotted near the airport dozens of riot police also stopped airport bound buses throughout the day carrying out detailed searches of passengers luggage and checking their id they removed people they suspected of being protesters some of whom were carrying gas masks and other protective gear the airport express railway linking the airport to the city closed several stations only operating services from the hong kong station terminus where dozens of riot police were standing guard several bus services also suspended services to the airport diverting to a neighbouring residential district tung chung and the airport car park was closed last sunday thousands of demonstrators paralysed traffic and shut down transport links between the city and the airport travellers were stranded as train and bus services were suspended and roads were heavily congested flights were cancelled and delayed ,Hong Kong Protests,0.376387388
"Hong Kong has had its third consecutive day of mass protests as demonstrators and riot police firing teargas and rubber bullets clashed in several locations throughout the city.Tens of thousands of protesters, dressed in black and armed with umbrellas and hardhats, defied police orders to keep Sunday’s rally constrained to a park in central Hong Kong and fanned out across the city in the early evening. They streamed west and east, occupying main roads, setting up barricades, and chanting: “Reclaim Hong Kong!”As the city endured a tense calm on Monday, all eyes were on Beijing where it was expected that the Hong Kong and Macao affairs office – China’s highest level body on the former British colony – would be holding a press conference at 3pm local time (0700 GMT).It is believed to be the first time the unit has held a press briefing since Hong Kong was handed over to Beijing in 1997 and comes amid a flurry of condemnation of the protests from China’s state media.In the latest round of editorials, China Daily claimed that “external forces” and “outside meddling” were to blame for the unrest.It comes after the protesters again made Beijing’s representative office in Hong Kong a target for their anger on Sunday.Riot police blocked a contingent of demonstrators on their way to the building and as the crowd grew, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets. The protesters responded by throwing umbrellas, rocks, eggs, and gas canisters back at the police. The protesters created a drum beat using street signs and traffic barriers as they tried to hold their ground.“It lasted a whole minute. It was at least 10 rounds,” said Long, a 25-year-old medical volunteer who said he had helped pull demonstrators back from the frontline when they were stumbling and unable to see.Over the past three days, demonstrators have rallied to condemn an attack last weekend on commuters by suspected triad gangs, an incident that has led to accusations of government collusion, denied by Hong Kong officials.On Saturday, a peaceful march in the town of Yuen Long turned chaotic as police fired teargas, rubber bullets and sponge grenades, and charged protesters in a railway station. Thousands of demonstrators joined aviation workers at the airport for an 11-hour-sit-in on Friday.The former British colony is facing its most serious political crisis since it was returned to Chinese control in 1997. Under the terms of that agreement, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as: “One country, two systems.”Sunday’s protests marked the eighth consecutive weekend that Hongkongers have taken to the streets in protests that began over an extradition bill that would have allowed wanted suspects to be sent to mainland China.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office.

China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongAs the police fired continuous rounds of teargas into crowds on Sunday, some protesters fell to ground choking. One group sought refuge in a nearby apartment building when residents opened the gate, ushering them in. Demonstrators collapsed on the stairwell, some of them crying.“Even though the protesters are peaceful, they keep throwing the teargas. I don’t know why they keep throwing,” said Hinton, 16, who had tears in his eyes after being gassed.Police said they used teargas to disperse protesters who were hurling bricks at them but protesters insisted police fired first. “We are trying to protect our own freedom. We are doing this for this place, our place. I’ll be honest, I did throw things because I’m that angry,” said one protester, Angus, 24.The protesters were then pushed back to smaller roads in Sheung Wan, a normally busy neighbourhood turned into a ghost town after shops closed and residents were warned to stay inside. Tourists and residents ran from the scene, covering their eyes and mouths.Before midnight, the police had surrounded the protesters, shielding themselves with wooden boards and street signs. Teargas was lobbed at the protesters from all directions, shrouding the road and forcing the protesters to enter a mass transit station and leave.Some protesters said the police appeared to escalating their tactics, with officers firing on protesters earlier and more frequently. “I can’t even count how many rounds of teargas they used,” said Roy Chan, 39.In a statement, the government said protesters had pushed a cart of burning cardboard at police, “threatening the safety of police officers and members of public”. The government said it would “continue to give full support to police to strictly enforce the law to stop all violent behaviours”.Police said 49 people had been arrested in relation to Sunday’s protest, for suspected unlawful assembly and possession of offensive weapons.Organisers for Sunday’s event had originally planned to march from central Hong Kong to Sheung Wan to condemn the police for firing teargas and rubber bullets on protesters last weekend. The police did not grant a permit for the march – the second time authorities have rejected a protest request – following a ban on the Saturday rally in Yuen Long.Protesters fear authorities will adopt this line more in the future. On Sunday, one of the organisers of the Yuen Long rally, Max Chung, was arrested by police on suspicion of inciting an illegal assembly.Some say the situation risks spiralling out of control as the public doubts the Hong Kong government’s ability to govern and Beijing is likely to pressure Hong Kong authorities to take a harder line on protesters. As protesters continue to clash with police, people have only grown more frustrated, fuelling yet more demonstrations.“There’s a lot of public anger and I don’t think that’s going to go away soon,” said James Yip, 27, part of the group of protesters leaving Sheung Wan. “I think everyone is exhausted on both side, pro-government and pro-democracy.”Exhaustion among protests appears to have set in as well. Amy Yeung, 26, has been attending as many protests as she can. “I am mentally tired. Watching the news, you cry,” she said. “But at least standing here, we are giving the message that we are not alone.”On Sunday, protesters said they were more angry than exhausted and would continue. Jonathan, 19, who was resting on a curb away from the frontline in between rounds of teargas, said: “They see us as a threat because we are having an impact.”Residents have seen Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong grow in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent book sellers have disappeared from the city, to reappear in mainland China facing charges, a point critics of the extradition bill often make.“It seems to us that this is our last chance. If we don’t do this now, we won’t be able to later,” said Eunice Chan, 55, who grew up in Hong Kong before it was returned to Chinese control in 1997.",Police and protesters clash throughout Hong Kong

"Protesters have taken to the streets of Hong Kong for another round of mass anti-government demonstrations as political unrest continues to roil the city.Ahead of a city-wide strike and simultaneous protests in seven districts, on Sunday night protesters evaded and frustrated the police by holding flashmob demonstrations. Groups of protesters scattered, switching locations at the last minute and disappearing before riot police were able to arrive en masse.Protesters deviated from a previously planned rally in Hong Kong’s Western district, where police had prepared to defend China’s liaison office, a target in previous unrest.Demonstrators moved east to Causeway Bay, a major shopping district where they occupied main roads and disrupted traffic. Police fired several rounds of teargas on protesters there but many had already moved to other locations.In a park in Wan Chai, protesters defaced a statue of a golden bauhinia flower, a gift from China when Hong Kong was returned to Chinese control in 1997. The monument was spraypainted with the words: “Heaven will destroy the Communist party,” and “Liberate Hong Kong”.This is the ninth week of consecutive protests in Hong Kong, as the semi-autonomous city faces a political crisis that has deepened as authorities have tried to suppress it. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has disappeared from public view over the last two weeks.“I came to support Hong Kong. We are showing our guts to the government,” said Peter Tsang, 32, who attended the march in Tseung Kwan O. “A lot of people have come and they are stepping up because Carrie Lam has not come out of hiding.”In a statement released in the early hours of Monday, the Hong Kong government said “the deteriorating situation” showed protests were “spreading [and] pushing Hong Kong to the verge of a very dangerous situation.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongAs the protests wear on, demonstrators have begun shifting strategies while authorities arrest more people and deploy harsher tactics against them. Police have arrested more than 60 people and charged 44 of them with rioting, a crime that could mean up to 10 years in prison.“The protesters are trying to use up the energy of the police,” said Yan, 26, a protester in Causeway Bay. “We don’t want anyone to be arrested or hurt any more, so we didn’t stay in set places. We can be more flexible.”On Sunday, people blocked Hong Kong’s cross-harbour tunnel and another group of protesters surrounded a police station in the outer district of Kwun Tong, , where they shined lasers at the police and threw bricks at the compound. Earlier in the day, after a peaceful rally in Tseung Kwan O in Hong Kong’s New Territories, protesters broke the windows of a police station, using a makeshift catapult to launch objects at the building.The protests, which began over an extradition bill to send suspects to China, have turned into a broader political movement demanding accountability from the Hong Kong government, which ultimately answers to Beijing.The former British colony, which reverted to Chinese control in 1997, is meant to enjoy a “high degree” of autonomy from the mainland as part of the “one country, two systems” framework, but residents say their freedoms are slowly disappearing under China’s influence.The police have been criticised for what some say have been overly harsh tactics towards protesters, many of them students or recent graduates. In July, dozens of masked men dressed in white beat commuters with iron and wooden rods, shocking Hongkongers and eroding trust in the police, who did not stop the attack.Anger at the police and the Hong Kong government has spread from the protesters to the general public, as thousands of residents have joined weekend rallies and protests. Sunday’s protests marked the fourth day in a row of mass demonstrations.On Saturday, protesters clashed with police in several locations in Kowloon, as police fired teargas and pepper spray on crowds occupying main roads and areas outside police stations, following a peaceful march earlier in the day. Thousands of civil servants and medical staff rallied on Friday, while those from Hong Kong’s finance sector held a flashmob protest on Thursday.On Sunday, residents were handing out vouchers, food and supplies to protesters. On Saturday night and the early hours of Sunday, residents in a working-class district surrounded police, demanding the release of arrested protesters.“At the beginning, we were alone. No one understood us,” said one demonstrator who asked not to give his name, adding that more people have been donating protective gear and supplies to the protests. “More people are coming out, which is better and there is more support.” Protesters say police also appear to be changing their strategies, mostly keeping their distance and using teargas to disperse protesters instead of clashing directly with them. Others say the police appear to be waiting out the protesters, prolonging the standoffs and disruptions on the streets, perhaps in the hope of frustrating the general public.“They wait until we are exhausted and the protests become stretched out. They are trying to change public perception,” said one protester, 29-year-old William.Protesters believe that strategy will not work as smaller, dispersed protests like Sunday’s continue. “A little spark can catch fire, and it is spreading quickly,” added William.“It’s a long-term protest. Some people might think we are acting like rioters, but looking back at history there is no peaceful revolution,” said Yan.Some protesters stayed home, preparing for Monday’s mass strikes. Simultaneous rallies will take place in seven of Hong Kong’s 18 districts. Coffee shops and small businesses posted signs on their doors to say they would be closed on Monday. Workers from the transport sector have also pledged to stay home, potentially paralysing the city’s public transportation network.As tensions in Hong Kong escalate, observers have been watching for signs of Beijing intervening. Chinese officials have not ruled out the possibility of deploying the People’s Liberation Army, which has a garrison in Hong Kong.On Sunday, state media published several articles condemning protesters. An editorial in the state news agency Xinhua said: “The central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue.”",Hong Kong protesters use flashmob tactics to evade

"Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Hong Kong, as they sought to show their movement still had public support even after two months of increasingly violent clashes.Protesters, clad in their signature black and holding umbrellas, marched down major streets in Kowloon, chanting: “Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our time!” Volunteers handed out herbal tea and juice, while some shops that had closed for the day left boxes of drinks out for protesters.Three separate rallies took place on Saturday, marking the 11th weekend of protests in Hong Kong as residents continue to press the government to formally withdraw a controversial extradition bill as well as meet other demands.In one of the demonstrations, thousands of teachers braved heavy rains to fill a public square in central Hong Kong where they rallied against police brutality toward young protesters.“When I see how things are right now, I can’t see a future for the children,” said Li, 30, a kindergarten teacher who helped organise the rally. “Today the teachers came out to show students that we understand them and we will fight with them until the end,” she said of the event, called Protect the Next Generation. She said: “It’s not just the students. All Hong Kong people need protecting.”The weekend of demonstrations has served as a test for the momentum of the protests after tensions reached a new level this past week. Following a weekend of violent clashes with police, protesters swarmed Hong Kong’s airport. Demonstrators blocked passengers, forcing a shutdown, as well as clashing with police and detaining two men suspected of being spies in scenes pro-government figures and Chinese state media have seized on as evidence of the protesters’ violent tendencies.Following the violent episodes, protesters have called for a weekend of peaceful marches and a return to the methods used when the demonstrations began in June.On Saturday, the rallies were mostly peaceful as demonstrators appeared focused on Sunday’s demonstration in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park. Marching in Kowloon, they yelled: “See you at Victoria Park!”Many wore surgical masks but did not appear to be in full protective gear as they had been in past rallies in preparation for confrontations with the police. Riot police were deployed to meet dozens of protesters who had splintered off from the designated route of a march in Hung Hom in Kowloon and occupied roads, but skirmishes were limited.One group surrounded a police station in Mong Kok and threw eggs at the building until riot police charged at the group, dispersing them. Others vandalised the offices of a pro-Beijing political party. One group left pineapples, meant to symbolise grenades, at the door of a pro-government organisation, the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, which played a key role in anti-colonial government riots in 1967, when homemade bombs were planted at street corners around the city. Critics said officials seemed intent on clashing with protesters. The police have banned the original plan for Sunday’s event, a march, and have instead confined it to a rally within Victoria Park. The park can hold about 100,000 people but organisers expect many more. Rally-goers on nearby roads or other overflow areas can be charged with unlawful assembly, which can lead to a maximum of five years in prison.“We know the government is not trying to help the situation or at least not showing any signs of trying,” said Elizabeth Yu, 26, a musician and performer.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office.

Participants dressed in white, to show their contrast with the protesters, sang the national anthem and chanted: “Oppose violence! Save Hong Kong!”As the protests enter their third month, there has been no sign of concessions from the government, and Beijing has issued increasingly severe warnings. Analysts said authorities were hoping the protests would diminish on their own after students return to school in September.But on Friday secondary school students pledged to boycott classes one day a week when term begins, and university students are expected to launch similar campaigns. Nonetheless, observers suggested it is likely that the momentum of protests will decrease..“Even if the movement gradually dies down from this point on it has long-lasting impacts. Many people gained a kind of political consciousness. This is not something you can erase instantaneously,” said Wong, an academic focusing on social movements in Hong Kong, who prefers not to give his full name. “Probably you won’t see the same frequency and intensity but that doesn’t mean it’s over.

"A peaceful march in the town of Yuen Long to condemn an attack by suspected gang members on commuters turned violent as Hong Kong riot police fired teargas and rubber bullets on the crowd and used batons to beat protesters.On Sunday, the government said 11 men had been arrested, aged between 18 and 68, for unlawful assembly, possession of an offensive weapon and assaulting a police officer. “Police condemn the deliberate attacks by violent protestors and will investigate all illegal and violent acts,” the government said in a statement.Organisers said almost 300,000 protesters and residents on Saturday afternoon defied a police ban to descend on the town in Hong Kong’s western New Territories. They marched to the mass transit station where masked men in white T-shirts had chased and beaten passengers the previous Sunday, leaving 45 hospitalised.By evening, the march had turned tense as demonstrators pushed close to villages surrounding the town, where some of the triads believed to be behind the attack are based. Police shouted warnings through loudspeakers telling protesters they were involved in an illegal gathering and should leave immediately.After hours of standoffs near two of the villages and in various locations throughout the town, police began dispersing the crowd, firing rubber bullets, sponge grenades, and teargas, in some cases near residential areas. The police were also seen firing tear gas and rubber bullets at journalists. The protesters – many of whom were wearing black T-shirts and hard hats and were armed with shields made from boards of wood and surfboards, as well as hiking sticks and rods – retaliated by throwing umbrellas and water bottles. Others hurled rocks and bottles at the police. Demonstrators dismantled roadside barriers and built makeshift barricades between them and the police.Police senior superintendent Yolanda Liu said in a late night press briefing that protesters had thrown bricks, bottles with corrosive liquid, and smoke bombs at police. Most demonstrators left by about 7pm as news spread that police had deployed a special tactical squad to clear the streets and protesters saw reinforcements arriving, hemming them in.Hundreds of protesters remained, however, and continued to face off with the police late into the night, regrouping in the Yuen Long train station and along the main road.In one episode that protesters and critics have begun comparing to the attack on passengers in Yuen Long last week, a special tactical unit rushed into the train station where protesters had gathered, some getting ready to go home. The police fired pepper spray on them, while beating some with batons.“The police rushed in without any warning. They were hitting and hitting, they were beating protesters and regular people continuously for at least 20 seconds,” said Mathew Lam, 18, who said he had seen five people injured.Protesters tried to use a fire extinguisher to push back the police. At least one protester was pushed to the ground, bleeding. Blood smears could be seen on the floor in the station lobby.“It was terrible … it was the same as what happened last week in Yuen Long station,” said Stephy Chan, 19, who was in the station at the time. “Last week it was the men in white. This time it was the police,” she said.Hong Kong’s hospital authority said 17 people had been hospitalised following the clashes, including two who were in serious condition.Earlier, a group of protesters had smashed the windows of a Lexus near the train station after spotting rods similar to those used against passengers last Sunday, leaving fliers criticising the police on the bonnet.The Hong Kong government said in a statement in the early hours of Sunday that protesters had also vandalised police cars and had blocked roads. The government said it “strongly condemned the protesters for breaching the public peace and breaking the law deliberately”.“The police will take serious follow-up actions with those violent protesters,” it said.The police also issued a statement on Saturday reminding protesters that they were participating in an “unauthorised assembly” and could be punished with up to five years in prison. Amnesty International condemned the police’s response to protesters. Man-kei Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said: “There were repeated instances today where police officers were the aggressors; beating retreating protesters, attacking civilians in the train station and targeting journalists.”He added: “Such a heavy-handed response now appears the modus operandi for Hong Kong police and we urge them to quickly change course.”Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region of China, is facing its worst political crisis in decades. The protests, which began over a controversial extradition bill, have evolved to take in other demands, including a police inquiry into the violence in Yuen Long last week.Residents, activists and opposition lawmakers have accused the government and police of colluding with the triads in an attempt to suppress protests, a charge vehemently denied by Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam.Those attending the rally on Saturday said they were not there to make political demands, but to speak out against violence. Protesters surrounded the police headquarters chanting: “Black police” – a reference to the triads, known in Chinese as “black societies”.“It’s not so much about democracy as it is about trust,” said Fong, 30. “If every Hongkonger chooses to stay at home, then we will surely die … This is the way Hongkongers show their trust to each other – by showing up and standing up for each other.”Anger over last week’s Yuen Long attack has added fuel to Hong Kong’s protest movement, with additional rallies planned for Sunday. On Friday, thousands of protesters staged an 11-hour sit-in at the Hong Kong airport. Observers say escalated tensions raise the likelihood that Beijing will push the Hong Kong government to take a harder line on the protesters. In a rare move, police denied the demonstrators’ application for the rally on Saturday in Yuen Long.Authorities also rejected a request to hold one on Sunday in Sheung Wan, near where police fired teargas and rubber bullets on demonstrators who had defaced China’s representative office in Hong Kong last week.Protesters have vowed to continue. Max Chung, who helped organise the rally on Saturday, said he believed residents had shown their resolve: “Hongkongers have stiffened their backs to say no to authoritarianism.”",Hong Kong: police

"A major anti-government march in Hong Kong descended into chaos late on Sunday, as police fired teargas on protesters and unidentified masked men attacked commuters returning from the demonstration.The protesters had surrounded China’s liaison office in the city, where they barricaded the building’s entrance and wrote graffiti its walls.In running battles between riot police and protesters, police fired successive rounds of teargas and advanced on demonstrators who retaliated by throwing back canisters of gas and glass bottles in attempts to hold their ground. After police fired rubber bullets, the crowd eventually dispersed.In a train station in Yuen Long, in an outer district of Hong Kong, dozens of men, some masked, beat passengers with wooden sticks.Photos of pro-democracy lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, one of those attacked, showed him bleeding in the face. A female journalist who was filming the attack also appeared to have been beaten. Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK reported that a pool of blood was left in the station lobby.Protesters voiced anger at the delayed response by authorities to the situation in Yuen Long, with 10 police deployed to the area after the attackers had left.The Hong Kong government condemned the violence in a statement, confirming that “some people” had attacked commuters on the station platform and within train compartments. “It led to confrontations and injuries. The [government] strongly condemns any violence and will seriously take enforcement actions.”The government also “strongly” condemned violent acts by the protesters themselves. “These outrageous, violent acts included hurling petrol bombs, setting fires and throwing bricks … This is absolutely unacceptable to Hong Kong,” the statement said. “These outrageous, violent acts included hurling petrol bombs, setting fires and throwing bricks.”The latest round of violence is likely to fuel further unrest in the city, where public outcry over an extradition bill has evolved into a broader protest movement against the city’s disappearing autonomy under Chinese control.“The situation is getting worse because every time there is a protest, there is also a clash with police and every time there is a clash it gives people even more reason to come back out,” said Victoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at Notre Dame University in the US, who follows Hong Kong politics.More than 400,000 people had taken to the streets on Sunday afternoon, in the latest outpouring of anger at the local government over a controversial extradition bill, violent police tactics on protesters, and other grievances.Earlier on, elderly protesters holding flowers as a sign of peace pledged to stay until the younger protesters had left. Their aim was to give the flowers to the police, in hope of convincing them not to act against the crowd.Along the route, protesters stopped by the police headquarters and stuck colourful Post-It notes with messages condemning police violence on the barricades. “Nasty police, shame on you!” many shouted. “Hong Kong police know the law but break the law.” The crowds booed and gestured when police officers appeared on a balcony.Thousands of demonstrators had defied the police-sanctioned route ending in a business district in central Hong Kong, and pushed westwards to Beijing’s representative office, while others occupied areas of central Hong Kong.Facing off against police, protesters beat street signs and their helmets, responding to riot police who were beating their riot shields with batons. Plastic street barriers, traffic cones, and a ladder were set on fire near the protesters, while anti-police graffiti was scrawled in an underpass.Protesters chanted “reclaim Hong Kong, a revolution in our time” – using the campaign slogan of a Hong Kong independence activist.The demonstrations on Sunday were the seventh consecutive weekend when citizens have come out against the government. The protests, which began over the now-suspended bill, have grown into a wider democracy movement in the Chinese territory.The protests pose the most direct challenge to Beijing’s authority over the former British colony since its return to Chinese control in 1997. As part of the deal, Hong Kong was meant to maintain a high degree of autonomy from the mainland, with an independent judiciary and a free press, under a framework known as one country, two systems.But over the years, residents have witnessed their government jail activists, disqualify elected pro-democracy lawmakers, and construct expensive infrastructure physically linking Hong Kong more closely to the mainland. Chinese security agents are also believed to have abducted independent booksellers in the territory.In response to mass demonstrations and clashes that began in early June, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, promised the extradition bill was dead. But protesters, worried Beijing would use the bill to extradite activists and political enemies to China, are not satisfied.Protesters are calling for a formal withdrawal of the bill, as well as an investigation into alleged police brutality against unarmed protesters in previous rallies.“The government hasn’t responded, so we just need to keep coming out,” said Catherine Sin, 21, a recent graduate who said this was the fourth protest she had attended in the past month.Demonstrators doubt Lam’s promises. She has avoided using the term chit wui, or “withdraw” and instead described the bill as “having died a natural death”. Lam has said the bill will expire at the end of the legislative session that finishes next July, but protesters do not trust her to keep her word.“That’s why we are so angry and still insist on being out here,” said Lucia Kwok, 56, who said she was attending the protests in hopes of protecting young protesters from the police.Protesters believe the movement will continue as long as the government does not respond. Joshua Wong, a former leader of pro-democracy protests that swept the city in 2014, said: “So long as Carrie Lam doesn’t terminate the extradition bill and continues to push police to the frontline, the political crisis will continue.”While protesters have vowed to continue until Lam meets their demands, some said they fear the movement will lose steam as demonstrations fail to produce meaningful results from the government. Residents who initially supported the movement are now worried it has turned too violent.“I worry about the youth getting hurt. After all, they are the future of this city,” said Jimmy Sheng, 40, who runs a hotel near where police dispersed protesters.“There is no end. In the short term I’m not optimistic, but we are doing our best. Without actual change of regime in Beijing, nothing will improve,” said Gordon Poon, a demonstrator and political commentator.",Hong Kong police fire rubber bullets as protests turn

"Thousands of students in Hong Kong have boycotted the first day of the new term in a fresh wave of protests, after a tense weekend of violent clashes between police and demonstrators.On Monday, university and secondary students marked the end of their summer break by skipping classes and holding rallies to call on the government to withdraw a controversial extradition bill, among other demands.Thousands of students wearing helmets, goggles and masks – the unofficial uniform of the protests – filled the grounds of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), holding black banners saying, “Boycott for freedom” and periodically shouting, “Reclaim Hong Kong”.“If you are not a slave, don’t act like one,” said one speaker, a woman introduced only by her surname Chiu, from an alumni group, who urged students to continue to fight for their freedoms. A stage behind her featured part of a saying by Mao Zedong: “A single spark can start a prairie fire.”“We should not give up, whatever happens,” said Brian Cheung, 16, who has been protesting throughout the summer and came out to support the boycott.In a park across the city, outside of the government’s headquarters, hundreds of people gathered in solidarity with students for a workers’ rally. Demonstrators have also called for a city-wide strike on Monday and Tuesday.For the past 13 weeks, anti-extradition demonstrations have pitted Hong Kong protesters against the Beijing-backed semi-autonomous city’s authorities.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongTensions were running high after a weekend of some of the worst confrontations of the protests. After running battles on Saturday, in which protesters threw petrol bombs and lit fires, police targeted protesters and commuters in metro stations, beating them with batons. On Sunday, protesters paralysed transport links to Hong Kong airport.At CUHK, a young man stood on the stage and tore apart a protest banner. Waving a mainland Chinese passport, he yelled at the crowd: “You don’t deserve to be university students!” Riot police patrolled stations of the city’s mass transit railway network as protesters blocked train doors from closing, causing delays and throwing morning rush hour into chaos. Police were seen arresting at least one group of protesters as well as searching people on the street. While university students called for a two-week boycott, secondary students have vowed to protest for one day a week until demonstrators’ demands are met. Organisers estimated at least 9,000 secondary students from more than 200 schools would be participating in the boycott.On Monday morning, secondary students kneeled, held hands, and chanted in the rain outside their schools amid a typhoon warning that had closed many primary schools.In Kowloon, dozens of students and alumni stood outside the Ying Wa College for Boys, chanting: “Free Hong Kong! Democracy Now!” Some had painted one side of their goggles red, in reference to a woman who was reportedly blinded in one eye while protesting. One held a sign with the Bible verse: “Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”“We are willing to give up our dignity just to beg the society to change,” said Thomas Loh, 17, one of the students who helped organise the boycott at his school. Loh said they planned to continue their boycott on Tuesday, with issues such as press freedom and how students felt about the protests on the agenda.As the protests continue, the authorities appear to be cracking down harder, with more than 1,000 people arrested since the demonstrations began in June. In a press conference on Monday, police said they arrested 159 people over the weekend, including a 13-year-old boy found with two petrol bombs.On Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said in a regular news briefing that demonstrations in Hong Kong had “completely exceeded the scope of freedom of assembly”. “They have evolved into extreme and violent actions,” he said, reiterating Beijing’s support for the Hong Kong government and police.In an English language editorial on Sunday, the Xinhua state news agency said “the end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonise China”.The pro-democracy movement scored a rare win on Monday when a court overturned an order barring Agnes Chow, an activist and former student leader in the 2014 pro-democracy protests, from running for a seat in Hong Kong’s legislature.Chow was among a group of prominent democracy figures, including another former student leader Joshua Wong, arrested on Friday.The shift of the protests to school campuses comes as Chinese officials blame the movement on the city’s liberal education curriculum.In recent weeks, Beijing has criticised teachers and parents for not instilling patriotic values in students and called for an overhaul of Hong Kong’s education system, which includes topicssuch as the Chinese military’s violent crackdown on democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.Secondary students were preparing to hold “civic lessons” to educate their younger peers. Students said they would soon escalate their actions if the government continued to refuse protesters’ demands, which include the formal withdrawal of the bill and making democratic reforms.“For now, we are still boycotting under the school but escalation means not only do we boycott … we have to paralyse the teaching institutions,” said Kinson Cheung, 18, a university student who had come to support the secondary students at Ying Wa.At the gates to the school, teachers watched as students handed out permission slips for parents to sign allowing the students to skip lessons. Others schools have reportedly banned their students from attending the boycott.Loh said: “I was once a so-called ‘Hong Kong pig’, someone who only wants to live peacefully and cares more about the economy than politics, but now I realise how important this home and the freedom I enjoy here is to me.” He added: “I really hope Hong Kong can once again be a free city.”",Hong Kong students boycott

"Police and demonstrators have clashed after hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday in the city’s largest demonstration in recent weeks.Riot police armed with batons and shields fired teargas to disperse the crowd as protesters ran toward officers who tried to push them back from a main road in the western district near Beijing’s liaison office with the city. One demonstrator threw a bottle at police. Officers advanced on the crowd, setting off smoke bombs.Smoke filled the air after several rounds of teargas were fired. Hundreds of protesters ran away in panic.The clashes came after demonstrators defied police orders to restrict the boundaries of their rally, in a new and bold display of support for a political movement that shows few signs of slowing.Protesters ran toward police, with one throwing a bottle and police have now advanced on them and set off what looks like tear gas. pic.twitter.com/EnJpi6ywD8Protesters ignored police demands to end the march before reaching the heart of the business district in central Hong Kong and continued marching on to the Beijing liaison office.They graffitied the walls of the building and called for a “revolution of the century”. “The Chinese Communist party brings chaos to Hong Kong,” another said. Protesters set up barricades with metal fences and threw eggs before calling on the crowd to retreat as vans of riot police took up positions near them.Elderly protesters holding flowers as a sign of peace pledged to stay until the younger protesters had left. Other demonstrators set up barricades with dismantled metal fences.Organisers estimated that about 430,000 people had attended the march on Sunday, which marks the seventh consecutive weekend when citizens have come out against the government. The protests, which began over the now-suspended bill, have grown into a wider democracy movement in the Chinese territory. Protesters are also calling for an investigation into alleged police brutality against unarmed protesters in previous rallies.“The government hasn’t responded, so we just need to keep coming out,” said Catherine Sin, 21, a recent graduate who said this was the fourth protest she had attended in the last month.Volunteers instructed protesters to put on face masks to avoid detection by police while others carried water, umbrellas and other supplies.Demonstrators created a sea of black, the official colour of the protest movement, punctuated by umbrellas giving shade from the sun. They chanted their demands, focused mainly on calls for an inquiry into police tactics and dropping prosecutions against arrested protesters, shouting “investigate suppression” and “withdraw the prosecution”. Some held photos of injured protesters and signs saying: “Stop police brutality.”Amid the main march, hundreds made a detour to congregate outside the police headquarters, which has twice before been the scene of noisy rallies in which protesters vandalised the outside of the building. On Sunday, the HQ was surrounded by giant water-filled barricades set up by the authorities. Riot police in green uniforms holding long shields were standing guard behind the barricades at one point.Protesters stuck colourful sticky notes with messages condemning police violence on the barricades. “Nasty police, shame on you!” many shouted. “Hong Kong police know the law but break the law.” The crowds booed and gestured when police officers appeared on a balcony.“For freedom and dignity, we need to pay a price. I don’t advocate violence but to be effective in getting what we want, bloodshed is sometimes inevitable. It’s a sad reality,” said one protester, who gave his name as Raymond, when asked if he expected the march to result in renewed clashes between police and protesters.Earlier, there were cheers as protesters streamed out of Hong Kong’s Victoria Park, heading towards the city centre. Demonstrators called “Go Hong Kong!” and held signs that said “No extradition to China” – in reference to the controversial extradition bill that has caused the city’s largest political crisis in decades.In response to mass demonstrations and clashes that began in early June, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, promised the extradition bill was “dead”. Protesters worried Beijing would use the bill to extradite activists and political enemies to China.Activists have vowed to continue until Lam meets key demands, including the permanent withdrawal of the bill, and democratic reforms to establish direct elections. They also want her to resign.“She keeps making things worse,” said Gordon Poon, who joined the march.Sunday’s protest was quieter than past demonstrations, some said, but activists were still happy with the turnout. Three hours after the march began crowds were still making their way from the demonstration’s starting point.“People still came out. We still have to do something,” said Crystal Wong, 34, a therapist. Others said they were prepared to come out every weekend or several times a month. So, a social worker who asked to give only her surname, said: “I think it’s becoming more long-lasting. We are ready for a long fight.”Before the march began, some demonstrators shouted at police officers, condemning them for beating protesters in past demonstrations. One young man used rolled up paper to repeatedly beat a poster with a photograph of the police commissioner. Bags of rubbish and newspaper were thrown out of a nearby window at the crowd, which drew boos in response. Police built water barriers around their headquarters and set a security cordon around the government complex. Metal fences, rubbish bins and other street materials, which demonstrators have dismantled and used to make barricades for past protests, have been removed. Workers have glued bricks to the ground to stop them being used as weapons.The police have warned of possible violence. Authorities said on Saturday they discovered 2kg of powerful homemade explosives, triacetone triperoxide (TATP), and petrol bombs, acid, knives and metal rods on the premises, as well as anti-extradition bill banners.The route of Sunday’s march was originally meant to end at Hong Kong’s high court in the city centre to underline another demand – for a judge-led commission to investigate police use of rubber bullets, teargas and truncheons on unarmed protesters over the past few weeks. Instead, police have ordered the rally organiser, Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), to conclude the march at an earlier point on the route, before reaching the city centre, which is close to the government complex. Local public broadcaster RTHK reported that protesters were defying police orders and marching toward the government headquarters in Admiralty.In an English-language editorial on Sunday, China’s state-run Global Times said: “China will not allow extremists and external forces to take down Hong Kong’s legal system and drive the city into a vicious cycle. If Hong Kong loses its rule of law and becomes a political battleground, it will have an uncertain future. That is against the wishes of Hong Kong residents, and China will not allow it to happen.”The protests pose the most direct challenge to Beijing’s authority over the former British colony since its return to Chinese control in 1997. As part of the deal, Hong Kong was meant to maintain a high degree of autonomy from the mainland, with an independent judiciary and a free press, under a framework known as one country, two systems.But over the years, the city has witnessed the growing influence of Beijing. Independent booksellers have disappeared, the government has disqualified pro-democracy politicians and jailed pro-democracy activists.Bonnie Leung Wing-man, the vice convener of CHRF, said she expected as many to turn out as in a recent march on 1 July, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover, when half a million people attended. More than 1 million people attended previous marches.“As Carrie Lam’s government didn’t show real actions or sincerity to respond to our … demands, and police abuse of power has continued, we expect a large turnout,” she said.The protests have settled into a pattern in which peaceful demonstrations sanctioned by the city turn violent when police clash with those who refuse to leave. Police have warned demonstrators to leave immediately when the demonstration ends on Sunday, one minute before midnight.On Saturday, pro-Beijing groups organised a rival rally pledging support for the police and calling for an end to the unrest. In China, the protests have been described as riots, with state-media focusing on demonstrators’ clashes with police. Images of the protests have been censored on the messaging platform WeChat.A group of demonstrators released a video of protesters, hunger strikers and others reading aloud a manifesto for the movement. Some faced the camera while others showed only their backs. Two women, said to be parents of protesters, said: “We do not have arms, we are not violent. All we have are hearts that yearn for justice and a fearless … determination to go on.”While protesters have vowed to continue until Lam meets their demands, some say they fear the movement will lose steam as demonstrations fail to produce meaningful results from the government. “There is no end. In the short term I’m not optimistic, but we are doing our best. Without actual change of regime in Beijing, nothing will improve,” said Poon.",Police and protesters clash amid huge democracy march in Hong Kong,2019-07-21/15:59:00,police and demonstrators have

"Violent clashes have erupted between Hong Kong police and protesters at the end of a peaceful demonstration against the controversial extradition bill. The incidents took place late on Sunday in a bustling town between Hong Kong island and the border with China.The scene descended into chaos shortly before 10pm local time (1400 GMT), after riot police chased protesters into a shopping centre in Sha Tin. Police used truncheons and pepper spray against protesters, who threw objects such as umbrellas and plastic water bottles at them. Some protesters were also seen beating a police officer. Several arrests were made.A sanctioned, daytime demonstration against the bill earlier in the day had drawn tens of thousands of people. The extradition bill’s critics fear it could result in government opponents being sent to China to stand trial in Communist party-controlled courts.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongThe violence broke out shortly after police had cleared the streets following an hours-long standoff with protesters that began in the late afternoon when a small group of protesters threw objects at the police and placed traffic cones on the street, dismantled roadside metal barriers and set up makeshift barricades to separate themselves from police, who formed into a line.Those standing near the police line put on goggles, face masks and helmets and armed themselves with umbrellas in case police used pepper spray. Noisy protesters chanted: “Nasty police, shame on you!” and shouted “Hong Kong, go!” to boost their spirits.At about 6.30pm, more than a hundred riot police in green uniforms emerged on the scene, holding long shields. Protesters shouted: “Warrant cards! Warrant cards!” – complaining that police did not have identification numbers on their uniforms.In a statement late on Sunday, the Hong Kong government said it “strongly condemned” protesters who “blocked roads, violently assaulted police officers and caused a breach of peace.”.On Saturday, police had used pepper spray and batons to clear protesters in a similar protest in Sheung Shui, on the Chinese border, after clashes with protesters who refused to leave after a police-sanctioned march.Police commissioner Stephen Lo said in a press briefing early on Monday that more than 40 protesterswere arrested. He said at least 10 policemen were injured, including one who had a section of his ring finger bitten off by a protester. He also said protesters violently kicked and beat a policeman who fell to the ground in the shopping centre in Shatin when the clashes took place.The public broadcaster RTHK later said that 22 people were admitted to hospital after the clashes, of whom three were in serious condition. It reported that 11 police officers were injured in the unrest and two lost fingers.The extradition bill has been suspended and Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has declared it “dead”, but this has failed to reassure citizens, who fear it could be revived. At the demonstration in Sha Tin earlier on Sunday, protesters also urged the authorities to release people who have been detained during protests over the past month, and to investigate police use of force.“Release the righteous fighters! Carrie Lam step down! Shame on the nasty police!” they chanted.Since 9 June, Hong Kong has been rocked by its biggest political crisis, with millions thronging the streets under the sweltering sun to protest against the proposed extradition law, which many fear could result in government critics being sent to China to stand trial.The anti-extradition movement has morphed into a bigger movement encompassing a range of different causes over the past weeks. Many Hong Kong citizens say they have felt energised and emboldened by the solidarity and large turnout at recent protests, which have made headlines across the world.The extradition protests have also reignited a longing for democracy. On Sunday, many protesters also chanted “I want real universal suffrage!”Hong Kong’s leader is not elected by ordinary voters but by an elite committee accountable to Beijing. Only half of the 70-seat legislature is directly elected, while the other 35 seats are occupied by mostly pro-establishment figures from corporate and special interest groups.The Hong Kong government has ejected pro-democracy lawmakers and barred candidates seen as pro-independence from running for elections, thereby stripping the pro-democracy camp’s ability to block unpopular policies in the legislature.",Hong Kong protest ends in chaotic clashes between police and demonstrators,2019-07-15/03:04:43,violent clashes have erupted between hong kong police and protesters at the end of a

"Hong Kong riot police have fired rounds of teargas, rubber bullets, pepper balls and sponge rounds, and beaten people, as protesters led them on a game of cat-and-mouse across the city. The actions took place after a peaceful afternoon march into a confrontation and split into several impromptu marches in different locations.Tens of thousands of demonstrators took part in an anti-government rally in the Kwun Tong district in Kowloon on Saturday, marking the city’s 12th week of protests. The peaceful march, sanctioned by police, turned into a tense standoff between riot police and protesters by mid-afternoon after demonstrators built barricades with bamboo rods and plastic traffic barriers outside a police station.At about 4.40pm local time, baton-wielding riot police charged at thousands of protesters, beating them as they fled. Protesters threw bamboo rods and other objects back at the police.At one point, objects on the ground were on fire as police chased demonstrators along the streets and into nearby buildings.“Protesters are simply not able to defend themselves. Police are abusing their powers,” said a man watching the scene.The street was empty after the clearing operation which lasted about 15 minutes. But protesters retreated to other locations and by early evening, amid more confrontations on a side street and at a nearby residential complex, protesters threw rocks and placed soap and oil on the ground. Police fired several more rounds of teargas and rubber bullets, pepper balls and sponge rounds in return.After police cleared the streets in Kwun Tong around 8pm, protesters moved to another district, Wong Tai Sin, and occupied the main road. They shone laser pointers at a police residential quarters in the area and police fired more rounds of teargas. Police officers charged at the crowds occupying the main road, bringing traffic to a standstill, and subdued several protesters.By late night, some protesters moved to another area, Sham Shui Po. They set up makeshift barricades with rubbish bins and other objects on a street near the local police station and shone laser pointers into the station. Riot police descended into the area and charged at protesters and removed the road blocks. As of 11pm, protesters and riot police were still locked in a standoff.Many demonstrators covered their faces with medical masks and wore balaclava-style scarves and dark glasses covered with tinfoil.The key theme of the sanctioned march earlier in the afternoon was to oppose the government’s installation of smart lamp-posts equipped with sensors, closed-circuit cameras and data networks. The government said the lamp-posts would only collect air quality, traffic and weather data, although many at the protests said they had covered themselves because of privacy concerns.Some handed out medical masks while others gave out tinfoil to cover phones, credit cards with smart pay functions and smart identity cards that Hongkongers are mandated to carry.“We feel unsafe, that’s why we have to speak up,” said Harry Yip, who said he was wearing a hat, reflective dark glasses and a black scarf over his face to avoid government surveillance.The fear of surveillance comes amid reports that many Hong Kong residents have been interrogated upon entering mainland China, being taken into rooms to have their messages and photos on their phones and computers checked. A member of the British consulate in Hong Kong, Simon Cheng, was released on Saturday after being detained in China for 15 days while there on business.More broadly, the city’s demonstrations are aimed at pressurising the Hong Kong government into responding to protesters’ political demands, including the complete withdrawal of the now suspended extradition bill – under which individuals can be sent to China for trial – the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence, and the free election of Hong Kong’s leaders and legislature.Many protesters resented a decision by Hong Kong’s metro company, MTR, on Saturday to stop operating trains along a large stretch of a line from 12pm in an apparent move to stop protesters from reaching the protest in Kwun Tong.Resentment against the government and police has reached a dangerous level among the population after numerous violent confrontations between the police and protesters erupted during 11 weeks of protests in Hong Kong, a regional financial hub once known as one of the world’s safest cities, in the past two-and-a-half months.A Hong Kong government statement issued close to midnight on Saturday “strongly condemns” protesters for paralysing traffic, hurling suspected petrol bombs and bricks at police, setting fires and vandalising public property, including smart lamp-posts. It said the government would hold them liable for illegal acts.",Hong Kong riot police beat protesters at anti-surveillance rally,2019-08-24/17:41:30,hong kong riot police have fired rounds of teargas rubber bullets pepper balls and sponge rounds and beaten people as protesters led them on a game of cat and mouse across the city the actions took place after a peaceful afternoon march into a confrontation and split into several impromptu marches in different locations tens of thousands of demonstrators took part in an anti government rally in the kwun tong district in kowloon on saturday marking the city s th week of protests the peaceful march sanctioned by police turned into a tense standoff between riot police and protesters by mid afternoon after demonstrators built barricades with bamboo rods and plastic traffic barriers outside a police station at about  pm local time baton wielding riot police charged at thousands of protesters beating them as they fled protesters threw bamboo rods and other objects back at the police at one point objects on the ground were on fire as police chased demonstrators along the streets and into nearby buildings protesters are simply not able to defend themselves police are abusing their powers said a man watching the scene the street was empty after the clearing operation which lasted about  minutes but protesters retreated to other locations and by early evening amid more confrontations on a side street and at a nearby residential complex protesters threw rocks and placed soap and oil on the ground police fired several more rounds of teargas and rubber bullets pepper balls and sponge rounds in return after police cleared the streets in kwun tong around pm protesters moved to another district wong tai sin and occupied the main road they shone laser pointers at a police residential quarters in the area and police fired more rounds of teargas police officers charged at the crowds occupying the main road bringing traffic to a standstill and subdued several protesters by late night some protesters moved to another area sham shui po they set up makeshift barricades with rubbish bins and other objects on a street near the local police station and shone laser pointers into the station riot police descended into the area and charged at protesters and removed the road blocks as of pm protesters and riot police were still locked in a standoff many demonstrators covered their faces with medical masks and wore balaclava style scarves and dark glasses covered with tinfoil the key theme of the sanctioned march earlier in the afternoon was to oppose the government s installation of smart lamp posts equipped with sensors closed circuit cameras and data networks the government said the lamp posts would only collect air quality traffic and weather data although many at the protests said they had covered themselves because of privacy concerns some handed out medical masks while others gave out tinfoil to cover phones credit cards with smart pay functions and smart identity cards that hongkongers are mandated to carry we feel unsafe that s why we have to speak up said harry yip who said he was wearing a hat reflective dark glasses and a black scarf over his face to avoid government surveillance the fear of surveillance comes amid reports that many hong kong residents have been interrogated upon entering mainland china being taken into rooms to have their messages and photos on their phones and computers checked a member of the british consulate in hong kong simon cheng was released on saturday after being detained in china for  days while there on business more broadly the city s demonstrations are aimed at pressurising the hong kong government into responding to protesters political demands including the complete withdrawal of the now suspended extradition bill under which individuals can be sent to china for trial the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence and the free election of hong kong s leaders and legislature many protesters resented a decision by hong kong s metro company mtr on saturday to stop operating trains along a large stretch of a line from pm in an apparent move to stop protesters from reaching the protest in kwun tong resentment against the government and police has reached a dangerous level among the population after numerous violent confrontations between the police and protesters erupted during  weeks of protests in hong kong a regional financial hub once known as one of the world s safest cities in the past two and a half months a hong kong government statement issued close to midnight on saturday strongly condemns protesters for paralysing traffic hurling suspected petrol bombs and bricks at police setting fires and vandalising public property including smart lamp posts it said the government would hold them liable for illegal acts ,Hong Kong Protests,0.353565305
"Demonstrators in Hong Kong have clashed with riot police as the city entered its third consecutive day of mass protests.On Sunday, the police said they had arrested 20 people during Saturday’s clashes for offences including unlawful assembly and assault.Police fired teargas and pepper spray, and pinned protesters to the ground after tense standoffs in at least four locations throughout the city on Saturday evening, following a peaceful march earlier in the day.Thousands of protesters attending an anti-government march in Mong Kok deviated from a pre-approved route and occupied main roads in Kowloon, where they built barricades out of dismantled metal traffic barriers, handed out gas masks and helmets, and prepared to face off against police. In Tsim Sha Tsui, a popular shopping district where protesters had gathered to evade the police, authorities fired multiple rounds of teargas outside a police station after demonstrators had thrown rubbish and traffic cones into the compound. Protesters, protecting themselves with plastic traffic barriers and construction panels, eventually retreated to a nearby university.The police said in a statement that protesters had hurled bricks into the station and set fire to objects outside it. Police were also seen subduing demonstrators outside a police station in Mong Kok by forcing them on the ground. Photos showed demonstrators bleeding.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongThe demonstrations, which began in early June over a proposal to allow extradition to China, have taken on new demands and gained momentum after a violent attack on commuters by suspected triad gangs earlier this month. Residents, opposition lawmakers and protesters have accused the police and government of colluding with the triads to suppress the demonstrations, allegations that Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has denied.In a separate incident, hundreds of residents and demonstrators surrounded police in Wang Tai Sin, a district in New Kowloon, late into the night, where protesters threw helmets and umbrellas at police and demanded they release protesters believed held there. Residents called the police “black society”, a term to refer to gangsters, and chanted: “Hong Kong police, breaking the law!”As clashes continued into the early morning on Sunday, demonstrators yelled at police who pepper-sprayed and fired several rounds of teargas on the group, many of them residents who were not wearing masks or other protective equipment.Earlier in the evening, demonstrators also blocked the entrance to Hong Kong’s cross-harbour tunnel and removed a Chinese flag from a pier and threw it into the sea. A government spokesman condemned protesters for “challenging national sovereignty” while former chief executive CY Leung offered HK$1 million (almost $128,000) to anyone with information about the protesters who damaged the flag.On Saturday, thousands also attended a rival rally held in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park, in support of the police and the government. As the city enters its ninth week of protests, tensions are escalating as Hong Kong authorities have arrested people attending unsanctioned protests and Beijing has also issued increasingly stern threats, hinting at possible military intervention.The protests pose the most serious challenge to China’s authority over the city since 1997, when it was returned from British to Chinese control. On Thursday, Chen Daoxiang, the head of the Chinese army garrison in Hong Kong, said the military was “determined to protect [the] national sovereignty” of Hong Kong and would help put down the “intolerable” unrest if requested. The army released a promotional video showing tanks and soldiers firing on citizens in an anti-riot drill.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. Hong Kong police on Thursday also charged 44 people linked to the protests with “rioting”, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.Others are increasingly worried about violence and escalating police tactics, which have included firing rubber bullets as well as teargas. Police were reportedly testing water cannons.“People are getting more scared,” said Jacqueline Chan. “But it will not change what we do. We will not [stop] because of fear.”“Every time I think it may be the last time but I try my best,” said another protester who asked not to give her name.Despite the arrests and warnings from Beijing, demonstrators are holding rallies for five consecutive days as more segments of Hong Kong society join young demonstrators who have made up the bulk of the protest movement.Thousands of civil servants, medical workers and staff from the city’s finance sector rallied on Thursday and Friday, while further protests were planned for Sunday. Many have called for a citywide strike on Monday, which has been backed by major businesses and unions.The focus of Saturday’s rally continued to be condemning the police but also calling on citizens to take part in the strike on Monday.One group marching held a black banner with the words: “The police have overstepped”, while others chanted for the release of protesters who have been arrested over the last two months of demonstrations.The protesters have vowed to keep fighting and appear to be shifting their tactics. Over the last week, dozens have surrounded police stations where the arrested are believed to be held. Others appear to be focused on gathering more support among the public, or targeting international audiences.“If peaceful marches that disrupt the road for an afternoon or so don’t work, maybe it spills over to blockading more roads, maybe for long. If that doesn’t work? Maybe next time people would besiege a government building … It goes on and on,” said one protester, who asked to only give his first name, Chris.“It’s like a hydra – whether it grows more heads, or its feet have become more threatening, the whole hydra has become a bigger threat.”Still, few protesters are optimistic that their methods will ultimately change how Hong Kong is governed. The local government still ultimately answers to Beijing, which is likely to exert more rather than less control over the city following the protests, according to analysts.Jason Keung, 22, said that even though he does not expect a meaningful change from his government, he still believes it is the duty of people like him to come out.“We have to try to do something in this moment even though this is little or maybe not useful. We still have to try.”",Hong Kong protests: police arrest more than 20 after violent clashes,2019-08-04/03:56:56,demonstrators in hong kong have clashed with riot police as the city entered its third

"Hong Kong protesters have deployed a new strategy of popping up in small groups in multiple locations across the city in an effort to avoid arrest, during their ongoing campaign against police and the local government.Small flashmobs of protesters demonstrated across a dozen districts after a call for protesters to “blossom everywhere” on Sunday, with many staying closer to home where they could evade police on foot or by bus.As teargas was fired against protesters in Shatin and Tsuen Wan districts, 11km (7 miles) apart, demonstrators elsewhere could be seen chanting together inside local malls or vandalising stores with links to pro-government tycoons.The fragmented strategy is in part a response to the politicisation of the city’s MTR subway system, which has remained only semi-functioning since 4 October when chief executive Carrie Lam invoked emergency powers to ban masks at demonstrations.As thousands of residents took to the streets on the night of 4 October, the MTR corporation closed the city’s entire subway line with services suspended for much of the subsequent weekend in an unofficial curfew.Dozens of stations remained closed on the following days because of vandalism while city-wide service has remained limited for the past week, closing hours earlier than normal, with unscheduled station closures in response to demonstrations.The subway once played a vital link allowing protesters to quickly avoid police and cross Hong Kong harbour in their protest strategy known as “be water” – a play on a saying by Hong Kong-American actor Bruce Lee on how to evade one’s enemies.The tactic has become a liability for protesters as riot police have been stationed near the main subway exits on protest days as well as at ferry terminals and other transit points.“Since October, the police are stopping all kinds of people [at the subway],” said Anna, 21, a masked protester who was part of a small unit of demonstrators in Mong Kok shopping district playing cat-and-mouse with half a dozen riot police vehicles.“We are Pien Dei Hoi Fa [blossoming everywhere],” she said, while behind her a group of fellow protesters smashed up a traffic light.Crystal, another 21-year-old protester, said: “The police do not allow us to have a big group of people gathering together. They block all the MTR stations, where the police have arrested [us] many times. The police also stop and search at the MTR stations.” She wore a mask, cap and sunglasses to disguise her identity during the demonstration.She said: “People they just stay around this area. When something happens they can still go home at night without being searched in the tunnel.”Throughout Sunday small groups of protesters would spray many of these locations with graffiti, often smashing windows and doors, before quickly running away as police sirens blared.While vandalism was rife, petrol bombs were only seen in one district by Sunday evening while firelit barricades were also few in number. Once unthinkable on the streets of Hong Kong, such tactics have become the norm as protests push into their fifth month.Police arrested dozens of people on Sunday, including bystanders heckling officers. Demonstrations began in early June against a legislative bill that would have allowed residents to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China. They have since evolved into a citywide movement against both the government and Beijing, with calls for democratic elections as well as a commission to investigate police violence.",Hong Kong protesters use new flashmob strategy to avoid arrest,2019-10-13/15:49:06,hong kong protesters have deployed a new strategy of popping up in small groups in multiple locations across the city in an effort to avoid arrest during their ongoing campaign against police and the local government small flashmobs of protesters demonstrated across a dozen districts after a call for protesters to blossom everywhere on sunday with many staying closer to home where they could evade police on foot or by bus as teargas was fired against protesters in shatin and tsuen wan districts km  miles apart demonstrators elsewhere could be seen chanting together inside local malls or vandalising stores with links to pro government tycoons the fragmented strategy is in part a response to the politicisation of the city s mtr subway system which has remained only semi functioning since  october when chief executive carrie lam invoked emergency powers to ban masks at demonstrations as thousands of residents took to the streets on the night of  october the mtr corporation closed the city s entire subway line with services suspended for much of the subsequent weekend in an unofficial curfew dozens of stations remained closed on the following days because of vandalism while city wide service has remained limited for the past week closing hours earlier than normal with unscheduled station closures in response to demonstrations the subway once played a vital link allowing protesters to quickly avoid police and cross hong kong harbour in their protest strategy known as be water a play on a saying by hong kong american actor bruce lee on how to evade one s enemies the tactic has become a liability for protesters as riot police have been stationed near the main subway exits on protest days as well as at ferry terminals and other transit points since october the police are stopping all kinds of people at the subway said anna  a masked protester who was part of a small unit of demonstrators in mong kok shopping district playing cat and mouse with half a dozen riot police vehicles we are pien dei hoi fa blossoming everywhere she said while behind her a group of fellow protesters smashed up a traffic light crystal another  year old protester said the police do not allow us to have a big group of people gathering together they block all the mtr stations where the police have arrested us many times the police also stop and search at the mtr stations she wore a mask cap and sunglasses to disguise her identity during the demonstration she said people they just stay around this area when something happens they can still go home at night without being searched in the tunnel throughout sunday small groups of protesters would spray many of these locations with graffiti often smashing windows and doors before quickly running away as police sirens blared while vandalism was rife petrol bombs were only seen in one district by sunday evening while firelit barricades were also few in number once unthinkable on the streets of hong kong such tactics have become the norm as protests push into their fifth month police arrested dozens of people on sunday including bystanders heckling officers demonstrations began in early june against a legislative bill that would have allowed residents to be extradited to stand trial in mainland china they have since evolved into a citywide movement against both the government and beijing with calls for democratic elections as well as a commission to investigate police violence ,Hong Kong Protests,0.351099163
"Large numbers of police were on the streets of Hong Kong on Saturday night as officers conducted stop and searches on public transit lines and questioned residents wearing black, the colour adopted by protesters, after a mass rally dispersed to mark the fifth anniversary of the pro-democracy “umbrella movement”.Protesters changed into civilian clothes in alleys and behind walls of umbrellas in districts close to government headquarters, where earlier police fired a water cannon filled with dye and abrasive liquid from behind defensive barriers.Officers in defensive clothing filled Harcourt Road and a highway overpass in front of the government complex hundreds of metres deep as protesters on the frontlines threw rocks at windows and over police barriers.Before the water cannon was fired, a small band of masked protesters lit a flag of the Chinese Communist party on fire, shouting “fuck Communists” and “fight for freedom!” to cheers from nearby crowds.The gathering, however, lasted less than two hours as tactical police arrived on the scene, forcing protesters to flee over road barriers to avoid arrest before larger demonstrations planned for the rest of the week.Some said they would head to Mong Kok police station on the Kowloon peninsula, where protesters have regularly gathered in small numbers to shine lasers and shout at police.Major demonstrations, however, appeared to be over for the night as protesters disappeared into the winding side streets of the historic Central and Sheung Wan districts even as two subway stations on Hong Kong island were closed.Earlier, thousands of peaceful protesters filled Tamar Park on the other side of the government complex to remember the umbrella movement that paralysed Hong Kong for 79 days in 2014, forming the basis for the current protest movement that has roiled the city for the past four months.Before the police-sanctioned rally began in Tamar Park, next to the government buildings, officers raised a red warning flag and fired pepper spray on protesters, who were shining lasers and banging on the gates of the central government building. Protesters dispersed and occupied an adjacent major road.The police said “violent protesters” had damaged property and aimed laser beams at a helicopter, “posing a serious threat to the safety of everyone at the scene”.Later, police used teargas and a water cannon, which sprayed pepper-laced blue dye over protesters who had been throwing rocks over the barrier, shattering windows on the lower level of the government headquarters. They also threw petrol bombs at police.Hong Kong was braced for consecutive days of protests and probable clashes, culminating with anti-government demonstrations on Tuesday to coincide with China’s National Day, a politically important anniversary marking 70 years since the founding of the People’s Republic of China.Hong Kong’s legislature put out a “red alert”, evacuating staff and politicians from the legislative complex, which protesters have previously broken into. Dozens of riot police vans were parked nearby, and water barriers protected the government building.Protesters clad in black, with gas masks and helmets, were also preparing for clashes. “The Hong Kong police are attacking our protesters and the force is unnecessary,” said a 22-year-old man, who planned to be on the frontline of protests to try to protect other demonstrators. He asked not to give his name for fear of arrest.“What we really want is not to fight with police; all we want is to protect the people who are peaceful so they can safely leave,” he said.Earlier on Saturday, protesters hung banners and plastered posters outside the complex, building a “Lennon wall,” named after the John Lennon Wall in Prague, for political graffiti and messages. A group of masked musicians and singers performed the song Glory to Hong Kong, which has become the protesters’ anthem.The Lennon wall stretched around the government complex, where it was originally started in 2014. Demonstrators hung large banners in yellow, the colour of the Umbrella movement, with the words: “We are back.”The protests, which began in June over an extradition bill, have now lasted longer than the Umbrella movement and have expanded both in scope and tactics. The mostly non-violent 2014 protests were concentrated on a major road outside the government buildings.The recent demonstrations have sprung up across the city under the mantra “Be water” – a quote from the actor Bruce Lee. The protesters’ demands echo those in 2014 – the implementation of genuine universal suffrage – but have also demanded an independent inquiry into police behaviour and reforms to the police force, which has lost considerable public trust.The protests have often turned violent, with police firing thousands of rounds of teargas and pepper spray on protesters, as well as deploying water cannon. Protesters have also increasingly been physically attacking critics and people they accuse of being “mainland spies”.As thousands rallied on Friday against the government’s use of a controversial holding centre, a woman was kicked, punched and spray-painted for tearing down posters. Other protesters tried to protect the woman and treat a head wound as the attack continued.“These people started beating me up for no reason,” she said, declining to give her name. She acknowledged she had torn down the protesters’ posters but criticised them for not allowing her to express her views.“It doesn’t mean that people with different political views should be beaten up,” she said. “If you encourage democracy, freedom of speech, this is not the way that people should do [it].”Despite the violence, the protesters maintain broad public support. “If I were 50 years younger, I would be out there at the front with them,” said Ng Yin Fai, 72, who has been joining the protests since June. “If we don’t protest today, we won’t have this chance again.”On Saturday a US academic who testified in a congressional hearing alongside democracy activists last week was denied entry to Hong Kong. Dan Garrett said officials told him he could not enter because of “unspecified immigration reasons”.A government spokesman, responding to protesters’ calls for universal suffrage, said “one man, one vote”was the ultimate goal, as enshrined in Hong Kong’s constitution.“To achieve this aim, the community needs to engage in dialogues, premised on the legal basis and under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust, with a view to narrowing differences and attaining a consensus agreeable to all sides,” the government said in a statement.Residents said that while they were scared of potential arrest or violence from the police, they would continue to protest. “Some of us may feel scared deep inside when we see the police. We feel scared by being simply young or just wearing black,” said Yen, a secretary in her 30s, as she glued black paper stars with the words “Liberate Hong Kong” on to a pavement.She said China’s influence over Hong Kong had grown since the Umbrella movement ended, with the press and freedom of expression being stifled and pro-democracy activists being charged and jailed.“Just being frightened is not an excuse for us, because we have no way back,” she said. “We can’t go back to our normal state where China is taking over.”Additional reporting by Laurel Chor",'Hong Kong can't go back to

"Rights groups and democracy activists have accused police in Hong Kong of using excessive force after teargas was fired into an enclosed subway station and officers posed as protesters before making arrests during an intense weekend of clashes.“Clashes between protesters and police over the weekend escalated to another level especially on the police side,” said Man-Kei Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.Tam cited video footage of police firing teargas into a subway station on Sunday night in Kwai Fong. It was not clear how many protesters were inside the station at the time, but it has been rare for officers to fire tear gas indoors. He also shared footage of police firing non-lethal projectiles at close range as protesters attempted to flee down a separate subway station escalator.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongTam questioned the need for such force in both cases as protesters appeared to be showing “no aggression” towards officers. “These are all very ugly things,” he said.Pro-democracy street protests in Hong Kong stretched into their 10th week on Monday with no sign of either side backing down. The police have also reported injuries among their ranks, including eye irritation from laser pointers and burns from a petrol bomb.Civil Rights Observer, a local rights group that sends observers to protests, said it had “very serious concerns” about police violence and had seen “very clear evidence to show the police are violating their guidelines”, according to its spokesman Icarus Wong.He said the group was particularly concerned by the use of undercover officers for the first time, who later turned on protesters on Sunday night. He said it was unclear if they may have acted as agitators before making mass arrests.During the weekend protests, the website Hong Kong Free Press showed footage of one arrest that appeared to include officers dressing as protesters who injured a demonstrator pressed to the ground. The young man, who said his name was Chow Ka-lok and asked for a lawyer, was left with bleeding head wounds and a broken tooth.Outrage against police violence quickly spread online, where a sit-in at Hong Kong International airport was quickly organised over social media for Monday afternoon.Many residents also shared videos and photos of police violence on Twitter, in some cases under hashtags such as #AbolishHKPF and #HKPoliceState, as well as in Telegram protest groups. One commonly shared photo included an image of a female protester hit by a police projectile and bleeding profusely from her eye.“Let us [admit] HK is a police state. Riot police push down peaceful protestor on the escalator of railway station,” the democracy activist Joshua Wong tweeted.“Hong Kong police repeatedly shooting rubber bullets from 1m distance at protesters who are leaving and entering Taikoo MTR station. How is this acceptable behavior?????” Denise Ho, a cantonese pop star turned activist tweeted.Over the weekend journalists were also attacked by mobs of residents believed to be pro-China supporters in one district on Hong Kong island.“Violence against journalists, whether it comes from the police or pro-Beijing mobs, has become systematic and clearly aims to discourage the media from covering the protests in Hong Kong,” said Cédric Alviani, the head of the Reporters Without Borders East Asia bureau, who called for an independent investigation into protest brutality.On Monday legislators and journalists were also invited to witness a display of police water cannons, which Amnesty warned last week could lead to serious injuries if misused within Hong Kong’s confined spaces.Protests in Hong Kong began in early June against a legislative bill that would have allowed for residents to stand trial in mainland China on criminal charges.While Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, it was promised semi-autonomy for 50 years including a separate legal system.

"Police in Hong Kong are warning of possible violence on the eve of another mass protest against a controversial extradition bill after making “the largest seizure” of explosives in the territory.The seizure came on the day that thousands of pro-government supporters took part in a rally.Millions in the former British colony have thronged the streets since 9 June to protest against a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist party.Many in Hong Kong believe Sunday’s protest, which has been sanctioned by police, will end in violent conflicts, as in previous weeks.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office.

China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongDuring the past two weekends, after tens of thousands of anti-extradition protesters participated in peaceful, sanctioned marches, hundreds have been locked into tense, hours-long standoffs with the police, who then used pepper spray and truncheons on protesters late at night while they tried to leave, arresting dozens and resulting in injuries among many protesters and police officers.Hong Kong police said in a news briefing on Saturday that they had arrested a 27-year-old man on suspicion of possessing explosives, after finding a cache of explosives and weapons in an out-of-town industrial building. Supt Alick McWhirter, of the explosive ordnance disposal unit, said police on Friday night found around 2kg of high explosives, triacetone triperoxide, or TATP, which was “extremely powerful” and unstable.“I think without a doubt, this is the largest seizure we have ever come across in Hong Kong,” he said.Steve Li, senior superintendent of the organised crime and triad bureau, said police also found petrol bombs, corrosive acid, knives as well as metal rods on the premises. Police said they also found anti-extradition bill banners and clothes emblazoned with “Hong Kong National Front”, a pro-independence group.The group’s spokesperson, Baggio Leung, told Hong Kong Free Press that he was not able to confirm why explosives were found there, and would only know more once the suspect was released on bail.In a separate press briefing, police used the discovery of explosives to justify why they have barred the Sunday protest from finishing in Central, the heart of Hong Kong’s business district, as the organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front, had planned.Police instead mandated that the protest should end in Wanchai, before the march reaches Admiralty, where the government headquarters is located, and Central. The move has angered many protesters but the police defended the decision by claiming that some planned to protest away from the approved route and threatened to use weapons.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. “In recent days, after the end of protests … some used the opportunity to create chaos, this includes blocking roads, charging police cordon lines and even damaging public properties and attacking police officers,” Ch Supt John Tse, of the police public relations branch, said, adding that protesters had used metal rods and bricks to damage public properties and attack police.“These make us anxious about the situation tomorrow,” he said.Violent conflicts erupted after peaceful protests in out-of-town districts Sheung Shui and Sha Tin last Saturday and Sunday.Police used truncheons and pepper spray against protesters, who threw objects such as umbrellas and plastic water bottles at them. After being chased by police into a shopping centre in Sha Tin late on Sunday, several protesters were also seen beating a police officer. More than 40 arrests were made.Meanwhile, thousands of government and police supporters – many from pro-China groups – took part in a rally in Admiralty near the government headquarters.“Hong Kong’s prosperity relies on stability and economic success,” said a businessman on stage. “Say no to violence!”",Hong Kong police find explosives on eve of latest protests,2019-07-20/15:17:50,police in hong

"Hong Kong police have come under criticism for charging protesters in a mass transit station in Yuen Long, where some were resting or preparing to leave after clashes with police on Saturday.In scenes that protesters and critics said were reminiscent of an attack on commuters by suspected triad gangs last week, police fired tear gas and rushed into the station shortly before 10pm. The team, a special tactical unit, pepper sprayed and beat people with batons, causing panic. Some protesters attempted to fight back with fire extinguishers. Bloodied gauze and drops of blood could be seen on the station floor.The criticism comes as the city prepared on Sunday for its third consecutive day of mass civil dissent, following Saturday’s rally in Yuen Long and an 11-hour-sit-in at the Hong Kong airport on Friday.Hong Kong’s hospital authority said late on Saturday that 23 people had sought medical help, two in a serious condition. Police have arrested 11 people on suspicion of various charges including unlawful assembly, possession of an offensive weapon, and assault.Images have begun circulating online of the elite tactical squad rushing into the station next to photos of a group of men in white who stormed the same station the previous Sunday. The suspected triads had chased commuters, some of whom were protesters returned from an anti-government demonstration that day, beating them with wooden and metal rods.Less than an hour after the clashes inside Yuen Long station, here’s how the protest Internet has responded First panel shows the pro-government/triad attack last week, second panel shows riot police this evening. pic.twitter.com/SQxAzzkkAn“In action there was no difference,” said Simon Cheng, 34, a Yuen Long resident. “But psychologically it is worse because they are government approved and have deadly force,” he said.In a press briefing in the early hours of Saturday, the police said protesters were throwing fire extinguishers from a bridge at officers below. “We entered the station and got the scene under control,” said senior superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan of the police’s public relations department.Officers were also criticised for using tear gas in residential areas of Yuen Long, including near nursing homes. Liu said the police had fired near residents but no such homes were affected. “We also reminded elderly homes to shut their windows,” she said.Hong Kong has been plunged into political crisis as citizens have taken to the streets every weekend for almost two months to demonstrate against their government.Demonstrators prepared on Sunday to hold a rally in central Hong Kong to condemn the police, who critics say have used increasingly heavy-handed tactics on protesters. Organisers had originally planned to march from central Hong Kong to a western district, where police had fired tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters last weekend.The police did not grant a permit for the march – the second time authorities have rejected a protest request – following a ban on the Saturday rally in Yuen Long. On Sunday, one of the organisers of the Yuen Long rally, Max Chung was arrested by police on suspicion of inciting an illegal assembly. Protesters fear authorities will adopt this line more in the future.“It is very likely they are going to abolish the freedom of assembly. So we are asking people to come out because it may be the last time that we are going to have a peaceful and lawful protest in Hong Kong,” said one of the organisers of the rally.“I’m sure that people are exhausted. It’s already been two months since the first protest ... but I guess people are not going to give up or rest until we legitimately have freedom and democracy,” she said. “It will be a long way to go but everyone in Hong Kong will do what it takes.”",'No difference': Hong Kong police likened to thugs after Yuen Long violence,2019-07-28/07:25:38,hong kong police have come under criticism for charging protesters in a mass transit station in yuen long where some were resting or preparing to leave after clashes with police on saturday in scenes that protesters and critics said were reminiscent of an attack on commuters by suspected triad gangs last week police fired tear gas and rushed into the station shortly before pm the team a special tactical unit pepper sprayed and beat people with batons causing panic some protesters attempted to fight back with fire extinguishers bloodied gauze and drops of blood could be seen on the station floor the criticism comes as the city prepared on sunday for its third consecutive day of mass civil dissent following saturday s rally in yuen long and an  hour sit in at the hong kong airport on friday hong kong s hospital authority said late on saturday that  people had sought medical help two in a serious condition police have arrested  people on suspicion of various charges including unlawful assembly possession of an offensive weapon and assault images have begun circulating online of the elite tactical squad rushing into the station next to photos of a group of men in white who stormed the same station the previous sunday the suspected triads had chased commuters some of whom were protesters returned from an anti government demonstration that day beating them with wooden and metal rods less than an hour after the clashes inside yuen long station here s how the protest internet has responded first panel shows the pro government triad attack last week second panel shows riot police this evening pic twitter com sqxazzkkan in action there was no difference said simon cheng  a yuen long resident but psychologically it is worse because they are government approved and have deadly force he said in a press briefing in the early hours of saturday the police said protesters were throwing fire extinguishers from a bridge at officers below we entered the station and got the scene under control said senior superintendent yolanda yu hoi kwan of the police s public relations department officers were also criticised for using tear gas in residential areas of yuen long including near nursing homes liu said the police had fired near residents but no such homes were affected we also reminded elderly homes to shut their windows she said hong kong has been plunged into political crisis as citizens have taken to the streets every weekend for almost two months to demonstrate against their government demonstrators prepared on sunday to hold a rally in central hong kong to condemn the police who critics say have used increasingly heavy handed tactics on protesters organisers had originally planned to march from central hong kong to a western district where police had fired tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters last weekend the police did not grant a permit for the march the second time authorities have rejected a protest request following a ban on the saturday rally in yuen long on sunday one of the organisers of the yuen long rally max chung was arrested by police on suspicion of inciting an illegal assembly protesters fear authorities will adopt this line more in the future it is very likely they are going to abolish the freedom of assembly so we are asking people to come out because it may be the last time that we are going to have a peaceful and lawful protest in hong kong said one of the organisers of the rally i m sure that people are exhausted it s already been two months since the first protest but i guess people are not going to give up or rest until we legitimately have freedom and democracy she said it will be a long way to go but everyone in hong kong will do what it takes ,Hong Kong Protests,0.334468484
"Conflict has broken out between hundreds of protesters and police in riot gear in Hong Kong after tens of thousands of protesters marched peacefully earlier in the day to keep up the pressure on the government to withdraw its controversial extradition bill.The march, which continued late into the night, was the first since the storming and vandalising of Hong Kong’s legislature by protesters last Monday, a move that drew strong condemnation from the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. The extradition bill – which would allow suspects to be removed from the semi-autonomous city to face China’s flawed justice system – has been the subject of several mass rallies over the past month.The demonstration descended into chaos shortly before 11pm local time on Sunday with most protesters retreating and yelling “Leave now! Leave now!” as police in riot gear began to advance towards them. Police used truncheons to beat protesters, who were trapped as police advanced towards them in both directions, and pressed some of them on to the ground.Six people were arrested, according to a statement from the police just after 3am Monday morning. One protester was detained for “failing to produce proof of identity” and the five others were arrested for assaulting a police officer or obstructing the police.“Police respect the public’s freedoms of expression, speech and assembly. It is the policy of the police to facilitate all peaceful public events while at the same time ensuring public safety and public order. Police strongly condemn the illegal acts of protesters for blocking the roads,” the statement said.The atmosphere had turned tense earlier, with protesters who armed themselves with umbrellas and police in riot gear locked in a stand-off in the commercial district of Mongkok.The march – which had been given official permission by the police – started around 3.30pm local time at a park by the harbour front at Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon peninsula, an area popular with tourists. Organisers estimated as many as 230,000 participated in the march, more than was expected. Police said only 56,000 attended.Although it officially ended by early evening, when most of the crowds dispersed after reaching the West Kowloon railway terminus, where high-speed trains link Hong Kong with Chinese cities, protesters began to fill the commercial area in Tsim Sha Tsui in the evening.Late into the evening, protesters continued to march down Nathan Road, the main thoroughfare in Kowloon, occupying half a street. They chanted slogans as they marched northwards, passing Yau Ma Tei and heading towards Mong Kok. After reaching Mongkok, police in riot gear formed into a line to stop protesters from advancing and demanded that they left.“Cruel police! Cruel police!” chanted protesters, wearing goggles, masks and holding up umbrellas to shield themselves in case police shot tear gas.“I’d rather sit at home enjoying air-conditioning in this hot weather, but it is the government who forced us to keep protesting,” said a young man who declined to be identified.Although Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam has offered to meet university student representatives behind closed doors, he said she had showed no sign of giving in to any of the protesters’ political demands and he was tired of Lam “sounding like a broken record” in her reiteration of her position.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has apologised for the crisis, but protesters have demanded that the government fully withdraw the bill and release all those arrested in previous protests.They also want the government to launch an independent investigation into the police’s use of force on 12 June, when teargas, rubber bullets and truncheons were used on largely peaceful crowds. Protesters also called on the government to implement universal suffrage.“We want genuine universal suffrage!”, “Free Hong Kong!”, “Hong Kongers, go for it!”, and “Retract the bill!”, chanted the spirited and noisy crowds to the rhythms of occasional drum beats earlier in the day.Some held up yellow banners and umbrellas to call for universal suffrage. Several waved giant colonial-era flags – which include the British union flag – while others and blue flags emblazoned with “Hong Kong Independence”.Umbrellas were the symbol of the last major set of protests in Hong Kong, the 79-day Umbrella Movement in 2014, which demanded an unfettered vote for ordinary citizens after China ruled that all candidates for Hong Kong’s top leadership job must receive over half of the votes from a largely pro-Beijing nominating committee of 1,200 members, which would select two or three candidates, before going before voters. The civil disobedience movement failed to press Beijing to grant genuine universal suffrage and this has become a source of political tension ever since.“I am here to support the young people. It is our fault that we hadn’t spoken out earlier to fight for more freedoms so the task is upon the young now. And they’re so desperate and despondent,” said 68-year-old Mary, who did not wish to give her last name, referring to last Monday’s storming of the legislature building.Hong Kong’s authorities appeared nervous that Sunday’s march might turn violent. Police erected giant water-filled barricades outside the West Kowloon railway terminus and closed many entrances to stop protesters from getting in. They also closed and diverted several roads in the area for the protest. The railway company suspended sales of tickets for high-speed trains to and from the terminus on Sunday afternoon.Emotions have been running high in Hong Kong over the past month during its biggest political crisis in decades. Millions of people have thronged the streets to protest against a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist party.Tensions erupted last Monday, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s 1997 return from British to Chinese rule, when hundreds of angry protesters stormed and vandalised the legislature. Police fired teargas after midnight to disperse them.Protesters on Sunday said even though police had started arresting people involved in earlier protests, it would not dampen their resolve. “We will keep coming out until the government respond to us. If they keep ignoring us, people can only escalate their fight,” said a young woman who gave her name as Mimi.“The government doesn’t give a damn about us – protesting is our only hope,” said Vivian Li, a mother of two toddlers.",Conflict breaks out in Hong Kong after latest extradition bill protests,2019-07-08/04:29:40,conflict has broken out between hundreds of protesters and police in riot

"About a thousand people have held a noisy rally outside the police headquarters in downtown Hong Kong, calling for the release of protesters arrested during this month’s wave of political unrest, following a peaceful demonstration earlier on Wednesday.The protesters, mostly dressed in black and many covering their faces with masks and wearing hard hats, occupied the streets around the police headquarters in Wan Chai after 10pm and chanted loudly “Shame on you” and “Release the righteous fighters” to the beating of drums.Some used crowd-control barriers to form a barricade between the front entrance of the police headquarters and the protesters, while others placed barriers in front of the compound’s gates.At one point, to the cheering of the crowds, a young man sprayed painted obscenities in large Chinese and English characters on the front wall of the police headquarters and unfurled a large Chinese scroll down the side of the building emblazoned with the message “Release the righteous fighters”.Protesters also sprayed painted slogans on to walls around the compound, on doors as well as security cameras. Some tried to obscure cameras with umbrellas.Police were seen standing guards inside the compound, with some wearing riot helmets and carrying shields.Hong Kong has been rocked by its biggest political crisis in decades as millions have thronged to the streets this month to protest against a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals, including foreign nationals, to mainland China to stand trial.Police used teargas and rubber bullets to disperse hundreds of thousands of people occupying the main thoroughfares outside the government headquarters on 12 June, drawing condemnation from international rights groups. Police said last week that 32 had been arrested over the demonstrations and five have been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment.Earlier in the evening, thousands of people gathered by the harbour front in the heart of Hong Kong’s central business district to continue the fight for the withdrawal of the controversial extradition law and to demand democracy.The peaceful rally on Wednesday evening was aimed at keeping international attention on Hong Kong before the G20 summit in Japan, where the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, are expected to meet later this week.China has said it will not allow the G20 nations to discuss Hong Kong at the summit in Osaka, Japan.“Free Hong Kong. Democracy now. Withdraw the evil law,” chanted the crowds, most of whom were wearing black.Many who took part in Wednesday’s rally said they were frustrated by the refusal of the Hong Kong chief executive, Carrie Lam, to meet their demands.After earlier mass protests, Lam suspended the extradition bill and apologised for the social disharmony caused, but stopped short of withdrawing it and condemning the police’s use of force.“I want to let the world know that we won’t give up. We want democracy and freedom for Hong Kong,” said Alfred Liu, a trader in his 50s. “China is afraid of foreign pressure, but while it still needs Hong Kong, we must seize the opportunity to keep the pressure on.”A speaker on the stage told the protesters: “We must tell the whole world how Carrie Lam’s administration has betrayed us – they refused to withdraw the bill and used excessive violence. We’re here because we don’t want the Communist party’s puppet to represent us, right?” The crowd applauded and cheered.Earlier in the day, hundreds marched towards 19 foreign consulates to lobby international governments about the political crisis. Many of the protesters wore white T-shirts emblazoned with the message: “Liberate Hong Kong”, held up placards and chanted slogans, including: “Free Hong Kong”.On their arrival, protesters read out their petition letters before handing them to consulate officials.“In desperation we seek your engagement and assistance to fight back against this authoritarian regime with us,” a protester read from a letter addressed to Trump.",Hong Kong protesters hold noisy rally outside police headquarters,2019-06-26/18:43:54,about a thousand people have held a noisy rally outside the police headquarters in downtown hong kong calling for the release of protesters arrested during this month s wave of political unrest following a peaceful demonstration earlier on wednesday the protesters mostly dressed in black and many covering their faces with masks and wearing hard hats occupied the streets around the police headquarters in wan chai after pm and chanted loudly shame on you and release the righteous fighters to the beating of drums some used crowd control barriers to form a barricade between the front entrance of the police headquarters and the protesters while others placed barriers in front of the compound s gates at one point to the cheering of the crowds a young man sprayed painted obscenities in large chinese and english characters on the front wall of the police headquarters and unfurled a large chinese scroll down the side of the building emblazoned with the message release the righteous fighters protesters also sprayed painted slogans on to walls around the compound on doors as well as security cameras some tried to obscure cameras with umbrellas police were seen standing guards inside the compound with some wearing riot helmets and carrying shields hong kong has been rocked by its biggest political crisis in decades as millions have thronged to the streets this month to protest against a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals including foreign nationals to mainland china to stand trial police used teargas and rubber bullets to disperse hundreds of thousands of people occupying the main thoroughfares outside the government headquarters on  june drawing condemnation from international rights groups police said last week that  had been arrested over the demonstrations and five have been charged with rioting which carries a maximum sentence of  years imprisonment earlier in the evening thousands of people gathered by the harbour front in the heart of hong kong s central business district to continue the fight for the withdrawal of the controversial extradition law and to demand democracy the peaceful rally on wednesday evening was aimed at keeping international attention on hong kong before the g summit in japan where the chinese president xi jinping and his us counterpart donald trump are expected to meet later this week china has said it will not allow the g nations to discuss hong kong at the summit in osaka japan free hong kong democracy now withdraw the evil law chanted the crowds most of whom were wearing black many who took part in wednesday s rally said they were frustrated by the refusal of the hong kong chief executive carrie lam to meet their demands after earlier mass protests lam suspended the extradition bill and apologised for the social disharmony caused but stopped short of withdrawing it and condemning the police s use of force i want to let the world know that we won t give up we want democracy and freedom for hong kong said alfred liu a trader in his s china is afraid of foreign pressure but while it still needs hong kong we must seize the opportunity to keep the pressure on a speaker on the stage told the protesters we must tell the whole world how carrie lam s administration has betrayed us they refused to withdraw the bill and used excessive violence we re here because we don t want the communist party s puppet to represent us right the crowd applauded and cheered earlier in the day hundreds marched towards  foreign consulates to lobby international governments about the political crisis many of the protesters wore white t shirts emblazoned with the message liberate hong kong held up placards and chanted slogans including free hong kong on their arrival protesters read out their petition letters before handing them to consulate officials in desperation we seek your engagement and assistance to fight back against this authoritarian regime with us a protester read from a letter addressed to trump ,Hong Kong Protests,0.328332931
"Anti-government protesters in Hong Kong took over key roads early on Monday amid rising tensions ahead of what expected to be a huge pro-democracy rally on the anniversary of the city’s handover to China.The semi-autonomous city has been shaken by historic demonstrations in the past month, when protesters have demanded the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland.While an official ceremony took place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre to mark the 22nd anniversary of the return of sovereignty from Britain to China, tensions spiked once more in the financial hub after hundreds of mainly young, masked protesters mostly in black wearing hard hats and goggles seized three key thoroughfares, some deploying metal and plastic barriers to block the way.Rows of riot police with helmets and shields faced protesters on Harcourt Road, the main thoroughfare, and a couple of the side streets in the area. Hundreds of protesters shouted “retract the evil law” in the torrential rain at one point.One protester told the Guardian he was pepper-sprayed by riot police in the early morning when he was among dozens of protesters advancing towards the police line. His friends were dabbing water on his skin, which was still red and hurting.“We were lucky we didn’t get seriously hurt as police were using batons to hit people -- we shielded ourselves with umbrellas,” he said.On Lung Wo Road, some protesters dug up bricks and built make-shift barricades from roadside metal railings.The ongoing rallies are the latest manifestation of growing fears that China is stamping down on the city’s freedoms and culture with the help of the finance hub’s pro-Beijing leaders.Although Hong Kong was returned from British to Chinese rule on 1 July, 1997, it is still administered separately under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems”.The city enjoys rights and liberties unseen on the autocratic mainland, but many residents fear Beijing is already reneging on that deal.While top officials attend a ceremony on 1 July every year to mark the anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover of sovereignty from the UK to China, a large anti-government protest also takes place on the same day, with protesters calling for greater democratic freedoms – such as the right to elect the city’s leader.There have been large-scale protests in Hong Kong in recent years, including a two-month occupation in 2014 – but have failed to win any concessions from Beijing.If huge crowds gather today, as expected, this will be Hong Kong’s fourth mass protest in a month against a controversial extradition law.This year’s rally comes against the backdrop of unprecedented anti-government protests over the past three weeks that have drawn millions and anger over police using tear gas and rubber bullets to clear crowds.Millions have taken to the streets to protest against the proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals for trial in mainland China, where the opaque court system is controlled by the Communist party.The protests throughout June have been largely peaceful, but on 12 June, the scene turned violent when police used rubber bullets, teargas, pepper spray and batons to disperse crowds and some protesters threw objects back at the police. Protesters have also surrounded the police headquarters twice in past weeks in noisy and emotionally charged protests in which young people spray-painted obscenities on its front wall and barricaded its entrances.On Sunday, police set up giant water-filled barricades in anticipation of overnight rallies by anti-extradition protesters to lock down the area where the handover anniversary ceremony was to take place.While the spark for the current wave of protests was an attempt by chief executive Carrie Lam to pass the Beijing-backed extradition law, the demonstrations have morphed into a wider movement against Lam’s administration and Beijing.Lam – who has kept out of the public eye since her climbdown and has record low approval ratings – struck a conciliatory note Monday at the ceremony marking the handover, saying a series of protests that have rocked her city have taught her that she needs to listen better to the youth and people in general.Before toasting with Hong Kong and Chinese officials, including military figures, Lam also said Hong Kong benefited from China’s economic strength and wished for the “affluence of the motherland and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.”On Monday, the government announced that the flag-raising ceremony would be moved inside, rather than on the city’s harbour front, ostensibly due to inclement weather, but probably to avoid the loud protests outside the venue.Eddy Chu Hoi-dick, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said while he worries about violence breaking out, he believes the young protesters in the leaderless protests have “consensus about when they should back down” and avoid arrest.On Sunday, thousands of pro-government protesters rallied outside the government headquarters in support of the city’s police.Many waved Chinese flags and hurled insults at anti-government demonstrators camped nearby, highlighting the deep ideological fissures now dividing the finance hub.",Hong Kong: protesters take to streets on

"Protesters in Hong Kong closed tax, immigration and local government buildings, blockaded key roads through the city centre and massed in their thousands outside police headquarters to demand the release of detained activists and an apology for police brutality.Friday’s was the fourth major demonstration in the city in less than two weeks, and although smaller than the others, the crowd was committed, still filling the streets for more than 15 hours after an early morning start.Hong Kong has been electrified by the protests, initially called to oppose an extradition bill that would have allowed residents and visitors to be sent for trial in China’s opaque, Communist party-controlled courts.After police used teargas, rubber bullets and pepper spray against protesters last week, organisers’ demands have expanded to include an investigation into the violence and an end to the government crackdown on demonstrators. The police headquarters was a focus for much of Friday’s protests.“The police didn’t do justice to the citizens. They actually attacked us with teargas and unnecessary force,” said one young protester in the crowd outside. “We came here to tell the police we are not happy with what they did.”Like most there, he was wearing a mask and didn’t want to be named. A roundup of activists, including arrests in hospitals, has left many wary of being identified in case they are targeted. At least five face charges of rioting which carry heavy sentences and protesters also want these dropped.The rights group Amnesty International said an investigation using verified footage showed police had used unjustified force and broken international law. Violations included beating subdued protesters, firing rubber bullets at a protester’s head and using teargas on trapped crowds.“Police officers appear out of control, placing peaceful protesters who posed no threat in danger of serious injury,” said Man-kei Tam, Amnesty’s Hong Kong director.Crowd chants included “Release them,” in support of the jailed activists, and “Evil police.” Opposition leaders including the recently released Joshua Wong gave speeches. A phalanx of hymn-singing activists even managed to temporarily stop a police van from entering.Without a police permit to hold a demonstration, organisers had urged people to turn up early outside government offices to “picnic, sing, stroll, watch the turtles and keep off the rain”, all barely veiled calls to political action.The scale of public anger over the extradition bill and heavy-handed policing has already forced the Hong Kong chief executive, Carrie Lam, to publicly apologise and suspend the legislation.Critics fear that the law would fatally damage the territory’s economy and undermine free speech and religion. Some tycoons have already started moving assets abroad or backed away from deals, the New York Times reported, although few spoke out publicly until the protest movement took off.Lam has said the law is almost as good as dead, but protesters and opposition leaders are keeping up the pressure because they fear the government could take up the legislation again once public anger is defused.A pro-Beijing legislator suggested on Friday it could be reintroduced within months, although her party distanced itself from the claim.“I originally didn’t support this,” said a 70-year-old man watching Friday’s protests. He gave his name as Kava. “But peaceful protests are not working so there is nothing else that the people can do.”The early crowd, just a few hundred strong at the 7am start time, gathered by police headquarters and the legislative council. As numbers grew, groups shut off several roads, blockaded police into their own headquarters and later swarmed to government office buildings.In the lobbies of Immigration Tower and Revenue Tower protesters held sit-ins until office workers were sent home at about 3pm and they moved on to other locations.Widespread public outrage over the police violence helped spur a record 2 million people – over a quarter of the city’s population – on to the streets for an entirely peaceful protest on Sunday.In response, authorities appeared to have taken a softer approach to crowd control on Friday. The legislature was closed for the day, and there was only a small police presence in the surrounding area.Police in riot gear stared out for hours at the hostile crowd outside their headquarters, and periodically warned them the gathering was illegal, but did not try to break it up.Opposition leaders at the protest called on the crowds to stay calm. “Look after those around you.

"A pilot, a nurse and several teenage students were among 40 people who appeared in a Hong Kong courtroom on Wednesday facing up to 10 years in jail on rioting charges over their role in mass protests that have convulsed the city since June.Anger at the potential heavy sentences brought hundreds of demonstrators to the courtroom doors in support of the group inside, chanting “revolution of our time” and “liberate Hong Kong”.Rights groups warned that the riot charge and heavy-handed policing showed a “flagrant disregard” of city residents’ rights and appeared aimed mostly at stifling dissent, as authorities grapple with the worst political crisis since the handover from British rule in 1997.The threat of rioting charges has been a source of anger since the protest movement began in early June, but this is the first time they have been deployed against demonstrators.“By using such vague charges against pro-democracy protesters, the Hong Kong authorities seem intent on sending a chilling warning to anyone considering taking part in future protests,” Amnesty International said in a statement.Hong Kong law defines rioting as the unlawful assembly of three or more people, where any person “commits a breach of the peace”.The arrests were made over peaceful protests at the weekend that turned violent, with police unleashing teargas and rubber bullets against demonstrators who hurled umbrellas, rocks, eggs and gas canisters back at officers.“While there was violence over the weekend, the definitions of illegal assembly and rioting under Hong Kong law are so broad they fall far short of international standards,” Amnesty said. “It is highly questionable that individuals facing these sweeping charges would have a fair chance of defending themselves at trial.”In a sign of how broad-based support for the protests has been, the people arrested ranged from a pilot with the city’s flagship airline Cathy Pacific, to a chef, an electrician and a construction worker, according to local news reports. The youngest is 16, the oldest 41.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongMost were released on bail of around HK$1000 (£104), with a curfew from midnight to 6am, and many ordered to stay in Hong Kong.Protests were originally spurred by concerns over a now-shelved extradition law, that would have effectively removed the legal firewall between Hong Kong and China. But they have expanded to cover fury at police brutality, and wider questions about the future of Hong Kong as an autonomous city within an ever-more assertive China.And while the riot charges and the prospect of long sentences may have alarmed some would-be protesters, for others it has just increased their fury.“I’m not scared to protest. This whole thing today is just making me more angry,” said Gartner, a 21-year-old protester outside the court who declined to give his full name.The arrests had already spurred fresh unrest on Tuesday evening, as hundreds of protesters gathered at police stations where the group was being held, and faced riot police who deployed pepper spray and batons to try and disperse the crowd.Photos of a policeman pointing a shotgun at protesters near Kwai Chung police station circulated rapidly, spurring outrage. Police said the weapon was loaded only with non-lethal bean bags, and was being used because the officer felt under threat.In one video circulated on social media, a police officer was seen punching a photographer, then wildly waving a baton at a journalist, who was wearing a yellow vest and who was forced to flee.Outside Tin Shui Wai station, it the early hours of Wednesday morning, a private car drove by and let off fireworks towards the crowd, injuring six. There were no immediate arrests although police said they strongly condemned the attack.Adding to the sense of crisis in Hong Kong as the position of authorities and protesters appeared to harden, a senior official from Donald Trump’s administration said on Wednesday that the United States was monitoring what appeared to be a buildup of Chinese forces on the border, Bloomberg news agency reported.The exact nature of the military buildup was unclear, the unnamed official said, but armed police or military appeared to be gathering just outside Hong Kong territory.China warned on Monday, in a rare direct intervention, that violent protesters should be swiftly punished. Despite peaceful protests drawing a reported 2 million people, a government official blamed the unrest on a “few radicals”.“No civilised society or rule of law society will tolerate rampant violence,” said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the office which handles Hong Kong and Macau events for Beijing. It was the first time the office has given a press conference since the 1997 handover from colonial rule.“In our view, the most dangerous situation in Hong Kong is that violent crimes have not been

"Thousands of protesters are continuing to defy a ban on wearing masks in Hong Kong as clashes have again taken place between demonstrators and authorities.A petrol bomb was thrown at the gate of a metro station, and two government offices and a cafe were vandalised, although the mood on Saturday was less tense than at recent protests because police had not used teargas.Late on Saturday, however, the mood changed when police fired a shot outside the Mong Kok police station. The shot, possibly a rubber bullet or sponge round, was fired after a small group of protesters shouted obscenities and shone laser at police officers, who rushed out to subdue and beat a couple of young men.Earlier in the day, crowds of people mostly dressed in black gathered at the seafront of the tourist area of Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday afternoon before marching against the government’s invocation of the colonial-era emergency regulations ordinance just over a week ago.The application of the law bypassed the legislature to forbid the use of facemasks at protests and public assemblies in an attempt to quell anti-government protests that are in their 18th week.Since the ordinance was implemented, however, it has provoked several more violent demonstrations as people who feared the government would arbitrarily introduce more draconian measures to suppress civil liberties.Many protesters wore medical masks on Saturday but a few also wore balaclavas. A large number of riot police were deployed in different districts along the route of the march, with protesters taking over the main thoroughfare, bringing traffic to a standstill.Onlookers jeered and yelled obscenities at officers who wore black face masks and obscured their police numbers.The atmosphere became tense when an officer rushed up to a young couple who wore medical masks but were not part of the protest. “Take off your bloody masks. Show your identity cards,” he shouted. Another officer said: “See a doctor if you’re ill.”Passersby shouted back at police. One young father, holding his infant daughter, told them: “Beware of what sort of a world you’re creating for your own children.” Several police officers rushed up to intimidate him.His wife said through tears: “We’re protesting today precisely because we have a child. If we don’t speak up for others now, who will speak up for us?”Outside Prince Edward metro station, people lit incense and paid their respects at a makeshift shrine decorated with white flowers. Many believed people died at the scene after being beaten by police in late August, and have accused the government of a cover-up.A 55-year-old man, who burst into tears after bowing in front of the shrine, said: “I’m convinced that people have died here – I have no trust in the government.”A police officer shouted at and pointed a metal stick at the face of an elderly woman who was trying to mediate between him and an angry protester, leaving her trembling.Meanwhile, marchers vandalised two government offices and a coffee shop seen as being pro-Beijing, and a petrol bomb was thrown at the gate of a metro station not on the route of the protest. No one was hurt in the incident.Protesters smashed glass and sprayed graffiti on the walls of the Kowloon and Cheung Sha Wan government offices. Police said the demonstrators also entered the Cheung Sha Wan offices and started a fire.Elsewhere, hundreds of masked protesters chanted slogans such as “I have every right to wear a mask” and sang the protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong at a shopping centre in Sha Tin. Some had their faces painted while others played musical instruments.A 15-year-old student said: “I can’t refrain from wearing a mask just because of fear. We should resist an unjust law and an unjust regime.”Dozens of older people staged a sit-in protest outside the police headquarters to protest against the beating and arrests of people as young as 12. Hong Kong officials said one-third of the more than 2,200 protesters arrested during the four months of unrest were under 18.Hong Kong police issued a statement condemning vandalism and unauthorised assembly.",Hong Kong protesters defy ban on masks as they clash with police,2019-10-12/15:15:30,thousands of protesters are continuing to defy a ban on wearing masks in hong kong as clashes have again taken place between demonstrators and authorities a petrol bomb was thrown at the gate of a metro station and two government offices and a cafe were vandalised although the mood on saturday was less tense than at recent protests because police had not used teargas late on saturday however the mood changed when police fired a shot outside the mong kok police station the shot possibly a rubber bullet or sponge round was fired after a small group of protesters shouted obscenities and shone laser at police officers who rushed out to subdue and beat a couple of young men earlier in the day crowds of people mostly dressed in black gathered at the seafront of the tourist area of tsim sha tsui on saturday afternoon before marching against the government s invocation of the colonial era emergency regulations ordinance just over a week ago the application of the law bypassed the legislature to forbid the use of facemasks at protests and public assemblies in an attempt to quell anti government protests that are in their th week since the ordinance was implemented however it has provoked several more violent demonstrations as people who feared the government would arbitrarily introduce more draconian measures to suppress civil liberties many protesters wore medical masks on saturday but a few also wore balaclavas a large number of riot police were deployed in different districts along the route of the march with protesters taking over the main thoroughfare bringing traffic to a standstill onlookers jeered and yelled obscenities at officers who wore black face masks and obscured their police numbers the atmosphere became tense when an officer rushed up to a young couple who wore medical masks but were not part of the protest take off your bloody masks show your identity cards he shouted another officer said see a doctor if you re ill passersby shouted back at police one young father holding his infant daughter told them beware of what sort of a world you re creating for your own children several police officers rushed up to intimidate him his wife said through tears we re protesting today precisely because we have a child if we don t speak up for others now who will speak up for us outside prince edward metro station people lit incense and paid their respects at a makeshift shrine decorated with white flowers many believed people died at the scene after being beaten by police in late august and have accused the government of a cover up a  year old man who burst into tears after bowing in front of the shrine said i m convinced that people have died here i have no trust in the government a police officer shouted at and pointed a metal stick at the face of an elderly woman who was trying to mediate between him and an angry protester leaving her trembling meanwhile marchers vandalised two government offices and a coffee shop seen as being pro beijing and a petrol bomb was thrown at the gate of a metro station not on the route of the protest no one was hurt in the incident protesters smashed glass and sprayed graffiti on the walls of the kowloon and cheung sha wan government offices police said the demonstrators also entered the cheung sha wan offices and started a fire elsewhere hundreds of masked protesters chanted slogans such as i have every right to wear a mask and sang the protest anthem glory to hong kong at a shopping centre in sha tin some had their faces painted while others played musical instruments a  year old student said i can t refrain from wearing a mask just because of fear we should resist an unjust law and an unjust regime dozens of older people staged a sit in protest outside the police headquarters to protest against the beating and arrests of people as young as  hong kong officials said one third of the more than   protesters arrested during the four months of unrest were under  hong kong police issued a statement condemning vandalism and unauthorised assembly ,Hong Kong Protests,0.321054131
"A newly composed song has become the rallying point for Hong Kong’s anti-government movement this week as thousands gathered at shopping centres and a football match to sing what protesters have embraced as their unofficial anthem: Glory to Hong Kong.The singing sessions have spread across the city this week, coming as a respite after weeks of intensifying violent clashes between protesters and police in an ongoing political crisis that has entered its fourth month.Thousands of people gathered across multiple floors of suburban shopping centres in various locations across Hong Kong every night this week to sing the protest song.On Thursday lunchtime, a rival camp waving the Chinese national flags and singing the Chinese national anthem turned up at the upmarket IFC shopping centre in the Central business district, prompting many onlookers and office workers to sing Glory to Hong Kong in retaliation.The two sides tried to drown out one another with songs and slogans and many got into a shouting match.In the evening, hundreds gathered at the IFC shopping centre again, singing Glory to Hong Kong and Do you hear the People Sing. Many shouted the slogan: “Reclaim Hong Kong, Revolution of our time”. People also gathered at Times Square, another popular downtown shopping centre on Hong Kong island, tonight and hung up the banner “I want democracy”.During a World Cup qualifying match on Tuesday night, fans booed the Chinese national anthem and sang Glory to Hong Kong. They repeatedly chanted “Liberate Hong Kong” as they waved a black version of the territory’s Bauhinia flag, a symbol of resistance in the protests.Many Hongkongers say the singing lifts their spirits and boosts morale in their fight for democracy and basic rights. Some, tired of violent clashes in recent protests, said the singing was a powerful tool of solidarity and determination.“The song spells out our heartfelt feelings. It is a song that stands for our fight,” said a 33-year-old man who gave his surname as Hung, who participated in singing at the football match and at a shopping centre on Wednesday.Hung said singing was a good way of uniting supporters of the movement, on top of other non-violent expressions such as human chains and Lennon Walls – where people post sticky notes with pro-democracy messages – in communities across Hong Kong.“Why are tears flowing on this land? Why are people angry? We lift our heads, we reject silence and we yearn for freedom with our resounding voices,” said the opening verse.Words like “freedom”, “glory”, “courage” pepper the song, which finishes with a verse calling for democracy, justice and freedom and “a return of glory to Hong Kong in this era of revolution” – a slogan frequently used in the current wave of protests.Last Wednesday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam belatedly announced the full withdrawal of a controversial extradition, which in June sparked the wave of demonstrations.The withdrawal was one of five key demands of the demonstrators. She did not respond to protesters’ other demands, which include an independent inquiry into police behaviour, amnesty for those arrested, and democratic reforms to give Hong Kong residents universal suffrage.“We don’t want to give up. One demand has been met, but we don’t want to give up on the rest, we have to persist,” Hung said.",'Glory to Hong Kong': pro-democracy anthem embraced by protesters,2019-09-12/06:33:36,a newly composed song has become the rallying point for hong kong s anti government movement this week as thousands gathered at shopping centres and a football match to sing what protesters have embraced as their unofficial anthem glory to hong kong the singing sessions have spread across the city this week coming as a respite after weeks of intensifying violent clashes between protesters and police in an ongoing political crisis that has entered its fourth month thousands of people gathered across multiple floors of suburban shopping centres in various locations across hong kong every night this week to sing the protest song on thursday lunchtime a rival camp waving the chinese national flags and singing the chinese national anthem turned up at the upmarket ifc shopping centre in the central business district prompting many onlookers and office workers to sing glory to hong kong in retaliation the two sides tried to drown out one another with songs and slogans and many got into a shouting match in the evening hundreds gathered at the ifc shopping centre again singing glory to hong kong and do you hear the people sing many shouted the slogan reclaim hong kong revolution of our time people also gathered at times square another popular downtown shopping centre on hong kong island tonight and hung up the banner i want democracy during a world cup qualifying match on tuesday night fans booed the chinese national anthem and sang glory to hong kong they repeatedly chanted liberate hong kong as they waved a black version of the territory s bauhinia flag a symbol of resistance in the protests many hongkongers say the singing lifts their spirits and boosts morale in their fight for democracy and basic rights some tired of violent clashes in recent protests said the singing was a powerful tool of solidarity and determination the song spells out our heartfelt feelings it is a song that stands for our fight said a  year old man who gave his surname as hung who participated in singing at the football match and at a shopping centre on wednesday hung said singing was a good way of uniting supporters of the movement on top of other non violent expressions such as human chains and lennon walls where people post sticky notes with pro democracy messages in communities across hong kong why are tears flowing on this land why are people angry we lift our heads we reject silence and we yearn for freedom with our resounding voices said the opening verse words like freedom glory courage pepper the song which finishes with a verse calling for democracy justice and freedom and a return of glory to hong kong in this era of revolution a slogan frequently used in the current wave of protests last wednesday hong kong leader carrie lam belatedly announced the full withdrawal of a controversial extradition which in june sparked the wave of demonstrations the withdrawal was one of five key demands of the demonstrators she did not respond to protesters other demands which include an independent inquiry into police behaviour amnesty for those arrested and democratic reforms to give hong kong residents universal suffrage we don t want to give up one demand has been met but we don t want to give up on the rest we have to persist hung said ,Hong Kong Protests,0.321011037
"Hong Kong riot police have stormed a metro station, using batons to beat passengers as violent clashes deepened political unrest in the city for the 13th weekend in a row.Lai, 31, returning home from protests, was in a train car that pulled into the Prince Edward mass transit railway stop in Kowloon just before 11pm on Saturday night. He saw at least 20 police officers on the station platform when suddenly five or six ran into his carriage.“Everyone started to scream ‘they are coming, they’re crazy’,” Lai said. “They kept moving and hitting everyone in the car. I started running. I saw police using their batons to keep hitting the same person on the head, even though he was kneeling down in the corner,” he said.Video footage showed police pepper spraying protesters inside the train car, chasing and arresting others on the train platform and ordering them to kneel against a wall with their hands on the heads. One man could be seen bleeding from the head.In a statement, police said they had entered the station after protesters damaged a customer service centre and ticket machines, as well as assaulted members of the public. Before police stormed the car, protesters had argued with a man wielding a hammer at the station, according to local media.Police said in a statement on Sunday that 40 people were arrested at Prince Edward station. It also said that two live rounds were fired on Saturday night - warning shots by two police officers who were surrounded by protesters trying to steal their pistols.Saturday’s clashes come after almost three months of mass protests, triggered by a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China. The demonstrations have plunged Hong Kong into its most serious political crisis in decades. The Hong Kong government, backed by Beijing, has ramped up their tactics on protesters who have also escalated their methods, throwing petrol bombs and bricks on Saturday.As helicopters hovered overhead, protesters clashed with police in various locations throughout the city as they took to the streets in defiance of a police ban and marked the anniversary of a decision by Beijing to limit democratic reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.Earlier in the day, thousands of protesters had surrounded government headquarters, shining lasers at the building, taunting police, and throwing objects into the complex.Police fired multiple rounds of tear gas from inside the compound, shrouding a six-lane traffic artery in gas while protesters threw the canisters back. The police also deployed water cannons, spraying protesters with blue dye, a method of marking them for later arrests.After retreating from the government complex, hundreds of protesters surrounded the police headquarters where they built a barricade of plastic barriers, traffic cones, and other debris across a road and set it alight, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky until firefighters put the blaze out.Clashes continued throughout the night as police in various locations chased protesters, pinning them to the ground to arrest them. Undercover police dressed as protesters were seen firing rounds of pepper spray on demonstrators, who attacked them with umbrellas. Police reportedly fired at least one live round in a warning shot outside Victoria Park.A march earlier in the day was peaceful, attended by families, middle-aged and elderly residents. The march had originally been called off by the organiser, Civil Human Rights Front, after police arrested prominent pro-democracy lawmakers and activists, including Joshua Wong, a student leader in the 2014 pro-democracy protests known as the umbrella movement.Demonstrators marched despite heavy rain, following parts of the original route. Jackie, a protester who had brought her mother to the march, said: “Our government hasn’t replied to any of our demands ... we are in a corner and we can’t do anything apart from coming out to the street every single weekend.”Critics have begun comparing footage of the police storming the train station to an episode in July, when dozens of masked men in Yuen Long, an outskirt of Hong Kong, beat commuters with rods – an incident that spurred more protests.Despite the arrests and harsher police tactics, protesters said they would continue to make their demands, which include the permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill.“If we stop now, only punishment awaits us,” said Sonny Lai, 21, a protester who was wearing plastic body armour, a gas mask and gloves and was holding boxing pads.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has hinted that a draconian emergency law could be enacted, giving the government sweeping powers to crack down on demonstrators.“They are trying to crack down on the movement as soon as possible, and they just don’t want to give any concessions to Hong Kong people,” said Lo Kin-hei, the vice-chair of the Democratic party.Observers believe Beijing is anxious to stop the protests before 1 October, which marks 70 years since the founding of the People’s Republic, a politically important anniversary.“If we don’t stand up now, it’s going to be too late,” said Simon Chang, a protester in Wan Chai, where earlier in the day hundreds had filled a sports stadium, holding posters featuring Lam with a bloodied eye – a reference to a protester who was seriously injured in one eye.Another protester, who asked not to give her name, said: “Even if they arrest more people, that won’t stop us. They keep arresting people, making us more angry. We will keep coming out.”According to recent reports, Beijing has ordered Lam not to concede to any of the protesters’ demands, including more politically feasible ones such as the permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill, which officials have already announced dead, or an independent inquiry into police behaviour toward protesters.Chan said he believed Beijing was holding Lam back because meeting any demands would “create a feeling that we are able to do something against the government”. He added: “And they don’t want this sentiment to spread.”Saturday marks five years since China handed down a proposal to introduce democratic elections in Hong Kong, as laid out in the basic law, the territory’s mini constitution, and promised by previous leaders.China’s proposal allowed for popular election of Hong Kong’s leader, the chief executive, but only among candidates chosen by an election committee dominated by pro-Beijing members. The proposal kicked off the umbrella movement, which paralysed parts of the city for 79 days.As police and protesters clashed in the early evening, the government said “rashly” implementing universal suffrage, one of the demands of the demonstrators this summer as well as in 2014, was “irresponsible” and would only “further polarise society”.“Any discussions on constitutional development have to be premised on the legal basis, and be conducted under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust,” it said in a statement.This summer’s demonstrations have now lasted longer than the umbrella movement, surprising both protesters and residents with its momentum. Protesters said the turnout on Saturday showed the movement was still going strong.“You can see a lot of Hong Kong people still coming out today.

their methods throwing petrol bombs and bricks on saturday as helicopters hovered overhead protesters clashed with police in various locations throughout the city as they took to the streets in defiance of a police ban and marked the anniversary of a decision by beijing to limit democratic reforms in the semi autonomous chinese territory earlier in the day thousands of protesters had surrounded government headquarters shining lasers at the building taunting police and throwing objects into the complex police fired multiple rounds of tear gas from inside the compound shrouding a six lane traffic artery in gas while protesters threw the canisters back the police also deployed water cannons spraying protesters with blue dye a method of marking them for later arrests after retreating from the government complex hundreds of protesters surrounded the police headquarters where they built a barricade of plastic barriers traffic cones and other debris across a road and set it alight sending plumes of black smoke into the sky until firefighters put the blaze out clashes continued throughout the night as police in various locations chased protesters pinning them to the ground to arrest them undercover police dressed as protesters were seen firing rounds of pepper spray on demonstrators who attacked them with umbrellas police reportedly fired at least one live round in a warning shot outside victoria park a march earlier in the day was peaceful attended by families middle aged and elderly residents the march had originally been called off by the organiser civil human rights front after police arrested prominent pro democracy lawmakers and activists including joshua wong a student leader in the  pro democracy protests known as the umbrella movement demonstrators marched despite heavy rain following parts of the original route jackie a protester who had brought her mother to the march said our government hasn t replied to any of our demands we are in a corner and we can t do anything apart from coming out to the street every single weekend critics have begun comparing footage of the police storming the train station to an episode in july when dozens of masked men in yuen long an outskirt of hong kong beat commuters with rods an incident that spurred more protests despite the arrests and harsher police tactics protesters said they would continue to make their demands which include the permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill if we stop now only punishment awaits us said sonny lai  a protester who was wearing plastic body armour a gas mask and gloves and was holding boxing pads hong kong s leader carrie lam has hinted that a draconian emergency law could be enacted giving the government sweeping powers to crack down on demonstrators they are trying to crack down on the movement as soon as possible and they just don t want to give any concessions to hong kong people said lo kin hei the vice chair of the democratic party observers believe beijing is anxious to stop the protests before  october which marks  years since the founding of the people s republic a politically important anniversary if we don t stand up now it s going to be too late said simon chang a protester in wan chai where earlier in the day hundreds had filled a sports stadium holding posters featuring lam with a bloodied eye a reference to a protester who was seriously injured in one eye another protester who asked not to give her name said even if they arrest more people that won t stop us they keep arresting people making us more angry we will keep coming out according to recent reports beijing has ordered lam not to concede to any of the protesters demands including more politically feasible ones such as the permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill which officials have already announced dead or an independent inquiry into police behaviour toward protesters chan said he believed beijing was holding lam back because meeting any demands would create a feeling that we are able to do something against the government he added and they don t want this sentiment to spread saturday marks five years since china handed down a proposal to introduce democratic elections in hong kong as laid out in the basic law the territory s mini constitution and promised by previous leaders china s proposal allowed for popular election of hong kong s leader the chief executive but only among candidates chosen by an election committee dominated by pro beijing members the proposal kicked off the umbrella movement which paralysed parts of the city for  days as police and protesters clashed in the early evening the government said rashly implementing universal suffrage one of the demands of the demonstrators this summer as well as in  was irresponsible and would only further polarise society any discussions on constitutional development have to be premised on the legal basis and be conducted under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust it said in a statement this summer s demonstrations have now lasted longer than the umbrella movement surprising both protesters and residents with its momentum protesters said the turnout on saturday showed the movement was still going strong you can see a lot of hong kong people still coming out today they are not afraid said elsa chu  who was protesting outside of the government headquarters hong kong people know that if we are afraid we will have nothing we will stay together to protest and protect our home she said ,Hong Kong Protests,0.320337504
"A peaceful rally in Hong Kong has descended into chaos as police fired teargas and water cannon at protesters who hurled petrol bombs, set fires and clashed with residents.Tens of thousands of demonstrators defied a police ban and marched on the seat of the government calling for greater democracy in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.Hundreds of protesters who splintered off from the march surrounded the government complex, throwing rocks and molotov cocktails, prompting riot police to respond with multiple rounds of teargas as well as water cannon that covered demonstrators in blue dye, meant to help identify protesters for arrest later.In a statement, the police said they deployed teargas, rubber bullets, sponge rounds and “crowd management vehicles” on demonstrators participating in an “unauthorised assembly”. It also said two police officers withdrew pistols at one point when they were attacked by around 20 protesters who hurled petrol bombs at them.The Hong Kong government issued a late night statement “severely condemning the violent acts which totally disregard law and order.”Skirmishes broke out in various locations across Hong Kong as protesters scattered after the police dispersal. In the residential area of Fortress Hill, men in white T-shirts beat people with rods and stools. Lam, a 30-year-old man who asked to only give his surname, was knocked to the ground and kicked repeatedly by a group of men.“I saw men rushing out of [metro] station with chairs to hit … they were doing the beating. I yelled, ‘someone is beating [people] and they rushed me … and beat me,” he said.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. Fights also broke out in the nearby neighbourhood of North Point, a pro-government district where dozens of local residents jeered at riot police who arrived at the scene to break up the fights. Pro-democracy lawmaker Ted Hui was arrested late night for obstructing police after he tried to persuade them to release a couple, reported public broadcaster RTHK. A university student reporter was also taken away by police for having a knife in his bag, even though he claimed it was for cutting moon cakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival the night before, RTHK said.Sunday’s clashes came after ugly scenes of brawls between anti-government and pro-Beijing demonstrators on Saturday, marking the 15th consecutive weekend of mass protests that have roiled Hong Kong for the last three months.Much of the demonstrations are centred on public anger toward the police as authorities crack down harder on protesters by force. More than 1,000 people have been arrested.“Please tell the world,” said Lo, 41, who lives in Fortress Hill, where bystanders yelled at the police to leave. “We are suffering. We are scared every day when the police come out.”The demonstrators, many of them young students, have also become more violent. On Sunday, they set fires outside a metro station and smashed glass windows and display cases inside the stations. Video footage posted online showed what appeared to be a group of black-clad demonstrators mobbing a man. In another, a group was seen beating up a young man.Crowds of demonstrators had marched earlier in the day, chanting “Resist Beijing, liberate Hong Kong”. Many held up their right hands in reference to the five demands of the protesters, which include an independent investigation into police behaviour.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said her government will formally withdraw the bill that ignited months of protests. Hong Kong residents had feared it could be used by China to extradite people for political reasons. They want guarantees that it cannot be reintroduced at a later date.Protesters want the government to officially recognise that their movement has been a series of legitimate protests, rather than a riot, as has been stated in official communications.Hundreds of people have been arrested in recent weeks, and the protesters are demanding that all of them be freed, and that no convictions should stand against any of them.Police use of force has escalated since the demonstrations began, while protesters have also resorted to increasingly violent measures. Demonstrators say an inquiry into police brutality is the number-one priority.Hong Kong's chief executive is currently selected by a 1,200-member committee, and nearly half of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by limited electorates representing different sectors of the economy. The protesters want to be able to vote for their leaders in free and open democratic elections. The protests mark Hong Kong’s – as well as Beijing’s – most serious political crisis in decades, triggered by a proposal to allow extradition to mainland China. As the protests have dragged on, confrontations between police and protesters have become increasingly violent.“If we fail this time, we will not have a second chance. Our civil society will be repressed by the Chinese Communist party. So we have to keep going,” said Gerald Chan, 24, a master’s student who was wearing reflective goggles and held a shield improvised from street signs.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said she will permanently withdraw the controversial bill but the demonstrations have expanded to take on new demands, including an independent investigation into the police and implementation of universal suffrage.“This is not the Hong Kong we know,” said Tim Cheng, 42, a father of two, who said the demand he most wanted to see met was the inquiry into police behaviour. “When I was young, my parents and teachers told me that if I was in trouble to contact the police. Now I can’t tell my kids that.”Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of pro-democracy protesters had gathered outside the British consulate in Hong Kong chanting “we will not surrender” as they called on the UK to come to the aid of the former British colony, handed over to Chinese control in 1997.Demonstrators waved the union flag, sang God Save the Queen and chanted “Stand for freedom, stand with Hong Kong”.China has called the handover agreement signed by the UK and China in 1997 – the joint declaration – a “historical document” with “no practical significance”.Chinese officials have lashed out at the UK for signalling its support of Hong Kong. A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman in June said the document was a “legally binding treaty … that remains as valid today as it was when it was signed”.Beijing and pro-China figures in Hong Kong have previously accused foreign powers including the US and the UK of secretly funding and organising the rallies.On Saturday, Joshua Wong, the democracy activist and former student leader of the 2014 umbrella movement in Hong Kong, called on US officials to include Hong Kong and a human rights clause in ongoing negotiations as the US and China try to resolve a long-running trade war and for lawmakers to pass legislation that could sanction Hong Kong officials.On Sunday, families, middle-aged and elderly residents, marched, chanting “Reclaim Hong Kong!” and held signs that said “Guard the next generation”.“We owe them a lot, they have sacrificed a lot. For us, just going out to the protests is the minimum we can do,” said Des, 50, a demonstrator who often comes to protests with his 11-year-old son.“This is our last chance. You can see the momentum. People are still coming out. We need to take this one last chance.”Additional reporting by Verna Yu",Police fire teargas and water cannon at Hong Kong protesters,2019-09-15/16:07:38,a peaceful rally in hong kong has descended

"Flight attendants and airport staff have begun a planned 11-hour protest at Hong Kong international airport to call on the government to account for a violent attack on residents by suspected gang members last week.The aviation staff were joined by demonstrators dressed in black, the signature colour of the Chinese territory’s protest movement, who filled the airport’s arrival hall on Friday. They sat on the ground chanting “Free Hong Kong” as shocked travellers walked through the terminal.Protesters held up signs designed to look like customs notices and played tongue-in-cheek audio messages resembling in-flight safety instructions.Here’s their protest video narrated like a tranquil in-flight announcement“Kindly put on your masks and black t-shirts when attending the assembly... Hongkongers will always stand in unity to fight for our rights and freedom. Thank you for flying with us, members of Hong Kong” pic.twitter.com/0pddnNyOT5Hong Kong has been gripped by nearly two months of demonstrations by residents calling for democratic reforms and the withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill. Clashes between protesters and police and other parties have become increasingly violent.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongFriday’s demonstration against the government and police, who have been accused of colluding with triads (organised crime groups) to suppress protests, was also aimed at urging international visitors to pay attention to Hong Kong.A group of students held signs in English, Japanese, and Korean calling on “international friends for help standing up to the Hong Kong government”. Many held signs in red and white, designed to look like warning flags raised by police before firing on demonstrators, which said: “Tourist warning: do not trust the police or the government.”Authorities are bracing for days of protests, as public anger towards the police and the government of the chief executive, Carrie Lam, reaches new heights. After an attack on commuters last Sunday by suspected organised crime groups left 45 people hospitalised, dozens of groups planned rallies and issued public petitions.On Saturday, demonstrators plan to rally in Yuen Long, in Hong Kong’s New Territories, where last week’s attack took place, in defiance of a police ban. Instead protesters are calling on residents to come “for a walk” or to “stimulate the Yuen Long economy”. Organisers have filed an appeal to overturn the police decision to bar the march.Protesters at the airport called out to mainland Chinese travellers to come to Yuen Long on Saturday for “major discounts” on makeup, branded goods, and milk powder, items popular with Chinese shoppers visiting Hong Kong.Hk protestors welcoming mainland travelers to Hong Kong advertising milk powder, makeup, and great deals on 7/27 in Yuen Long.

The public servants posted images of their government staff identity cards, as proof of their positions, with notes on them calling for an investigation into the police.On Friday, 77 conductors who work on the metro line where the attack in Yuen Long took place also threatened “further actions”. Medical students at a university and staff at a hospital also planned to stage demonstrations on Friday afternoon.Government efforts to tamp down the demonstrations have so far been ineffective. Lam last spoke to the public on Monday when she condemned the attack in Yuen Long but went on to criticise protesters for defacing the building of China’s representative office in protests last weekend.In a ruling likely to add to protesters grievances, Hong Kong’s appeal court on Friday overturned the conviction of two police officers previously found guilty of beating a protester in an alley during pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014.On Friday, Reuters reported that it had obtained a recording from an official from China’s representative office calling on residents in Yuen Long to drive away protesters. “We won’t allow them to come to Yuen Long to cause trouble,” Li Jiyi, the director of the central government liaison’s local district office said at a banquet for villagers in the New Territories, according to Reuters.Chinese officials have denied allegations it orchestrated or encouraged the attacks, with pro-Beijing figures in the Hong Kong government calling such reports “malicious rumours”.In a press briefing on Friday, the chief secretary for Hong Kong, Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, reminded demonstrators planning to go to Yuen Long that if their appeal was not accepted their actions would be illegal.He called on demonstrators to “peacefully and rationally” express themselves, to “stay away from violence” and “respect the life of the residents of Yuen Long”.",Hong

"Hong Kong protesters have shut down one of the world’s busiest airports in a dramatic escalation of the mass demonstrations that have plunged the city into its worst political crisis in decades.The unprecedented cancellation of all flights followed the fourth consecutive day of protests at the airport and amid increasingly threatening statements from Beijing. A Chinese official said “terrorism” was emerging in the city, while in Hong Kong authorities demonstrated water cannon for use in crowd control.The protests are in their 10th week, with confrontations between protesters and police growing more violent. Rights groups and democracy activists have accused police of using increasingly excessive force. At least 40 people were treated in hospital after clashes on Sunday, including a woman who was hit, reportedly with a beanbag round, and could potentially lose an eye.Protesters in black T-shirts and face masks filled the airport, handing out lists to arriving visitors documenting alleged police violence and holding up graphic images of injured protesters. Some held signs that said: “An eye for an eye” and wore eye patches in solidarity with the injured woman.Others held posters that said: “Hong Kong is not safe” and “Shame on police” and chanted: “Stand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom!” “I just don’t understand how people can tolerate that kind of police brutality. I feel like if I don’t come out now, I can’t come out ever,” said Hilary Lo, who took a half day’s sick leave from her accountancy firm to attend the demonstration.“People are starting to realise the police are out of control, especially with what has happened in the past two weeks,” she said.Tourists remained at the airport through the protest, with flights expected to resume at 6am on Tuesday. Elodichukwu Obiageli, from Nigeria, said she had been stranded for five hours. “We had no information from our airline. We are just stranded here – we have no money,” she said, adding that all airport stores had closed.By the early evening, crowds had thinned amid reports police would move in to clear the airport but when they did not show, thousands of protesters streamed back, bringing supplies to stay through the night.“Honestly, I don’t think anything will happen,” said Andy Chu, a protester who remained at the airport. “I think the police strategy until now we can see is to burn out our energy, just let us sit here and wait.”“A few hours ago there were rumours flying around, saying the police are coming in to kick us out, with teargas,” he said. “I think that is also from the police. That’s part of their tactics, part of the game. They want most of the more peaceful protesters to leave themselves.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongHong Kong’s summer of dissent has presented one of the biggest challenges to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, since he came to power in 2012. Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council called on authorities to “show no mercy” in dealing with the protesters.“Hong Kong’s radical demonstrators have repeatedly used extremely dangerous tools to attack police officers, which already constitutes a serious violent crime, and also shows the first signs of terrorism emerging,” Yang said at a press briefing. “This wantonly tramples on Hong Kong’s rule of law and social order.”State-backed media in China on Monday said armed police had held exercises in the neighbouring city of Shenzhen.In an apparent warning to protesters of a toughening approach on the part of authorities, Hong Kong police invited legislators and journalists on Monday to witness a display of water cannon. Police have never used the device since two were bought after pro-democracy protests in 2014, but during Monday’s demonstration one was blasted at dummy targets in a training facility. Man-Kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International’s Hong Kong division, warned that clashes between protesters and police had “escalated to another level, especially on the police side” over the weekend.Tam cited footage of police firing teargas into a subway station in Kwai Fong on Sunday night. It was not clear how many protesters were in the station but it was rare for officers to fire teargas indoors. He also shared a video of police firing non-lethal projectiles at close range as protesters attempted to flee down an escalator at another subway station.The police have also reported injuries among their ranks, including eye irritation from laser pointers and petrol bomb burns.Civil Rights Observer, a local rights group that sends observers to protests, said it had serious concerns about police violence and had seen “clear evidence to show the police are violating their guidelines”, according to its spokesman, Icarus Wong Ho-yin.During the protests at the weekend, the Hong Kong Free Press news website posted footage of one arrest that appeared to show officers dressed as protesters pressing a demonstrator to the ground. The young man, who said his name was Chow Ka-lok and asked for a lawyer, sustained head wounds and a broken tooth.Protests in Hong Kong began in early June against a legislative bill that would have allowed for residents to stand trial in mainland China on criminal charges. While the territory returned to Chinese rule in 1997, it was promised semi-autonomy for 50 years including a separate legal system. Many protesters feared the bill, now suspended, would have led to the decline of civil and political rights in the Asian financial hub.",Hong Kong airport authority cancels flights over

"Pro-Hong Kong and pro-China students have clashed at the University of Queensland during a protest against Hong Kong’s controversial extradition law.The protest, organised by Hong Kong international students to coincide with the university’s market day, turned violent when it was interrupted by other students.Nilsson Jones, an editor of the university’s student magazine Semper Floreat, told Guardian Australia pro-Chinese students ripped up signs supporting Hong Kong and protesting against the Chinese state’s treatment of its Uighur population.“There were signs saying ‘One million Muslims detained, ‘Free Hong Kong’ and things like that. Tensions escalated when Chinese students arrived – there were students holding speakers and blasting the Chinese national anthem.“Things escalated and turned violent when pro-Chinese students started ripping up signs that the protesters were holding.”Jones captured footage of two students punching and shoving each other on the university’s Brisbane campus.Tensions escalated halfway through the protests #uqprotest #china #hongkong #uq pic.twitter.com/RWKmhwyCsTChinese students clash with pro-Hong Kong protesters at UQ after peaceful sit in #uq #hongkong #china pic.twitter.com/3hvRRyAHEIJones estimated there were 50 Hong Kong international students and 100 or more domestic students in the original protest, opposed by 200 or more counter-protesters.The University of Queensland said campus security called police to the scene.“One of the roles of universities is to enable open, respectful and lawful free speech, including debate about ideas we may not all support or agree with,” the university said in a statement.“The university expects staff and students to express their views in a lawful and respectful manner … Earlier today, in response to safety concerns resulting from a student-initiated protest on campus, the university requested police support.“On the advice of police, protestors were requested to move on.

"Hong Kong police say they arrested dozens of people, including a 12-year-old child, over the weekend, as they defended firing a live round for the first time since pro-democracy demonstrations started in June.Police said they detained 86 people for offences including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons and assaulting police officers.Sunday’s protests were the scene of the fiercest clashes yet between police and demonstrators since violence escalated in mid-June over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong people to be sent to mainland China for trial.Police fired water cannon and teargas in running battles with protesters, who threw bricks. Six officers drew their pistols and one officer fired a warning shot into the air, police said in a statement.Mak Chin-ho, an assistant police commissioner, said police had used force in response to violence by demonstrators.“We have seen an increase in the intensity and extensiveness of violence used by protesters. Their radical acts have intensified with more dangers and sometimes deadly weapons used including bricks, metal posts, long sticks, and petrol bombs,” said Mak.Hong Kong’s government also condemned the protesters. “The escalating illegal and violent acts of radical protesters are not only outrageous, they also push Hong Kong to the verge of a very dangerous situation.” It said police would “strictly follow up” on illegal acts.“Police will take relentless enforcement action to bring the persons involved to justice,” it said.Pro-democracy members of the Hong Kong’s legislative council countered that the government and the police need to take responsibility, the former for introducing the extradition legislation that sparked the protests and the latter for what they say is selective enforcement of the law targeting government opponents.Kwok Ka-ki, a member of the Civic party, blamed the Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam. He called her creation of a platform for dialogue a delay tactic rather than an attempt to resolve the conflict.“She is the one who should shoulder all the responsibility, and now she is trying to get away from all the responsibility and shifting the focus to the so-called platform,” he said.Clashes broke out after hundreds of thousands of people braved rain on Sunday to stage a peaceful, police-sanctioned march in Tsuen Wan, a part of the city noted for its links with triad members.The scenes of worsening unrest provoked anger in China, where the microblog of the Communist party’s mouthpiece, the People’s Daily newspaper, condemned protesters who removed a national flag at the rally before the march and trampled on it. “Such provocation challenges the national dignity and hurt the feelings of 1.4 billion Chinese … It should pay a cost.”The Hong Kong government said the act challenged the national authority and “allegedly violates” the national flag and national emblem ordinance.The government-aligned Global Times, meanwhile, hit out at western media for its “biased” coverage of the protests, particularly accounts of how the Hong Kong police officer fired a warning shot.The news outlet said “biased coverage had put the Hong Kong police in a dangerous position, as stories about police brutality have surfaced in recent weeks. Without considering facts, some Hong Kong reporters have stood by the anti-government protesters, abandoning the fundamentals of neutral and justified reporting”.Some protesters said they were resorting to violence because the government had not responded to their peaceful demonstrations.“The more the government ignores us, the more we have to come out,” said Peggy Tai, who is in her 60s, earlier in the day.After almost three months of continuous protests, demonstrators remained determined in their fight for political rights. The wave of protests, which started in early June in opposition to an extradition bill under which individuals could be sent to mainland China for trial, has morphed into a broader anti-government, pro-democracy movement.Demonstrators have five demands: the complete withdrawal of the now-suspended extradition bill; the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence; a halt to the characterisation of protests as “riots”; an amnesty for those arrested; and a resumption of political reform to allow the free election of Hong Kong’s leader and legislature.Lam said last week she would establish platforms for dialogue although protesters dismissed her offer and said she needed to respond to their demands.",Hong Kong police defend firing live round during latest protests,2019-08-26/16:24:01,hong kong police say they arrested dozens of people including a  year old child over the weekend as they defended firing a live round for the first time since pro democracy demonstrations started in june police said they detained  people for offences including unlawful assembly possession of offensive weapons and assaulting police officers sunday s protests were the scene of the fiercest clashes yet between police and demonstrators since violence escalated in mid june over a now suspended extradition bill that would have allowed hong kong people to be sent to mainland china for trial police fired water cannon and teargas in running battles with protesters who threw bricks six officers drew their pistols and one officer fired a warning shot into the air police said in a statement mak chin ho an assistant police commissioner said police had used force in response to violence by demonstrators we have seen an increase in the intensity and extensiveness of violence used by protesters their radical acts have intensified with more dangers and sometimes deadly weapons used including bricks metal posts long sticks and petrol bombs said mak hong kong s government also condemned the protesters the escalating illegal and violent acts of radical protesters are not only outrageous they also push hong kong to the verge of a very dangerous situation it said police would strictly follow up on illegal acts police will take relentless enforcement action to bring the persons involved to justice it said pro democracy members of the hong kong s legislative council countered that the government and the police need to take responsibility the former for introducing the extradition legislation that sparked the protests and the latter for what they say is selective enforcement of the law targeting government opponents kwok ka ki a member of the civic party blamed the hong kong leader carrie lam he called her creation of a platform for dialogue a delay tactic rather than an attempt to resolve the conflict she is the one who should shoulder all the responsibility and now she is trying to get away from all the responsibility and shifting the focus to the so called platform he said clashes broke out after hundreds of thousands of people braved rain on sunday to stage a peaceful police sanctioned march in tsuen wan a part of the city noted for its links with triad members the scenes of worsening unrest provoked anger in china where the microblog of the communist party s mouthpiece the people s daily newspaper condemned protesters who removed a national flag at the rally before the march and trampled on it such provocation challenges the national dignity and hurt the feelings of   billion chinese it should pay a cost the hong kong government said the act challenged the national authority and allegedly violates the national flag and national emblem ordinance the government aligned global times meanwhile hit out at western media for its biased coverage of the protests particularly accounts of how the hong kong police officer fired a warning shot the news outlet said biased coverage had put the hong kong police in a dangerous position as stories about police brutality have surfaced in recent weeks without considering facts some hong kong reporters have stood by the anti government protesters abandoning the fundamentals of neutral and justified reporting some protesters said they were resorting to violence because the government had not responded to their peaceful demonstrations the more the government ignores us the more we have to come out said peggy tai who is in her s earlier in the day after almost three months of continuous protests demonstrators remained determined in their fight for political rights the wave of protests which started in early june in opposition to an extradition bill under which individuals could be sent to mainland china for trial has morphed into a broader anti government pro democracy movement demonstrators have five demands the complete withdrawal of the now suspended extradition bill the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence a halt to the characterisation of protests as riots an amnesty for those arrested and a resumption of political reform to allow the free election of hong kong s leader and legislature lam said last week she would establish platforms for dialogue although protesters dismissed her offer and said she needed to respond to their demands ,Hong Kong Protests,0.314969718
"Hong Kong is braced for another round of demonstrations after the government failed to respond to a list of protester demands including an investigation into police brutality and the withdrawal of an extradition bill by a Thursday afternoon deadline.After cut-off set by protest leaders passed without word from the government, messages began circulating on social media calling people to come to central Hong Kong from 7am on Friday.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong“No response – no retreat,” read one. It called on people to “picnic, sing, stroll, watch the turtles and keep [out of] the rain”, phrases used as thinly veiled calls to political action because the planned demonstration does not have police approval.The city has been electrified by a series of mass protests – two peaceful Sunday marches on successive weekends and one unauthorised midweek demonstration that turned violent.People turned out in huge numbers because of concerns that the city’s economy and society would be fatally damaged by the extradition law, which would allow authorities to send both visitors and residents for trial in China’s opaque, sometimes brutal judicial system.The large turnout forced the Hong Kong chief executive, Carrie Lam, to publicly apologise and suspend the law she had once promised to ram through the island’s legislature.In a further apparent concession, the president of the legislature, Andrew Leung called for a delay to another controversial draft law, which would criminalise “insulting” the Chinese national anthem. Hong Kong sports fans have regularly booed when it is played at matches, as a form of protest.At a press conference on Wednesday, Lam hinted that the bill had been effectively abandoned but refused withdraw it, perhaps hoping to stave off further humiliation.Opposition figures say they do not trust Lam and want the bill neutralised. They fear she could take it up again in future once some of the public anger has dissipated. Many have called for her resignation.They also want an investigation into police use of force, the end of a crackdown on activists and for authorities to drop charges of rioting, which carry heavy sentences, against five people they have arrested.“We are concerned, we feel the youth have been cornered by the government,” said Ho Chi Kwan, an academic, who was particularly worried about arrests and rioting charges. “What they are demanding is what all the people of Hong Kong demand.”Ho was part of a small crowd of opposition activists who waited out the deadline in the sweltering heat outside government offices. They included student unions, church groups, scholars concerned about academic freedoms and Hong Kong parents who mobilised against police violence. After the deadline passed without response, and as work and school finished, the crowds swelled slightly, but a much larger turnout is expected on Friday.A similar last-minute protest on Wednesday last week turned violent, and there were fears there could be further unrest on Friday. “The students are still committed to a path of non-violent struggle, but who knows what the government will do,” said Ho.The Hong Kong Journalists Association said it would be offering free protective gear for reporters covering the protests, including gas masks. It had not offered that for Sunday’s march.Emily Lau, a veteran politician, was among many voices warning the protesters against violence, saying this would quickly lose them vital international support and was doomed to fail.“Can you be more violent than the police or People’s Liberation Army?” she said, adding that the only escalation she favoured was of peaceful protest numbers.Hong Kong’s next mass march is likely to be on 1 July, a national holiday to mark the city’s handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.There is a regular pro-democracy protest on that day, organised by the Civil Human Rights Front, which has also helped coordinate the last two Sunday marches. The group said it would support any peaceful protest before 1 July but its own efforts were focused on that day’s march.

"Hong Kong has once more descended into violence, with police firing teargas at protesters across the city as mass demonstrations calling for democracy entered their 10th consecutive week.Clashes with police were particularly intense on Sunday night compared with previous days, as riot police fired teargas into a railway station to disperse crowds and were captured on film beating protesters with batons as they fled down an escalator in another station.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongOther protesters were injured as undercover riot police turned on a crowd in Causeway Bay and began to arrest people, while widely circulated photos on social media showed one woman bleeding profusely from her eye after she was hit by police fire at another demonstration. Police also suffered casualties, according to authorities.It came as Cathay Pacific bowed to pressure from China, sacking two ground crew and suspending a pilot for “misconduct” in supporting the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests.The Hong Kong flag carrier airline, whose biggest shareholder is the Swire Group, chaired by the British billionaire Barnaby Swire, said it had fired two ground staff members for allegedly leaking the travel arrangements for a Hong Kong police football team travelling to the mainland for a tournament.The company said it was “aware of the inappropriate behaviour of an employee involving the misuse of company information” after a Cathay employee was accused by the Chinese state of posting details of the Hong Kong police officers travelling on the airline. The airline also said it had suspended a pilot who took part in pro-democracy protests, and faces charges for rioting. Cathay said the pilot was removed from flying duties on 30 July.Cathay said it would also comply with a directive from Beijing banning all staff who support the protests from working on flights to the mainland or through its airspace. China’s aviation regulator has ordered the airline to hand over identifying information for staff on mainland-bound flights effective immediately.The airline told all staff that it viewed the demonstrations as “illegal protests”, and if they took part they would be banned from flights. “Cathay Pacific Group’s operations in mainland China are key to our business. In addition to flying in and out of mainland China, a large number of our routes both to Europe and to the USA also fly through mainland China airspace,” its chief executive, Rupert Hogg, said.The luxury fashion label Versace and its artistic director, Donatella Versace, apologised to China after one of its T-shirts was criticised for identifying the semi-autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau as countries.On a tumultuous day in the city, protesters dressed in protective masks and goggles with long-sleeved shirts and trousers to protect them from teargas moved back and forth across the city’s subway system as police pushed crowds from one neighbourhood to the next. Chants such as “Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time” rang out as demonstrators filed into escalators alongside commuters and baffled tourists.“They sacrifice themselves,” an admiring bystander said as groups of young protesters crowded into his subway carriage bound for the Kowloon peninsula to reinforce a police-protester standoff. “What they gain is for [all of] us.”At Kwai Fong station, police fired teargas to disperse crowds. Earlier, they used batons to try to stop protesters.Police said one officer had been injured by a petrol bomb hurled by a protester in Tsim Sha Tsui and that bricks had also been hurled at officers.While many in Hong Kong appear to support the protesters, including ordinary people who have shown up in their hundreds of thousands at peaceful marches this summer, its chief executive, Carrie Lam, has maintained that protesters are largely violent fringe elements who have taken advantage of a civil disobedience movement.Beijing has also signalled that it is losing patience with the protests. Its Hong Kong affairs department has spoken to the media twice in recent weeks to warn protesters that their actions will not be tolerated.Protests began in Hong Kong in early June when Lam attempted to push through a legislative bill that would have allowed for residents to appear before criminal courts in mainland China. Many residents saw the bill as a wedge issue that would lead to their loss of civil and political rights, promised until 2047 under the “one country, two systems” agreement.The bill prompted the largest demonstrations since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, but Lam has steadfastly refused to meet any demands beyond a promise that the bill is now “suspended”.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. Many of its detractors, including a number of retirees and families, returned to Victoria Park in the thousands on Sunday afternoon for an assembly against the bill and to repeat their oft-heard demands that Lam withdraw it permanently and step down.At about 5pm, many pushed out of the park despite a police ban and into the shopping district of Causeway Bay and down Hennessy Road where they gathered close to police headquarters.“We are aware of what will happen,” a protester, Cherry Tsang, said as she prepared to leave Victoria Park, “but I think it is actually freedom of speech.”Ting Wai Fong, a retiree, said she was determined to keep coming to protests and march through the city to support the young generation.She said protesters now faced the dual terror of arrest and imprisonment as well as mobs of pro-China supporters, who attacked journalists including a reporter with the public broadcaster RTHK on Sunday and clashed with protesters the previous week. “If we are afraid, if we are not coming out to rally, we are encouraging these people to spread the terror,” she said.As thousands brought traffic to a standstill on Hong Kong island, a smaller simultaneous demonstration at Sham Shui Po in Kowloon was the first to be hit with police teargas.Similar standoffs followed near police headquarters before the mostly young protesters decamped en masse for the Kowloon peninsula where many had already barricaded an important cross-harbour tunnel.Protests looked likely to continue well into the night with police stationed at a number of subway exits across the city in apparent preparation to tackle new flashmob protest tactics.",Hong Kong hit by more violence as protests enter 10th week,2019-08-11/18:50:31,hong kong has once more descended into violence with police firing teargas at protesters across the city as

"Over the last few weeks, protesters in Hong Kong have taken to spraypainting traffic barriers, bridges, police stations and more with the words: “If we burn, you burn with us.”On Monday, much of the city burned under clouds of teargas, hails of rubber bullets, and fires lit by angry protesters facing off against riot police. Protesters and a group of men brawled on the street, hitting each other with wooden rods and traffic cones. In another neighbourhood, two people were knifed. Three cars rammed through crowds of protesters, injuring one person.After nine weeks of protests, demonstrators and the local government, backed by Beijing, find themselves in a stalemate where the possibility of a peaceful resolution has become more and more unlikely.The protests, triggered by an extradition bill that would send suspects to mainland China, have gained momentum and taken on new demands after weeks of clashes with police.The government under the chief executive, Carrie Lam, has held fast to its position that the protesters are rioters and deployed the city’s police force to deal with weekly protests that regularly devolve into clashes. Police have used teargas in 13 of Hong Kong’s 18 districts and more than 500 people have been arrested.Protesters, incensed by the police tactics and the government’s continued lack of response, are undeterred by such increasingly harsh measures. Some are adopting more extreme, violent tactics – taunting the police, defacing emblems of China’s sovereignty over Hong Kong, throwing bricks and petrol bombs.Protesters call it the “scorched earth” policy, that in order to compel authorities to pay attention a price must be paid – whether that is in the form of heavy criminal charges, getting repeatedly hit by teargas, or damaged job prospects if the Hong Kong economy suffers from political unrest.“I don’t think the government is willing to give ground and there’s no indication that the protesters are willing to settle,” said Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Australia.Ni believes the protests will continue to escalate, growing more violent, until another inflection point is reached – probably the death or serious injury of a protester, police officer or bystander.“Without the government giving in to demands of the people on the street, I don’t see that the protests will end peacefully,” he said.As political unrest continues, the possibility that Beijing could intervene looms larger. Chinese and Hong Kong officials have repeatedly denied plans to deploy the People’s Liberation Army, which has a garrison in Hong Kong – a scenario that would be reminiscent of the violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, in 1989.Yet, China has released two promotional videos showing Chinese military and police battling residents in black, the signature colour of the protesters. A senior military official recently referred to the part of Hong Kong’s garrison law which says the PLA can intervene to “maintain public order” if Hong Kong requests it.Observers say sending in troops or taking over the governing of Hong Kong directly is an extreme last resort. “That would have huge costs to the mainland government, to the Hong Kong government,” said John Burns, a professor emeritus at Hong Kong University focusing on Hong Kong.“All of this would be put under tight party control and then you have people in Hong Kong still with their ideas, seething under this kind of military occupation. Is that the way to go?”Not all protesters appear concerned about the possibility of the PLA entering their streets, knowing it would hurt Beijing as much as Hong Kong.“We are not afraid. If the Chinese army comes out, we will celebrate,” said one protester.Others say Hong Kong authorities, under pressure from China to take a harder line on protesters, can turn to methods used before. After a wave of pro-democracy protests in 2014 known as the Umbrella movement, the government disqualified pro-democracy lawmakers and jailed leaders of the movement.Yet it’s not clear those measures worked, given the resurgence of mass protests this summer. “When resistance came back, it came back with a vengeance,” said Victoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at Notre Dame University.Many protesters are not optimistic. Jason Keung, a lanky 22-year old in glasses, trainers and a surgical mask, was sitting alone on a kerb, mentally preparing to do battle with the police. He says he tries not to focus on how things will end.“I don’t think about the future because I just want to live in the now,” he said. “Hong Kong is controlled by China, yes. I don’t think we can fight them but we have to try. We don’t have any choice but to fight.”",Hong Kong’s peace prospects recede amid teargas and smoke,2019-08-06/17:05:09,over the last few weeks protesters in hong kong have taken to spraypainting traffic barriers bridges police stations and more with the words if we burn you burn with us on monday much of the city burned under clouds of teargas hails of rubber bullets and fires lit by angry protesters facing off against riot police protesters and a group of men brawled on the street hitting each other with wooden rods and traffic cones in another neighbourhood two people were knifed three cars rammed through crowds of protesters injuring one person after nine weeks of protests demonstrators and the local government backed by beijing find themselves in a stalemate where the possibility of a peaceful resolution has become more and more unlikely the protests triggered by an extradition bill that would send suspects to mainland china have gained momentum and taken on new demands after weeks of clashes with police the government under the chief executive carrie lam has held fast to its position that the protesters are rioters and deployed the city s police force to deal with weekly protests that regularly devolve into clashes police have used teargas in  of hong kong s  districts and more than  people have been arrested protesters incensed by the police tactics and the government s continued lack of response are undeterred by such increasingly harsh measures some are adopting more extreme violent tactics taunting the police defacing emblems of china s sovereignty over hong kong throwing bricks and petrol bombs protesters call it the scorched earth policy that in order to compel authorities to pay attention a price must be paid whether that is in the form of heavy criminal charges getting repeatedly hit by teargas or damaged job prospects if the hong kong economy suffers from political unrest i don t think the government is willing to give ground and there s no indication that the protesters are willing to settle said adam ni a china researcher at macquarie university in australia ni believes the protests will continue to escalate growing more violent until another inflection point is reached probably the death or serious injury of a protester police officer or bystander without the government giving in to demands of the people on the street i don t see that the protests will end peacefully he said as political unrest continues the possibility that beijing could intervene looms larger chinese and hong kong officials have repeatedly denied plans to deploy the people s liberation army which has a garrison in hong kong a scenario that would be reminiscent of the violent crackdown on pro democracy demonstrators in tiananmen square beijing in  yet china has released two promotional videos showing chinese military and police battling residents in black the signature colour of the protesters a senior military official recently referred to the part of hong kong s garrison law which says the pla can intervene to maintain public order if hong kong requests it observers say sending in troops or taking over the governing of hong kong directly is an extreme last resort that would have huge costs to the mainland government to the hong kong government said john burns a professor emeritus at hong kong university focusing on hong kong all of this would be put under tight party control and then you have people in hong kong still with their ideas seething under this kind of military occupation is that the way to go not all protesters appear concerned about the possibility of the pla entering their streets knowing it would hurt beijing as much as hong kong we are not afraid if the chinese army comes out we will celebrate said one protester others say hong kong authorities under pressure from china to take a harder line on protesters can turn to methods used before after a wave of pro democracy protests in  known as the umbrella movement the government disqualified pro democracy lawmakers and jailed leaders of the movement yet it s not clear those measures worked given the resurgence of mass protests this summer when resistance came back it came back with a vengeance said victoria hui an associate professor of political science at notre dame university many protesters are not optimistic jason keung a lanky  year old in glasses trainers and a surgical mask was sitting alone on a kerb mentally preparing to do battle with the police he says he tries not to focus on how things will end i don t think about the future because i just want to live in the now he said hong kong is controlled by china yes i don t think we can fight them but we have to try we don t have any choice but to fight ,Hong Kong Protests,0.308197349
"Crowds clashed with police across Hong Kong in the fourth day of protests against an anti-mask law that the government claimed was needed to stop violence but critics say is a dangerous assault on civil rights.Hong Kong authorities brought the first charges under a new anti-mask law earlier on Monday, as the city slowly recovered from a weekend of protests against the ban that turned violent, leaving a trail of destruction and shuttered metro stations.The government insisted the prohibition – unveiled on Friday and brought into effect overnight using sweeping colonial-era powers – was needed to end four months of protests, but instead it has only inflamed tensions across the city.Later riot police used tear gas on protestors in at least three areas and also arrested demonstrators in several other parts of the city.In Kowloon, police fires several rounds of tear gas, and played cat and mouse up and down Nathan Road with protestors shouting insults and protest slogans.A new Hong Kong extradition law is proposed, which would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for a variety of crimes. Residents fear it could lead to politically motivated extraditions into China's much harsher judicial system.Large public demonstrations start as thousands march in the streets to protest against the extradition bill.Hong Kong lawmakers scuffle in parliament during a row over the law.Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences, but critics say they are not enough.The scale of protests continues to increase as more than half a million people take to the streets. Police use rubber bullets and teargas against the biggest protests Hong Kong has seen for decades.Lam says the proposed extradition law has been postponed indefinitely.The protests continue as demonstrators storm the Legislative Council, destroying pictures, daubing graffiti on the walls and flying the old flag of Hong Kong emblazoned with the British union flag. The protests coincide with the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the UK back to China.Armed men in white T-shirts thought to be supporting the Chinese government attack passengers and passers-by in Yuen Long metro station, while nearby police take no action.44 protesters are charged with rioting, which further antagonises the anti-extradition bill movement.By now the protest movement has coalesced around five key demands: complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, withdrawal of the use of the word ""riot"" in relation to the protests, unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped, an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of genuine universal suffrage.The mass protests enter their fifteenth week, with police resorting to teargas and water cannon against the demonstrators, and a wave of ""doxxing"" using digital techniques to unmask police and protesters as a new front in the battle.Police shoot a protester with live ammunition for the first time, as demonstrations continue on the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People's Republic of China.The first charges are brought against protesters for covering their faces, after authorities bring in new laws banning face masks in order to make it easier to identify or detain protesters.Hong Kong officials spark outrage in the city as it revealed that nearly a third of protesters arrested since June have been children. Seven hundred and 50 out of the 2,379 people arrested  were under 18, and 104 were under 16.Lam is forced to deliver a key annual policy speech via video link after after being heckled in parliament, as the legislative council resumed sessions after it was suspended on 12 June. Later in the day one of the protest leaders, Jimmy Sham, was attacked by assailants wielding hammers and knives.Chan Tong-kai, the murder suspect whose case prompted the original extradition bill is released from prison, saying that he is willing to surrender himself to Taiwan. The extradition bill is also formally withdrawn, a key demand of protesters.“At this stage we don’t feel any hope,” said one demonstrator, who asked not to be named. “We can’t do anything against the police, and obviously the laws no longer work here. Still every time I think of the other protestors who have been injured or arrested, I feel we have no right to give up.”A man and a woman arrested on Sunday evening were charged with illegally covering their faces on Monday morning, the first time the law has been used; the courtroom was filled with many supporters who were wearing face masks themselves.The mask ban was brought in under the colonial-era emergency regulations ordinance, which gives Chief Executive Carrie Lam virtually unlimited power.The emergency powers have not been used for over half a century, and never since the handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Critics say that their use is unjustified, and a first step towards authoritarianism. Lam has hinted that she might use it to roll out harsher measures including a curfew if protests continue.Parts of the city’s metro was shut down on Monday, a public holiday in Hong Kong, after stations were damaged. Protesters are angry both that authorities have started closing parts of the MTR network prevent people gathering for protests or dispersing afterwards, and also that police have attacked protesters in stations.Authorities said the entire network will shut four hours early at 6pm, to allow for repairs. With more protests planned for the evening, that will also make it harder for demonstrators to cross the city.There is also widespread popular anger at police pursuing protestors through public spaces including shopping centres and train stations. A video shared on Twitter showed guards in one shopping mall desperately trying to hold the doors closed against police, who eventually burst through.Hong Kong’s last governor Chris Patten joined attacks on Lam for her government’s heavy-handed approach, warning that the situation was likely to escalate further unless she started negotiations with protesters.“The way forward is to engage with the demonstrators, particularly the peaceful demonstrators,” he told Sky news, highlighting two incidents in which teenagers were seriously injured by armed police.“Before long, unless we’re very, very lucky, people are going to get killed, people are going to get shot. The idea that with public order policing, you send police forces out with live bullets, with live ammunition, is preposterous,”Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said her government will formally withdraw the bill that ignited months of protests. Hong Kong residents had feared it could be used by China to extradite people for political reasons. They want guarantees that it cannot be reintroduced at a later date.Protesters want the government to officially recognise that their movement has been a series of legitimate protests, rather than a riot, as has been stated in official communications.Hundreds of people have been arrested in recent weeks, and the protesters are demanding that all of them be freed, and that no convictions should stand against any of them.Police use of force has escalated since the demonstrations began, while protesters have also resorted to increasingly violent measures. Demonstrators say an inquiry into police brutality is the number-one priority.Hong Kong's chief executive is currently selected by a 1,200-member committee, and nearly half of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by limited electorates representing different sectors of the economy. The protesters want to be able to vote for their leaders in free and open democratic elections. China’s Hong Kong military garrison also warned protesters on Sunday they could be arrested for targeting its barracks with laser lights, the first direct interaction between the People’s Liberation Army and demonstrators.Adding to concerns about a crack down on civil liberties, the city’s education bureau has also told schools they must provide details of how many students boycott classes, wear masks for political reasons, or take part in other protest activities, the South China Morning Post reported.A Whatsapp message asked for the information by 11am on Tuesday, and also asked principals to take note of any “special incidents”, and record any students taking “abnormal leave”. Lawmaker and vice-president of the Professional Teachers’ Union Ip Kin-yuen attacked the “totally unnecessary” directive.“What does the bureau really want to achieve by collecting such figures?” he told the paper. “And what if some of the non-cooperation movements happened solely outside school, should these events be reported as well?”There were also fresh attacks on media freedoms Sunday, with police beating up one reporter and forcing another to remove his gas mask, even though the law protects the right to be masked for professional reasons.

"Hong Kong protesters have clashed with police and fought off a group of men armed with poles as the city’s political unrest continues.A citywide strike accompanied by rallies in seven districts descended into chaos on Monday evening as thousands of protesters fanned out across the city, occupying roads, disrupting traffic, and vandalising police stations and other public buildings.Riot police fired teargas, rubber bullets, sponge grenades and pepper spray on protesters in at least seven locations, including a main area near the government headquarters. Residential neighbourhoods were shrouded with clouds of teargas and residents were seen yelling at police or hurrying away.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongIn a predominately pro-Beijing neighbourhood, North Point, a group of men armed with wooden rods began beating protesters, in scenes reminiscent of an attack on commuters last month in Yuen Long by suspected gang members.One witness, a 33-year-old hotel employee who only wanted to give his surname, Cheung, said a group of about 20 men with wooden rods, some in white T-shirts, had approached the protesters. “Both sides were shouting at each other and they rushed toward us and beat us … hitting with wooden rods and eventually their fists,” he said.Earlier in the day, two taxis and a private car drove through crowds of protesters who had set up roadblocks, injuring at least one person. In Sha Tin, in Hong Kong’s New Territories, protesters grabbed bricks they had dug up and chased after a taxi that had narrowly missed running over demonstrators.In a statement on Monday evening, the police condemned the “violent acts in various locations” and said they were using minimal force to disperse protesters.Protesters threw bricks, shattering windows of a police dormitory in Wong Tai Sin, a working-class district that has been the site of serious clashes between police and residents and protesters for the last three nights. One group attempted to break down the gate to the compound while others shone lasers into the building.“The government is ignoring us. You might say what we are doing is violent, but I think it’s time the government pays attention to us,” said Herry Tsui, 25, from Wong Tai Sin. “They are so angry and keep firing teargas at us. We are just trying to protect where we live.” It is the ninth week of consecutive mass protests in Hong Kong, which is facing its most serious political crisis since the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997.The protests, initially over an extradition bill to send suspects to China, have turned into a broader political movement for the semi-autonomous city. Protesters and other supporters are demanding the protection of freedoms promised under the terms of the handover, a policy known as “one country, two systems”, as well as accountability from the Hong Kong government, which ultimately answers to Beijing.In recent weeks, the movement has been fuelled by anger at the police for their tactics towards young protesters, often armed with just umbrellas, walking sticks and makeshift shields. Authorities appear to be taking harsher measures after protesters shifted their tactics by using guerrilla-style “flashmob” protests to evade capture by the police.The police had detained 82 people by the early evening, bringing the total number of arrests since protests began in June to more than 500. Police said the youngest person arrested was 13 and the oldest 76. Last week, 44 were charged with rioting, a crime that could mean up to 10 years in prison.The police condemned protesters for using petrol bombs, slingshots and bricks as weapons.“Things are getting more serious now, and more violent. The government is not listening and that is unacceptable,” said Chun Yee, 28, a piano teacher who joined hundreds of protesters who had taken over a mall in Sha Tin, where protesters and police clashed weeks ago.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. The clashes, which continued late into the night on Monday, came after civil servants, drivers, teachers, construction workers and others missed work to join rallies around the city – the first general strike in Hong Kong for more than 50 years. Swaths of the city were paralysed, more than 200 flights were cancelled and several lines of the MTR, the rail network serving Hong Kong, were suspended.“I am here to support the youngsters. They fight really hard for Hong Kong’s freedom,” said Camille Lam, 28, who stayed away from her administrative job on Monday.As the strike got under way, Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, addressed journalists after a two-week absence from public view, giving remarks that further angered protesters and brought more out to the rallies. Lam condemned protesters for damaging Hong Kong’s economy and stability.“Such extensive disruptions in the name of certain demands or uncooperative movement have seriously undermined Hong Kong law and order and are pushing our city, the city we all love, and many of us helped to build, to the verge of a very dangerous situation,” Lam said.Joel Tse, a 25-year-old advertising industry professional, said: “I want Carrie Lam to come out and fix the problem, not give us some bullshit.”He said he had been on the fence about whether to join the strike. But after watching the chief executive’s press conference he had decided to join the thousands dressed in black, the signature colour of the protests, at Tamar Park in Admiralty, near government offices.Others who went to work said they still supported the protesters and their demands: that the extradition bill in question be withdrawn, and that an independent commission be set up to investigate police behaviour over the last two months.“This is a last resort,” said Cindy Chan, waiting in a long bus queue after severe delays on her local railway line. “The government doesn’t listen to the opinions of the people and later you can see it’s getting worse and worse,” she said.",Hong Kong protests descend into chaos during citywide strike,2019-08-05/17:20:00,hong kong

"Protesters in Hong Kong have pledged to stand up to thugs who attacked demonstrators at the weekend as public anger grows towards the government and police.Demonstrators have filed for a permit to hold a rally on Saturday in Yuen Long, the district on the outskirts of Hong Kong where dozens of masked men chased and beat commuters and protesters with wooden poles and metal rods, leaving at least 45 people in hospital. Police arrived after the assailants left.Footage of the attack, which included a pregnant woman being hit, protesters being punched and kneed, and commuters screaming and crying while trying to shield themselves, emerged on Sunday night, fuelling further political unrest as demonstrators, opposition lawmakers and others demanded answers from authorities for failing to stop the violence.Max Chung, who delivered the application for a letter of no objection from the police, that is required to hold a rally, said: “We want to show to the public and international community that Hong Kongers, we will never surrender in front of terrorism … To show our solidarity and say no to terrorism, we have to stand up.” Chung said: “Yuen Long was under terrorist attack and we have no choice but to take it back.” The protests, principally over a controversial bill that would allow suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China, have taken on new demands, including an investigation into police use of rubber bullets, teargas and physical violence against protesters.Protesters are angry at the police’s slow response to the attack in Yuen Long and their pursuit of the case. Six people have been arrested for “unlawful assembly”.The violence in Yuen Long has heightened tensions and fears of further attacks. On Tuesday evening, unverified footage showed men in white gathering in Tuen Mun, another city near Yuen Long in the New Territories. One video circulating online showed two men in white dragging a man in a black shirt across the road, but there were no reports of major disturbances.Protesters and residents are also angry at the government’s weak condemnation of the violence. Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, said the “shocking violence” in Yuen Long would be investigated, but devoted most of her comments to criticising protesters, who surrounded Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong and defaced the national emblem of the People’s Republic of China on Sunday.“My team and I are here to show that while some of our work was not done properly … my colleagues and I have been making efforts to identify the root causes of this discontent,” she said.Lam’s remarks failed to placate residents. On Tuesday, a group of aviation staff called for a protest at Hong Kong airport on Friday to condemn the government and police for “ignoring the random attacks on citizens in Yuen Long”. Other activists called for a strike from classes and work the following Monday if Lam does not respond to their demands. A group of medical workers has also called for a sit-in on Friday.In Yuen Long, Chung and other protesters are demanding the government conducts an independent investigation and officially characterises the violence as a “cross-border terrorist attack”. Demonstrators believe some of the assailants were from mainland China.As demonstrators circulated calls for the rally on Saturday, rumours of impending violence from residents or men wearing white spread, giving protesters pause.Organisers said they had mapped out the safest route possible along main roads, from a playground in the centre of the district to the railway station where the attack took place.The violence in Yuen Long marks a sinister turn for the demonstrations, which had been largely peaceful.Hailey Leung, a university student who has been attending the protests this summer, said: “The fear of the gangs is definitely stronger than the fear of the use of violence of the police.” Her parents have been supportive of the protests but, since the violence in Yuen Long, they have asked her not to attend. “I believe some if not most of the young people will continue to fight for what they want, even if they know it is going to be dangerous,” she said. But Leung may not attend the rally on Saturday, saying: “It is one thing to run away from teargas and another thing to fight against the gangsters.”",Hong Kong protesters pledge to stand up to thugs after attack,2019-07-23/18:48:34,protesters in hong kong have pledged to stand up to thugs who attacked demonstrators at the weekend as public anger grows towards the government and police demonstrators have filed for a permit to hold a rally on saturday in yuen long the district on the outskirts of hong kong where dozens of masked men chased and beat commuters and protesters with wooden poles and metal rods leaving at least  people in hospital police arrived after the assailants left footage of the attack which included a pregnant woman being hit protesters being punched and kneed and commuters screaming and crying while trying to shield themselves emerged on sunday night fuelling further political unrest as demonstrators opposition lawmakers and others demanded answers from authorities for failing to stop the violence max chung who delivered the application for a letter of no objection from the police that is required to hold a rally said we want to show to the public and international community that hong kongers we will never surrender in front of terrorism to show our solidarity and say no to terrorism we have to stand up chung said yuen long was under terrorist attack and we have no choice but to take it back the protests principally over a controversial bill that would allow suspects to be extradited from hong kong to mainland china have taken on new demands including an investigation into police use of rubber bullets teargas and physical violence against protesters protesters are angry at the police s slow response to the attack in yuen long and their pursuit of the case six people have been arrested for unlawful assembly the violence in yuen long has heightened tensions and fears of further attacks on tuesday evening unverified footage showed men in white gathering in tuen mun another city near yuen long in the new territories one video circulating online showed two men in white dragging a man in a black shirt across the road but there were no reports of major disturbances protesters and residents are also angry at the government s weak condemnation of the violence hong kong s leader carrie lam said the shocking violence in yuen long would be investigated but devoted most of her comments to criticising protesters who surrounded beijing s liaison office in hong kong and defaced the national emblem of the people s republic of china on sunday my team and i are here to show that while some of our work was not done properly my colleagues and i have been making efforts to identify the root causes of this discontent she said lam s remarks failed to placate residents on tuesday a group of aviation staff called for a protest at hong kong airport on friday to condemn the government and police for ignoring the random attacks on citizens in yuen long other activists called for a strike from classes and work the following monday if lam does not respond to their demands a group of medical workers has also called for a sit in on friday in yuen long chung and other protesters are demanding the government conducts an independent investigation and officially characterises the violence as a cross border terrorist attack demonstrators believe some of the assailants were from mainland china as demonstrators circulated calls for the rally on saturday rumours of impending violence from residents or men wearing white spread giving protesters pause organisers said they had mapped out the safest route possible along main roads from a playground in the centre of the district to the railway station where the attack took place the violence in yuen long marks a sinister turn for the demonstrations which had been largely peaceful hailey leung a university student who has been attending the protests this summer said the fear of the gangs is definitely stronger than the fear of the use of violence of the police her parents have been supportive of the protests but since the violence in yuen long they have asked her not to attend i believe some if not most of the young people will continue to fight for what they want even if they know it is going to be dangerous she said but leung may not attend the rally on saturday saying it is one thing to run away from teargas and another thing to fight against the gangsters ,Hong Kong Protests,0.304820865
"The decision by Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, to withdraw the controversial extradition bill that has plunged the Chinese territory into its worst political crisis in years seems unlikely to end the months-long protests in the semi-autonomous city – with police violence remaining a key concern for demonstrators.Many ordinary Hong Kong residents, as well as protesters, have lambasted the move as too little, too late, and vowed to continue demonstrating. Late on Wednesday, dozens shouted slogans and set up makeshift barricades outside a police station in the Mong Kok district in the first protest after Lam’s announcement.Her statement came almost three months after the first mass protest against the bill, which would have resulted in citizens being extradited to China’s opaque courts for trial. The protests have since morphed into a broader, and increasingly violent, anti-government movement, with animosity between police and protesters reaching boiling point.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongSince June, there have been protests almost every weekend, many turning violent. Smaller scale clashes have happened nearly every night in various districts in recent weeks. Police on Wednesday said 1,183 people had been arrested since 9 June.Joshua Wong, a high-profile protester who was arrested along with a number of activists last week, said “the intensified police brutality in the previous weeks have left an irreversible scar to the entire Hong Kong society” and was the reason many people did not believe the bill withdrawal was “a sincere move”.The 22-year-old, the face of the Umbrella movement in Hong Kong in 2014, said the government in Beijing hoped to cool down the protests by withdrawing the bill, “But our determination and courage to fight for freedom will still continue.”“I hope the people in China can understand that democracy, freedom and human rights are universal values that Hong Kong people are fighting for,” he told journalists before a forum in Taipei, Taiwan, where he is visiting.“We will continue to fight for it. I hope there is one day that Hong Kong and even China would become a place where people can enjoy democracy and freedom.”Hongkongers interviewed by the Guardian on Wednesday said the bill’s withdrawal would not dampen the protests, as the crisis had snowballed into a much bigger movement. Infuriated by the police’s use of force, they want the government to set up an independent body to investigate police wrongdoing, a request Lam again rejected on Wednesday.The police’s use of force has escalated in recent weeks while protesters have also resorted to increasingly violent measures. Police have used water cannons, teargas, rubber bullets, beanbag rounds and severe beatings to quell unrest, and also chased protesters into residential areas, metro stations and even ferry piers. In retaliation, protesters have thrown molotov cocktails at police, and vandalised and set public facilities on fire in what they said were defensive moves.This week, as the new school term started, riot police turned up outside schools where students had boycotted classes and staged protests. Many young people said they felt intimidated by the police. Reports of maltreatment and sexual abuse of detained protesters in custody that have emerged in recent weeks have further fuelled anger. Two men were hospitalised after police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray on demonstrators outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station late on Tuesday, an example of the police brutality that many protesters say needs to be investigated.“Of course I don’t accept this. Why didn’t she do this three months ago? None of this [mess] would have happened. Now, so many people have been arrested and so many have been beaten over their heads,” said a 57-year-old construction worker, who gave his surname as Chow.Another protester, who gave his surname as Chan, who said he had faced off with the police in many violent conflicts over recent weeks, said he would continue taking to the streets because he was outraged the authorities were not making the police accountable for the use of excessive force.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. “So many people have been beaten and maltreated by the police. If she [Lam] really wants to solve the problem she should thoroughly investigate police violence,” he said.In formally withdrawing the bill, Lam has satisfied one of the protesters’ five demands, which also include the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence; a halt to the characterisation of protests as “riots”; amnesty for those arrested; and democratic reforms to give Hong Kong residents universal suffrage.Lam said again on Wednesday she would not set up an independent body to investigate alleged police brutality. She said the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) already took responsibility for that, and would engage with international experts to work on a report. Critics say the body is full of pro-government figures, who are unlikely to carry out an unbiased investigation.Lam also said she would not concede to other demands, such as stopping referring to the protests as riots and dropping charges against protesters, saying these were up to the department of justice and government prosecutors.She said universal suffrage, which the umbrella movement in 2014 failed to pressure the government into granting, should be “discussed within the legal framework”.Many people interviewed by the Guardian said all their demands must be met, with the most urgent being an inquiry into police violence, saying those who had been maltreated must be vindicated.They said the escalating police brutality and the government’s hostility towards ordinary people in the past three months have made it hard for them to trust the authorities again.A masked spokeswoman dressed in black speaking on behalf of a group of protesters at a press conference late Wednesday said the withdrawal of the bill was a quick fix like “a band-aid on rotten flesh”.“Does the government honestly think that the trauma, grievances and anguish they caused could be so easily dismissed with two syllables? Expecting the word ‘withdraw’ to salvage all they have caused is childish and tone-deaf at best,” she said.“Lam is just trying to fool us; Hong Kongers will never accept such a deal. Look at how much we have sacrificed, this deal is humiliating,” said a university administrator called Zoe.",Hong Kong protesters vow to stay on the streets despite Carrie Lam

"More than 20 people have appeared in court in Hong Kong charged with rioting, as hundreds of supporters gathered outside the building chanting “revolution of our time” and “liberate Hong Kong”.The hearings marked the first time authorities have resorted to the serious charges of rioting since the beginning of a wave of unrest that has plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis since its return to Chinese rule in 1997.The charges, which follow arrests during violent clashes between police and protesters on Sunday, infuriated activists who have demanded that the government avoid using the term “riot” to refer to the demonstrations.Under Hong Kong law, rioting is defined as an unlawful assembly of three or more people where any person “commits a breach of the peace”, and a conviction can carry a 10-year prison sentence.As the crisis in Hong Kong mounted, reports on Wednesday said the US was monitoring what a senior Trump administration official called a buildup of Chinese forces on Hong Kong’s border. Although the nature of the Chinese buildup was not clear, the anonymous official told Bloomberg that units of the Chinese military or armed police had gathered at the border.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office.

Police used pepper spray to try to disperse them. One officer also appeared carrying a shotgun, which he pointed at protesters. The South China Morning Post reported that the gun had been loaded with bean bag rounds.In one video circulated on social media, a police officer was seen punching a photographer, then wildly waving a baton at a journalist, who was wearing a yellow vest and who was forced to flee.Fireworks were set off just before 3am at another police station, injuring six men. Video footage on social media appeared to show a car driving by the Tin Shui Wai police station as fireworks flared where protesters were gathered. Five people were taken to a hospital and the sixth man declined medical treatment at the scene, police said. It was not clear who was responsible.As the demonstration continued into the early hours of Wednesday, protesters and supporters remained highly wary of being identified by the authorities and suffering potential retribution at their places of work and study.Nine of the defendants had been released on bail of HK$1,000 (US$128) by noon, Reuters reported. They were ordered to remain in Hong Kong and a curfew was imposed between midnight and 6am.“I’m not scared to protest. This whole thing today is just making me more angry,” said Gartner, a 21-year-old protester outside the court who declined to give his full name. “I don’t think it will scare people.”“The Chinese government just wants to scare people not to go out and protest again,” Syrus, 19, said outside the court, where an approaching typhoon brought blustery conditions on Wednesday afternoon.Police said in a statement on Tuesday that the people facing riot charges had set up roadblocks, broke fences, damaged street signs and attacked officers with bricks and iron rods. The unannounced protests on Tuesday capped another day of unrest. During the morning rush-hour, commuters argued with demonstrators who blocked subway train doors in their continuing campaign to demand greater accountability from the semi-autonomous Chinese territory’s government.The action targeted rush-hour traffic at several stations. MTR responded by providing minibuses to replace delayed trains, and normal service was restored by around noon.One protester, Ken Chan, said he wanted MTR officials to explain why they allegedly failed to take action on 21 July when a large gang of men in white shirts beat dozens of people inside a train station as a huge protest was winding down.“How could they let the triads in white attack people on the platform randomly, including the elderly and children in the train?” said Chan, 32. “Some of the elderly got smacked on their heads, but [MTR staff] turned a blind eye to it.”Lorraine Lee, 26, said the subway disruption was an attempt to remind people of the government’s alleged failure to deal with social, economic and political injustices.“The government has not been addressing the problems in our society,” Lee said. “That is why now Hongkongers have no choice but to use different ‘creative’ approaches to remind people what is happening in Hong Kong.”The South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday that the city’s corruption watchdog was setting up a special group to investigate the police’s response to the 21 July attacks. Many protesters have accused the police of colluding with triads, Hong Kong’s organised crime syndicates, and of failing to protect the public.The disruption is part of a pro-democracy movement that has led to hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets this summer for marches and rallies. The protests have shaken the government in Hong Kong while the Chinese authorities have accused unidentified foreign actors of encouraging the protests. Activists began protesting in early June for the government to withdraw an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to stand trial in mainland China, where critics say their legal rights would be threatened. The government suspended the bill, but the protests have expanded to include call for democracy and government accountability.Associated Press contributed to this report",Hong Kong protesters charged

"Amnesty International has warned of an “alarming pattern” of violence used by Hong Kong police at anti-government demonstrations over the past three months, with officers reportedly beating protesters before and after arrest.Based on interviews with 48 people, including lawyers and 21 arrested protesters, Amnesty International’s East Asia director, Nicholas Bequelin, said the human rights group had shown that “time and time again, officers meted out violence prior to and during arrests, even when the individual had been arrested or detained”, contrary to international human rights law.“The evidence leaves little room for doubt: in an apparent thirst for retaliation, Hong Kong’s security forces have engaged in a disturbing pattern of reckless and unlawful tactics against people during protests,” he said, including “arbitrary arrests and retaliatory violence”.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office.

Three of them got on me and pressed my face hard to the ground. A second later, they kicked my face … The same three [tactical officers] kept putting pressure on my body,” he said, adding that he then had difficulty breathing and pain in his ribcage. “They just said to me, ‘Just shut up, stop making noise.’”In exceptional cases, a few protesters reported that they were also beaten by officers in detention and suffered “ill-treatment [amounting to] torture”. One man reported that police beat him after he refused to answer questions and threatened to “break his hands if he tried to protect himself”.The report is the latest in a series of indictments of police violence in Hong Kong, which has helped to sustain anti-government protests for over three months.It follows similar testimony about excessive use of police violence by democracy activists Denise Ho and Joshua Wong before a US Congressional-Executive Commission on China hearing about the Hong Kong protests this week.Ho told legislators that it had “become a common daily scene to see youngsters being pinned to the ground, with bleeding head concussions and some even knocked unconscious, but still refused medical care by the police”. She added that “riot police and plainclothes officers have shown no restraint while performing their duties”.Although the chief executive, Carrie Lam, this month formally withdrew the extradition bill that first sparked demonstrations on 9 June, protesters say they will not go home until she meets all five protest demands, including an independent inquiry into police violence.Lam has offered to initiate a “platform for dialogue” with community stakeholders as well as a review by the Independent Police Complaints Council, but protesters have said they do not trust the council, or her. This month the chief executive has experienced some of her lowest ratings since protests began. The secretary for security, John Lee, who oversees the police, has also seen his approval rating bottom out.Mistrust in police remains widespread even as frontline protesters have escalated their tactics to include petrol bombs, bricks and in some cases even fighting with officers with sticks and hiking polls.Protest chants have called for police to “return the eye” of one woman who was severely injured by a police bullet, while another has asked police to reveal the “missing” protesters who many believe disappeared after an intense clash at a subway station on 31 August.Ted Hui, a Democratic legislator who has attended protest frontlines as an observer and was arrested this month for “obstruction”, told the Guardian that police use of batons – in lieu of rubber bullets – had ramped up since August, and that he had personally seen protesters hit on the head and across their body.He said many of those arrested at anti-government demonstrations, who now number about 1,400, were not frontline protesters throwing petrol bombs but rather those standing farther back or even bystanders observing the conflict.“I would say that many times the arrests are unlawful and arbitrary. I see the radical protesters, who really use some level of force, protest and [then] they are gone very quickly and so the police are not able to arrest them,” he said.“Instead, the police are there to arrest other people – even those people who are peaceful protesters and they just joined the rally and they just have a mask with them and that’s it, without any other weapons. They will arrest them just because they look young or they are in black shirts or masks.” ",Hong Kong police show 'alarming pattern' of violence at protests,2019-09-19/17:00:36,amnesty international

"Hong Kong has been gripped by another night of violence after a peaceful afternoon march in Tai Po splintered into several fronts as protesters attempted to outrun the police.Riot police fired teargas at crowds in the neighbouring districts of Shatin and Tai Wai on Saturday night in an attempt to disperse black-clad protesters who had barricaded roads with nearby supplies.Several kilometres away, riot police also used teargas on crowds in the tourist district of Tsim Sha Tsui, while across the city at Hong Kong International airport a peaceful sit-in continued into its second day.The majority of protesters, however, appeared to be mobile on Saturday night, with thousands dispersing across the New Territories and Kowloon after receiving reports of police movements on messaging apps.“The strategy is, when the police come we will leave and change to a different place,” said Michael Wong, a nursing student and volunteer medic. “When the police come to a different place they need to plan and have a reaction time, so we use [it] to just buy time.”The cat and mouse game, often referred to by the slogan “be water”, has made recent protests less predictable than at the beginning of June when anti-government demonstrations began against a legislative bill that many feared was an attack on Hong Kong’s civil and political rights.“Everyone is the frontline. You can decide what you are going to do,” said one protester who asked to not be named for fear of repercussions. “[Some] are going to Shatin or the airport, but you can decide what to do.”As protests enter their 10th week, Hong Kong appears to be facing its worst political crisis since its return to Chinese rule in 1997 as the government fails to respond to intense public anger at the legislative bill and heavy-handed police tactics.Protests have become an almost daily occurrence across the city, with large-scale demonstrations reserved for the weekend.Much of the anger sustaining the protests appears to come from longstanding fears about the future of Hong Kong under Chinese rule, and the government’s inability to understand or act on the desires of many of its residents after the failure of 2014’s democracy protests.Over the past five years, the government appears to have moved increasingly closer to Beijing although Hong Kong was promised semi-autonomy until 2047.One protester, Alice Chan, said she regarded Carrie Lam’s failure as Hong Kong’s leader to respond to protest demands, which have remained much the same for 10 weeks, as a sign of Chinese interference. Lam has not withdrawn the legislative bill, which would have allowed for criminal suspects to be deported to stand trial in mainland Chinese courts, although she has pledged it is suspended.“I think they just want to hear and do what the Beijing government wants them to do,” Chan said. “It’s not what Hong Kong people want them to do. It’s the difference since the umbrella revolution.”Mistrust in the Hong Kong government and its autonomy, which is protected by the “one country, two systems” agreement, has led to many protesters calling for direct elections for the first time since 2014.",Hong Kong riot police fire teargas at protest groups,2019-08-10/15:21:58,hong kong has been gripped by another night of violence after a peaceful afternoon march in tai po splintered into several fronts as protesters attempted to outrun the police riot police fired teargas at crowds in the neighbouring districts of shatin and tai wai on saturday night in an attempt to disperse black clad protesters who had barricaded roads with nearby supplies several kilometres away riot police also used teargas on crowds in the tourist district of tsim sha tsui while across the city at hong kong international airport a peaceful sit in continued into its second day the majority of protesters however appeared to be mobile on saturday night with thousands dispersing across the new territories and kowloon after receiving reports of police movements on messaging apps the strategy is when the police come we will leave and change to a different place said michael wong a nursing student and volunteer medic when the police come to a different place they need to plan and have a reaction time so we use it to just buy time the cat and mouse game often referred to by the slogan be water has made recent protests less predictable than at the beginning of june when anti government demonstrations began against a legislative bill that many feared was an attack on hong kong s civil and political rights everyone is the frontline you can decide what you are going to do said one protester who asked to not be named for fear of repercussions some are going to shatin or the airport but you can decide what to do as protests enter their th week hong kong appears to be facing its worst political crisis since its return to chinese rule in  as the government fails to respond to intense public anger at the legislative bill and heavy handed police tactics protests have become an almost daily occurrence across the city with large scale demonstrations reserved for the weekend much of the anger sustaining the protests appears to come from longstanding fears about the future of hong kong under chinese rule and the government s inability to understand or act on the desires of many of its residents after the failure of  s democracy protests over the past five years the government appears to have moved increasingly closer to beijing although hong kong was promised semi autonomy until  one protester alice chan said she regarded carrie lam s failure as hong kong s leader to respond to protest demands which have remained much the same for  weeks as a sign of chinese interference lam has not withdrawn the legislative bill which would have allowed for criminal suspects to be deported to stand trial in mainland chinese courts although she has pledged it is suspended i think they just want to hear and do what the beijing government wants them to do chan said it s not what hong kong people want them to do it s the difference since the umbrella revolution mistrust in the hong kong government and its autonomy which is protected by the one country two systems agreement has led to many protesters calling for direct elections for the first time since  ,Hong Kong Protests,0.295257002
"In extraordinary scenes that could have been a direct replay of 2014’s Occupy Central protests, thousands of anti-government protesters surrounded the Hong Kong government offices and Legislative Council building at Admiralty today, blocking roads and forcing the government to postpone a planned meeting to debate a controversial proposed extradition law.Again, as in 2014, today’s protesters were primarily youths, clad in black t-shirts and chanting “Cit Wui!” (“Withdraw!”). Drawing on their experience from the Umbrella Movement, protesters quickly equipped themselves with protective gear – face masks, goggles, hard-hats – in anticipation of police batons, capsicum spray, or even tear gas and rubber bullets. Police formed three-deep defensive lines equipped with riot shields, truncheons and guns. By mid-morning, protester supply stations – well-stocked with water, foodstuffs, first-aid supplies and other necessities – were already springing up.Unlike in 2014, the protesters have two advantages which may increase their chances of success. Then, they were trying to push the government to adopt a “genuinely democratic” means of electing the territory’s chief executive – although specifically which model of genuine democracy the protesters could not quite seem to agree upon. This time, their request is simple: they want the government to drop a proposed new extradition law. And it is truism in politics that it is easier to oppose than propose.The protesters’ second advantage is that public opinion seems to be much more solidly unified behind them this time. Over one million people took to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday to protest the proposed new law. Why has this issue galvanised public opinion and provoked a response like no other in recent years?The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation.

China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongThe key to the public reaction may lie in the issue at the heart of the protests yesterday and those sixteen years ago, when 500,000 people filled the streets to protest proposed laws that would criminalise acts of sedition against the Beijing government.The current proposal would enable Beijing to extradite criminal suspects from Hong Kong to face trial on the mainland. Not since 2003 has the Hong Kong government attempted to push a policy that was so blatantly in the interests of Beijing, and contrary to the interests of the people of Hong Kong. Yet there is a deeper reason at the heart of why these issues have provoked such a visceral response from the Hong Kong populace.In the past, Hong Kong had distinguished itself on the basis of wealth: Hong Kong was rich, while the rest of China was struggling to bring its population out of poverty. However, over the twenty years since the handover in 1997, as Hong Kong’s economy has drifted and China’s boomed, that distinction has failed to hold. Pride rooted in materialism has been replaced by a deeper pride among Hong Kongers, based around the notion of “Hong Kong Core Values”, those rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong that distinguish it from the rest of China. Hong Kong Core Values include: a lively and unfettered media, the right to participate in the electoral and governing process, freedom to criticise the government, rule of law and due process, an independent judiciary, and, of course, the right to protest. “Hong Kong core values” has become the answer to the question: “What does it mean to be a Hong Konger?”The current proposed extradition law, by blurring the line between the Hong Kong and mainland justice systems, is seen as another attack on Hong Kong core values. The million people on Hong Kong’s streets on Sunday and those gathering again today are protesting not just against a theoretical risk of extradition to the opaque mainland criminal justice system; they are protesting a threat to their very identity as Hong Kongers. And by taking to the streets, they were expressing their dissatisfaction by exercising of one of those key rights and freedoms: I am a Hong Konger, therefore I protest.The government led by chief executive Carrie Lam now faces a dilemma — ignore the clearly expressed will of the people and face the potential for ugly clashes on the streets and international condemnation, or face the wrath of Beijing.• Antony Dapiran is a Hong Kong-based writer and lawyer and the author of the book City of Protest: A Recent History of Dissent in Hong Kong",Hong Kong's identity as a city of rights and

"Thousands of demonstrators marched in Hong Kong on Saturday, facing the threat of arrest and increasingly severe warnings from Beijing.Protesters clad head to toe in black, carrying umbrellas and orange helmets, deviated from the route approved by police and took over a major road of the normally busy shopping district of Mongkok. One group held a black banner with the words: “The police have overstepped”, while others chanted for the release of protesters who have been arrested over the last two months of demonstrations.“We are still fighting for our demands. Honestly, it’s tiring but it’s our duty and our responsibility,” said Jacqueline Chan, 17. “We are Hong Kong people. We live here. We were born here. Although it’s tiring we must come out and fight for our freedom.”Shops along the main road were closed and residents crowded the pavements watching demonstrators. Some handed out juice boxes and snacks while others cheered. Protesters distributed protective gear such as face masks, in the event of clashes with police, who have used teargas on demonstrators.The previously banned march was sanctioned by the police at the last minute and is one of several protests this weekend in Hong Kong.As the city enters its ninth consecutive week of protests, the movement shows few signs of abating, as public anger at the government spreads to more parts of Hong Kong society.Thousands of civil servants, medical workers and staff from the city’s finance sector rallied on Thursday and Friday, while further protests were planned through the weekend. Demonstrators have also called for a citywide strike on Monday, which has already been backed by major businesses and unions.The protests, which began over a proposal to allow extradition to China, pose the most serious challenge to China’s authority over the city since 1997, when it was returned from British to Chinese control.In recent days, Beijing has ramped up its condemnation of the protests, which it describes as “riots”, and has accused the US and other western powers of instigating the unrest to hurt China.On Thursday, Chen Daoxiang, the head of the Chinese army garrison in Hong Kong, said the military was “determined to protect [the] national sovereignty” of Hong Kong and would help put down the “intolerable” unrest if requested. The army released a promotional video showing tanks and soldiers firing on citizens in an anti-riot drill.Hong Kong police on Thursday also charged 44 people linked to the protests with “rioting”, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. On online forums there were claims that police decided to allow the previously banned protest in Mongkok in order to surround demonstrators and arrest them en masse.Others are increasingly worried about violence and escalating police tactics, which have included firing rubber bullets as well as teargas. Police were reportedly testing out water cannons.“People are getting more scared,” said Chan. “But it will not change what we do. We will not [stop] because of fear.” “Every time I think it may be the last time but I try my best,” said another protester who asked not to give her name.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office.

China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongDespite the arrests and warnings, demonstrators appear to be escalating and shifting their tactics. Over the last week, dozens have surrounded police stations where the arrested are believed to be held. Others appear to be focused on gathering more support among the public, or targeting international audiences.“If peaceful marches that disrupt the road for an afternoon or so don’t work, maybe it spills over to blockading more roads, maybe for long. If that doesn’t work? Maybe next time people would besiege a government building ... It goes on and on,” said one protester, who asked to only give his first name, Chris.“It’s like a hydra – whether it grows more heads, or its feet have become more threatening, the whole hydra has become a bigger threat.”Despite the interruptions, large swathes of the public appear sympathetic to the protesters, with many pledging to join the strike on Monday. Some residents have organised a donation drive, for clothes of any colour other than black, for protesters to quickly change out of their signature all black outfits and avoid being picked out by police.On Saturday, groups representing almost two dozen sectors, from retail to construction and engineering, issued a joint letter of their intention to strike on Monday. The statement condemned authorities for turning “a deaf ear to peaceful protests from a wide section society” and threatened more actions.“If the government does not respond … we shall launch more and larger strikes and non-cooperation movements. We shall never give up until we succeed,” it said.",Hong Kong protesters risk arrest as Beijing steps up warnings,2019-08-03/12:17:06,thousands of demonstrators marched in hong kong on saturday facing

"Driven by anger and grief, thousands of people came on to the streets of Hong Kong on Wednesday to denounce the shooting of a teenage student by police, an escalation of force that has intensified the standoff between protesters and authorities.In the daytime the protesters marched through the city centre, organised sit-ins at schools and gathered at a courtroom where other demonstrators faced rioting charges. In the evening thousands more joined largely peaceful rallies across Hong Kong, denouncing police brutality. Some called for the police force to be disbanded.Many at the demonstrations held their hands over the left side of their chests in tribute to 18-year-old Tsang Chi-kin, who was shot at point-blank range on Tuesday, with the bullet narrowly missing his heart. Tsang was in hospital in stable but critical condition after surgery to remove the bullet.The shooting shocked many in the city; despite copious use of teargas, water cannon, beanbags and other less lethal forms of violence over nearly four months of protests, officers had previously only fired their guns in warning.After more than 20 years of civil war, Mao Zedong leads the communists to victory over the nationalists, and proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China on 1 October.China launches a five-year economic plan, the ""Great Leap Forward"",  collectivising farming and investing in heavy industry.

The country's human rights record also comes under scrutiny for its treatment of the Uighurs, with claims that more than 1 million of them have been detained in camps the Chinese have euphemistically called “vocational education centres”.Tsang’s injury and the wider chaos of Tuesday’s protests, called to mark the 70th anniversary of communist rule in China as a “day of grief”, appeared to have further radicalised both demonstrators and their opponents.The city’s largest police group called for a curfew, or for the government to bring in harsh colonial-era emergency powers, claiming its officers were working in “war-zone-like” conditions, the South China Morning Post reported.Pro-Beijing politicians backed its demands and defended the police officer who opened fire, the Hong Kong Free Press reported. “It was a reasonable and legal action,” said legislator Gary Chan. “The government should consider enacting an emergency law to stop the riots as soon as possible.”A new Hong Kong extradition law is proposed, which would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for a variety of crimes. Residents fear it could lead to politically motivated extraditions into China's much harsher judicial system.Large public demonstrations start as thousands march in the streets to protest against the extradition bill.Hong Kong lawmakers scuffle in parliament during a row over the law.Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences, but critics say they are not enough.The scale of protests continues to increase as more than half a million people take to the streets. Police use rubber bullets and teargas against the biggest protests Hong Kong has seen for decades.Lam says the proposed extradition law has been postponed indefinitely.The protests continue as demonstrators storm the Legislative Council, destroying pictures, daubing graffiti on the walls and flying the old flag of Hong Kong emblazoned with the British union flag. The protests coincide with the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the UK back to China.Armed men in white T-shirts thought to be supporting the Chinese government attack passengers and passers-by in Yuen Long metro station, while nearby police take no action.44 protesters are charged with rioting, which further antagonises the anti-extradition bill movement.By now the protest movement has coalesced around five key demands: complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, withdrawal of the use of the word ""riot"" in relation to the protests, unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped, an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of genuine universal suffrage.The mass protests enter their fifteenth week, with police resorting to teargas and water cannon against the demonstrators, and a wave of ""doxxing"" using digital techniques to unmask police and protesters as a new front in the battle.Police shoot a protester with live ammunition for the first time, as demonstrations continue on the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People's Republic of China.The first charges are brought against protesters for covering their faces, after authorities bring in new laws banning face masks in order to make it easier to identify or detain protesters.Hong Kong officials spark outrage in the city as it revealed that nearly a third of protesters arrested since June have been children. Seven hundred and 50 out of the 2,379 people arrested  were under 18, and 104 were under 16.Lam is forced to deliver a key annual policy speech via video link after after being heckled in parliament, as the legislative council resumed sessions after it was suspended on 12 June. Later in the day one of the protest leaders, Jimmy Sham, was attacked by assailants wielding hammers and knives.Chan Tong-kai, the murder suspect whose case prompted the original extradition bill is released from prison, saying that he is willing to surrender himself to Taiwan. The extradition bill is also formally withdrawn, a key demand of protesters.Protesters in turn warned Hong Kong authorities that they would not back down. One declared: “This is war,” at a press conference outside Tsang’s school in the working-class Tsuen Wan district that brought together activist groups, protesters and the injured student’s classmates.“On a day of celebration in Beijing, the people of Hong Kong were weeping from the teargas and bleeding from the bullets fired,” said the protester, his face hidden behind a bandana and sunglasses. He asked to be described only as a “Hong Kong citizen”.“The people of Hong Kong are sick and tired of having mere words of condemnation as their only shield against lethal bullets and rifles. Because by now it is beyond clear that this government does not even take its own people seriously.”Others paid tribute to Tsang, who used the English name Tony, and called for international support while promising to forge a stronger resistance movement.The protests were originally sparked by anger at a now-withdrawn extradition bill, but have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement with five core demands including an inquiry into police violence.“Tony has always been a role model to junior classmates. He is also one of the best people I know,” said a friend who gave his last name, Wong. “The anti-extradition movement gave him renewed purpose. Despite his tender age he never hesitated to stand up for the future of Hong Kong.”Behind the speakers, school students in uniform gathered to chant protest slogans, including: “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.” They held banners attacking police brutality. Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said her government will formally withdraw the bill that ignited months of protests. Hong Kong residents had feared it could be used by China to extradite people for political reasons. They want guarantees that it cannot be reintroduced at a later date.Protesters want the government to officially recognise that their movement has been a series of legitimate protests, rather than a riot, as has been stated in official communications.Hundreds of people have been arrested in recent weeks, and the protesters are demanding that all of them be freed, and that no convictions should stand against any of them.Police use of force has escalated since the demonstrations began, while protesters have also resorted to increasingly violent measures. Demonstrators say an inquiry into police brutality is the number-one priority.Hong Kong's chief executive is currently selected by a 1,200-member committee, and nearly half of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by limited electorates representing different sectors of the economy. The protesters want to be able to vote for their leaders in free and open democratic elections. Earlier, hundreds of students, alumni and staff gathered for a morning sit-in to support Tsang. He has been arrested for assault, but the school principal said he would be welcome to return to classes once he was released from hospital, defying calls from some pro-Beijing figures for him to be punished for his role in protests.Pictures from across Hong Kong showed students from other schools gathering in forecourts and on sports grounds, often with their hands over their hearts.In the city centre, protesters filed out of their offices around midday, and shut down a main road as they marched peacefully, singing the anthem Glory to Hong Kong.Some carried signs saying: “You can kill the dreamer but you can’t kill the dream”; while others held up their hands with fingers spread wide, a reference to the “five demands” that have become the heart of the protest movement.Hundreds more gathered at a court in West Kowloon, where 96 people arrested at the weekend were expected to be charged with rioting. It was to be the largest mass hearing in the city since the handover from British colonial rule, according to the writer and activist Kong Tsung-gan.The lobby was crammed with relatives and supporters lining up for tickets, but the court had only 100 spaces.A mother of one young detainee said she had only seen him at a distance in hospital since he was arrested on Sunday, because he was receiving treatment for shoulder and arm injuries.Later, more than 2,000 people filled an open-air sports stadium in Tsuen Wan, many holding posters saying: “Don’t shoot our kids,” and waving flashlights on their phones and singing a protest anthem.That gathering was peaceful, but on a march through nearby streets, protesters attacked businesses considered pro-China and barricaded roads. In other parts of the city, protesters threw molotov cocktails and flooded a metro station.In the shopping area of central Causeway Bay, protesters calling for the Hong Kong police to be disbanded began blocking roads, but dispersed before violence broke out. Video from the scene appeared to show people calling on others to go home.Tuesday’s chaos was the worst violence in the city since the protest movement began.

"Hong Kong police have fired teargas at demonstrators and moved to disperse crowds after protesters stormed the legislative council building and raised the territory’s former colonial flag on the 22nd anniversary of its handover to China.The dramatic scenes came after a peaceful march of half a million people made its way through other parts of the city as its deepest political crisis in two decades showed no sign of abating. For the past month protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland as anger has grown against Hong Kong authorities and the territory’s chief executive, Carrie Lam.The police action came against a breakaway group of protesters, some of whom had forced their way into the legislative council building and vandalised its main chamber.Shortly after midnight local time (1600 BST), police in riot gear held up a black flag reading “teargas warning” before shooting several rounds of the gas into protesters. They then climbed over barricades put up by protesters earlier in the day and charged at the people gathered.Outside the legislative council building protesters wearing hard hats, goggles and masks ran away clutching umbrellas as smoke filled the air.Protesters had for hours been repeatedly striking reinforced glass walls with a metal trolley and poles as hundreds of others watched on. Once inside they threw chairs and tore down and defaced portraits of past lawmakers. After the protesters were dispersed, images of the vandalised building were broadcast. More than 50 people were reportedly taken to hospital for treatment after various protests throughout the day.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong“I don’t know whether this would work, but what other channels are there to make Carrie Lam listen to us?” said a male protester outside the legislative council building, who declined to be named.“We used to protest peacefully but it didn’t work, now we need to get out of this framework and tell them, we’re willing to try anything until you give us an answer.”Police had issued several warnings through the evening and appeared to be gearing up for violent clashes, but had left the protesters largely unhindered in their efforts even as the group tore up the inside of the building. Local TV footage showed police officers armed with non-lethal weaponry in other parts of the government complex as the protesters broke in.One lawmaker, Fernando Cheung, suggested to reporters that the inaction from police had been a trap, aimed at swinging public sentiment against the protest movement with the help of violent and destructive scenes.Half a dozen pro-democracy and independent lawmakers had earlier scuffled with protesters as they called for calm and pushed against the trolley that was being used to enter the council building.“They simply wouldn’t listen to me,” said Lam Cheuk-ting, one of the politicians. “The movement at large is peaceful, but some young people are overwhelmed by a strong sense of helplessness and they’re emotionally charged.”While a small splinter group was causing trouble at the legislature, 550,000 people marched peacefully through downtown Hong Kong without any scenes of violence or chaos.The organisers of that rally – the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) – issued a joint statement with democratic lawmakers placing the blame for the destruction at the legislative council squarely on Lam, saying she had “ignored the demands of the people and pushed youngsters towards desperation”.The CHRF also reiterated its five demands: the full retraction of the controversial extradition law amendment bill; an investigation into police brutality; Lam’s resignation; the release of arrested protesters; and the removal of the designation of the earlier clashes as a riot.Lam called a rare press conference early on Tuesday to condemn the “extremely violent” storming of the legislature, which she described as “heartbreaking and shocking”.Speaking beside Lam, police chief Stephen Lo said: “Protesters’ violent acts have far exceeded the bottom line of peaceful expressions of demands.”A joint statement from 41 pro-government lawmakers condemned what they described as “extremely radical and violent acts”, such as the occupying of roads and vandalism of the council building.The rallies are the latest manifestation of growing fears that China is stamping down on the city’s freedoms and culture with the help of the finance hub’s pro-Beijing leaders.Although returned to Chinese rule in 1997, Hong Kong is still administered separately under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems”. The city enjoys rights and liberties unseen on the autocratic mainland, but many residents believe Beijing is reneging on that deal.While the recent protests were initially sparked by Lam’s attempts to pass the proposed extradition legislation, the demonstrations have morphed into a wider movement against her administration and Beijing.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. Both the protesters and the government have in recent weeks been trying to keep public opinion and attention on their side. The protesters have mostly been orderly, obeying traffic laws, cleaning up after themselves and allowing ambulances to pass even when tens of thousands are gathered.They even returned to bow and apologise to civil servants after a small-scale protest forced government offices to shut and the staff to go home early.Up until midnight police were far more restrained with their use of force, having been criticised for their actions against protesters at a smaller protest on 12 June, when they fired 150 rounds of teargas and rubber bullets, and videos of police beating and pepper-spraying unarmed protesters circulated over the internet.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Monday stressed “UK support for Hong Kong and its freedoms”, saying in a statement that “no violence is acceptable but Hong Kong people must preserve the right to peaceful protest exercised within the law, as hundreds of thousands of brave people showed today.”UK diplomats will be concerned that the Hong Kong executive might use the violence as a reason to impose severe penalties on protesters, including possibly reintroducing the suspended extradition law. The UK had been privately pressing for the legislation to be dropped altogether.China also reiterated its stance against what it called “foreign interference” in Hong Kong. Speaking in Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said the UK’s rights and obligations under the joint declaration on the 1997 handover of Hong Kong had ended.“Britain has no so-called responsibility for Hong Kong. Hong Kong matters are purely an internal affair for China. No foreign country has a right to interfere,” Geng told a daily news briefing.“Recently Britain has continuously gesticulated about Hong Kong, flagrantly interfering. We are extremely dissatisfied with this and resolutely opposed.”Earlier in the day, Lam, had attempted to calm the mood, as during an official ceremony took place at a convention centre in WanHong Kong’s Wan Chai todistrict to mark the 22nd anniversary of the handover.In her speech, Lam referred to the protests, saying they had made her realise “the need to grasp public sentiments accurately”. She said: “I am also fully aware that while we have good intentions, we still need to be open and accommodating.”Additional reporting by Patrick Wintour",Hong Kong police fire teargas and charge at

"When Hong Kong’s summer of protests began in June, the city was so shocked by police unleashing 150 canisters of tear gas and using their batons, it helped bring two million people into the streets to demonstrate again and denounce police brutality.Four months of rolling protests later, they used nearly 10 times as many tear gas rounds in 24 hours in a futile bid to control the city as China celebrated 70 years of communist rule last Tuesday. That day police shot a protester with live ammunition for the first time, seriously injuring the teenager. Three days later another schoolboy was shot in the thigh.There have been other serious casualties, including a journalist blinded in one eye, and more than 1,100 people have been treated at hospitals for injuries from the protests.Water cannons laced with dye, beanbags, rubber and sponge-tipped bullets, pepper spray, baton charges and mass arrests have all become common. Gangs of thugs accused of triad links have also attacked demonstrators.Deepening violence has been central to the long standoff between the city’s authorities and its people. Police brutality has fuelled public anger, feeding the protest movement, and as both sides became more entrenched their tactics have escalated.Protesters’ arms and armour are rudimentary compared to police, but they too have become more aggressive as the conflict has deepened, and their tactics have diversified.They have thrown rocks, bricks and molotov cocktails, used poles and slingshots for fighting, set fire to businesses, street barricades, and metro stations – targeted because the network closes to stop people gathering for protests. They have vandalised the city’s legislature, and damaged businesses thought to be pro-China.Protesters have also attacked police and people suspected of being undercover officers or mainland spies. On Friday night a group beat a plainclothes policeman, then threw a molotov cocktail that briefly set the man on fire.It is a dramatic transformation for a city known for its civic values and commitment to “peaceful, rational, non-violent” protest, or wo lei fei in Cantonese shorthand. During the last major protests five years ago – the umbrella movement – some demonstrators even used their totemic umbrellas to shield officers from rain.And hanging over this spiralling showdown are fears the Chinese authorities could lose patience and intervene.Barely veiled threats of state violence issued from the mainland so far include parading paramilitary troops just across the border, releasing a video showing the Chinese garrison in Hong Kong in urban combat and denouncing protesters as terrorists.China’s ambassador to the UK said Beijing would not hesitate to intervene if it thought it was necessary. “If the situation in Hong Kong becomes uncontrollable by Hong Kong government, the central government will not sit on their hands and watch,” Liu Xiaoming told the BBC’s Newsnight.For now, both Beijing and Hong Kong authorities appear to be relying on the city’s police, giving them greater powers by invoking sweeping colonial era laws, and easing constrictions on how they operate.Leaked documents show they loosened guidelines on the use of lethal force on the eve of the student being shot. Changes including removing a line that said “officers will be accountable for their own actions”.Even before that attack, a senior police commander told journalists officers were concerned that escalating violence would end in deaths on the streets, CNN reported.“Our officers are worried that violence has got to such a level that they might have to kill someone or be killed themselves,” the commander said. “This pressure has become extremely dangerous.”But protesters, far from being cowed by violence, arrests, or even the shootings, are promising to die if needed in what they see as a battle for the soul of their city.“There are bound to be deaths and injuries in every revolution. We’re born into this era and if there is a crackdown, we would resist till the last moment,” one demonstrator told the Guardian. He asked not to be named for fear of arrest or reprisals.“If you want to overturn a regime, it’s hard to stay peaceful. Not everyone has to fight, but everyone can use whatever means they have to help,” he said.Police brutality is not only strengthening protestors’ resolve, it has also swelled their numbers. Between the violent clashes, people have repeatedly turned out in their millions to protest heavy-handed policing; an independent inquiry has become a key demand at demonstrations.The police have arrested more than 2,000 people, some as young as 12, the oldest in their 70s. The sight of injured protesters and mass detentions have spurred on others including many Hong Kong residents who say they previously shunned politics, to turn out in support.“Before when people were gathering and they deployed so many riot police, some people would try to leave. Now they don’t,” said Cathy Lam, 24, part of a crowd of local residents from West Kowloon who waited hours to support protesters being arrested on a bus there. “You can see the conflict between police and citizens escalating day by day.”There is a risk that violence – and the damage and shutdowns linked to chaotic protests – may alienate supporters, both in Hong Kong and overseas, and provide pro-Beijing critics with ammunition. Chinese state media widely reports examples of vandalism and attacks by protesters.Yet so far, protesters have largely contained both the extent and focus of their violence, directing it at symbols of the government they are opposing. While authorities have denounced them as rioters, there is little of the random smashing and looting that characterises most riots.“The so-called vandalism they have done is really exceptional, because here it is only focused on targets related to ‘injustice’ they see,” said professor Lawrence Ka-ki Ho, a specialist in policing and public order management at the Education University of Hong Kong.“Most vandalism would have indiscriminate targets, but their targets are the metro stations, the police stations – not the luxurious shops, not M&S.”For the police, by contrast, escalating violence has been disastrous, both sapping their support and bolstering opposition. Yet once authorities or protesters are locked into violence, it becomes difficult for either side to step away.Negotiations to end the stand-off, which would always be fraught, are particularly problematic in Hong Kong, both because there are no real channels of communication between authorities and protesters, and also because the movement doesn’t have any identified leaders.This is in part because of sweeping round-ups of prominent figures during past protests, and part reflection of the grassroots nature of the movement which has taken as its motto ‘be like water’ – fast-moving, powerful, but hard to grasp or block.So even if city authorities want to negotiate, it is not clear if there is anyone with power to call people off the streets.“Many protests do actually generate some kind of reform movement, and its notable in Hong Kong that they have repealed the extradition bill [which first sparked the protests],” said Kristian Gleditsch, regius professor of political science at the University of Essex.“The problem could be that if mobilisation has gone quite far, and many activists are now ready to use violence, these kind of concessions will be seen as too little, too late. And if the protest groups are not strongly organised, there may not be a hierarchy or leadership figures who can control them or negotiate with authorities.”Protesters in turn feel they have no option but to stay on the streets despite the escalation in violence. Hong Kong’s unusual set-up offers civic rights and rule of law but the government is not democratically elected, so public protest is the only way the city’s people can express their political will.“We have access to the internet, journalists can report on the situation live, we have rule of law. We are not totally autocratic. But at the same time our system is not totally democratic. We are not totally open or totally closed,” said Ho. “This hybrid [system] explains the dynamic and the deadlock we have seen.”",A battle for the soul of the city: why violence has spiralled in the

"Activists in Hong Kong have called for a march on Sunday and a boycott of work and classes on Monday in protest against an extradition bill that could result in suspects being sent to mainland China.On Thursday, a day after a demonstration by thousands of people was violently cleared, a group of pro-democracy politicians and activists tried to march on the residence of Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, but were stopped by police.“We need to come out in unity. We call on all demonstrators. We can win if all of us come out,” said Lee Cheuk-yan, a politician and activist, condemning the police and Lam, who has been pushing the bill.Debate in the Legislative Council over the bill was postponed again on Thursday. The proposed law, which critics say Beijing could use to target political enemies in Hong Kong, has brought up to a million people on to the streets to protest. Beijing and Hong Kong authorities insist the law is aimed at combating crime.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongDemonstrators and observers were shocked by the violence of Wednesday, when police charged on protesters, firing rubber bullets and teargas. At least 72 people were taken to hospital, two of whom were in a serious condition.“Emotionally, it’s devastating,” said Yoyo Chan, who has been staging a hunger strike and sit-in on a path just outside the government headquarters. After the protests were cleared on Wednesday, she went to help clean up rubbish left on the streets and found a backpack abandoned by a protester – a young girl, according to her ID card left behind.“She’s so young. [The protesters] are so hopeful and just want to help the city. The way they were oppressed yesterday, it’s heartbreaking,” Chan said.The city was slowly returning to normal after a shutdown on Wednesday. By Thursday morning main traffic arteries had been reopened and evidence of the protests – piles of broken goggles, bottles and umbrellas – had been shunted to the side of the road. Dozens of police patrolled the central Hong Kong area. Several shops in a mall near the site of the protests were shut.The mood was mostly upbeat on Thursday as dispersed groups of demonstrators organised supplies, cleaned up litter and chatted. In Tamar Park, outside the Legislative Council building where lawmakers will debate the proposed bill, a circle of demonstrators were singing worship songs accompanied by a saxophonist.Others were more defiant. A few dozen protesters on an overpass leading into the government complex faced off with police blocking their way. The group stood in silence, holding up laminated signs that said “Retract” and “Go Hong Kong”.Later in the day a new group arrived and held signs that said “Stop police brutality”. Secondary school students held signs up to the police that said “Stop shooting Hong Kong students”. One group of protesters chanted: “Stop all violence. Peace and love come to Hong Kong.” Mike Tsang, 23, a recent graduate, said: “We are coming here to show the police we won’t give up.”Nearby another group was sorting bags of helmets, face masks and other supplies, and trying to find places around the city to hide the items for when the protesters return. “Today we are safe,” said one of the protesters.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. In Tamar Park, another group was organising stations for food and water, first aid, and legal advice from social workers. A group of secondary students had come directly from school to bring snacks and fruit to the protesters, who planned to stay there until midnight. Some would camp overnight to keep watch over the supplies.Some worried that the postponement of the debate was a ruse to throw off demonstrators. A group of university students huddled in a shopping mall near the government buildings, texting contacts to mobilise a group to gather outside the Legislative Council and block any lawmakers in favour of the bill from entering.“Our only chance is to stop the lawmakers from coming in,” said Jason Fong, 19, who said lawmakers could go in on Thursday, stay overnight and hold the reading of the bill on Friday.The crackdown on the protests represented an escalation of police action against demonstrators. Pictures and videos on social media showed police firing rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds from shotguns, teargassing protesters and beating some with batons.Man-kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said: “This excessive response from police is fuelling tensions and is likely to contribute to worsening violence, rather than end it.”Two protesters treated in hospital were arrested, according to local media. Protesters have been obscuring their faces with masks and using encrypted messaging platforms.On Wednesday as police were clearing protests, the messaging service Telegram posted on Twitter that it was facing a “powerful DDos attack”, referring to a distributed denial of service attack, that originated in China.Despite the wave of opposition, Lam remains determined to put the bill to a vote, which would be likely to pass because of the dominance of pro-Beijing lawmakers in the legislature. Speaking on Wednesday evening, Lam said: “If I let him have his way every time my son acted like that, such as when he didn’t want to study, things might be OK between us in the short term. But if I indulge his wayward behaviour, he might regret it when he grows up. He will then ask me: ‘Mum, why didn’t you call me up on that back then?’” she said.Through tears, Carrie Lam says that she did not sell out #HongKong and that she believes the government has been doing the right thing all along. https://t.co/3Q6rl13yK8 pic.twitter.com/UQjhC0CsrfLam has the support of Beijing. In an an English-language editorial, the state-run China Daily blamed “the opposition camp and its foreign masters” for riling up residents. “It is lawlessness that will hurt Hong Kong, not the proposed amendments to its fugitive law,” it said.The demonstrators disagree, pointing to the sense of community and collaboration fostered. Yau Wai Ping, an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University who was participating in a hunger strike, said: “The protest is bringing people together. The bill affects us all.”She added: “We don’t know whether we are going to achieve what we set out to, but long-term I am quite optimistic. So many positive things have come out of this. Long-term it will be the beginning of a new era, of the kind of community and civil society we want to make.”",Hong Kong protests: activists call for further action,2019-06-13/10:40:19,activists in

"Activists in Hong Kong have called for a march on Sunday and a boycott of work and classes on Monday in protest against an extradition bill that could result in suspects being sent to mainland China.On Thursday, a day after a demonstration by thousands of people was violently cleared, a group of pro-democracy politicians and activists tried to march on the residence of Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, but were stopped by police.“We need to come out in unity. We call on all demonstrators. We can win if all of us come out,” said Lee Cheuk-yan, a politician and activist, condemning the police and Lam, who has been pushing the bill.Debate in the Legislative Council over the bill was postponed again on Thursday. The proposed law, which critics say Beijing could use to target political enemies in Hong Kong, has brought up to a million people on to the streets to protest. Beijing and Hong Kong authorities insist the law is aimed at combating crime.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongDemonstrators and observers were shocked by the violence of Wednesday, when police charged on protesters, firing rubber bullets and teargas. At least 72 people were taken to hospital, two of whom were in a serious condition.“Emotionally, it’s devastating,” said Yoyo Chan, who has been staging a hunger strike and sit-in on a path just outside the government headquarters. After the protests were cleared on Wednesday, she went to help clean up rubbish left on the streets and found a backpack abandoned by a protester – a young girl, according to her ID card left behind.“She’s so young. [The protesters] are so hopeful and just want to help the city. The way they were oppressed yesterday, it’s heartbreaking,” Chan said.The city was slowly returning to normal after a shutdown on Wednesday. By Thursday morning main traffic arteries had been reopened and evidence of the protests – piles of broken goggles, bottles and umbrellas – had been shunted to the side of the road. Dozens of police patrolled the central Hong Kong area. Several shops in a mall near the site of the protests were shut.The mood was mostly upbeat on Thursday as dispersed groups of demonstrators organised supplies, cleaned up litter and chatted. In Tamar Park, outside the Legislative Council building where lawmakers will debate the proposed bill, a circle of demonstrators were singing worship songs accompanied by a saxophonist.Others were more defiant. A few dozen protesters on an overpass leading into the government complex faced off with police blocking their way. The group stood in silence, holding up laminated signs that said “Retract” and “Go Hong Kong”.Later in the day a new group arrived and held signs that said “Stop police brutality”. Secondary school students held signs up to the police that said “Stop shooting Hong Kong students”. One group of protesters chanted: “Stop all violence. Peace and love come to Hong Kong.” Mike Tsang, 23, a recent graduate, said: “We are coming here to show the police we won’t give up.”Nearby another group was sorting bags of helmets, face masks and other supplies, and trying to find places around the city to hide the items for when the protesters return. “Today we are safe,” said one of the protesters.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. In Tamar Park, another group was organising stations for food and water, first aid, and legal advice from social workers. A group of secondary students had come directly from school to bring snacks and fruit to the protesters, who planned to stay there until midnight. Some would camp overnight to keep watch over the supplies.Some worried that the postponement of the debate was a ruse to throw off demonstrators. A group of university students huddled in a shopping mall near the government buildings, texting contacts to mobilise a group to gather outside the Legislative Council and block any lawmakers in favour of the bill from entering.“Our only chance is to stop the lawmakers from coming in,” said Jason Fong, 19, who said lawmakers could go in on Thursday, stay overnight and hold the reading of the bill on Friday.The crackdown on the protests represented an escalation of police action against demonstrators. Pictures and videos on social media showed police firing rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds from shotguns, teargassing protesters and beating some with batons.Man-kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said: “This excessive response from police is fuelling tensions and is likely to contribute to worsening violence, rather than end it.”Two protesters treated in hospital were arrested, according to local media. Protesters have been obscuring their faces with masks and using encrypted messaging platforms.On Wednesday as police were clearing protests, the messaging service Telegram posted on Twitter that it was facing a “powerful DDos attack”, referring to a distributed denial of service attack, that originated in China.Despite the wave of opposition, Lam remains determined to put the bill to a vote, which would be likely to pass because of the dominance of pro-Beijing lawmakers in the legislature. Speaking on Wednesday evening, Lam said: “If I let him have his way every time my son acted like that, such as when he didn’t want to study, things might be OK between us in the short term. But if I indulge his wayward behaviour, he might regret it when he grows up. He will then ask me: ‘Mum, why didn’t you call me up on that back then?’” she said.Through tears, Carrie Lam says that she did not sell out #HongKong and that she believes the government has been doing the right thing all along. https://t.co/3Q6rl13yK8 pic.twitter.com/UQjhC0CsrfLam has the support of Beijing. In an an English-language editorial, the state-run China Daily blamed “the opposition camp and its foreign masters” for riling up residents. “It is lawlessness that will hurt Hong Kong, not the proposed amendments to its fugitive law,” it said.The demonstrators disagree, pointing to the sense of community and collaboration fostered. Yau Wai Ping, an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University who was participating in a hunger strike, said: “The protest is bringing people together. The bill affects us all.”She added: “We don’t know whether we are going to achieve what we set out to, but long-term I am quite optimistic. So many positive things have come out of this.

"On Tuesday evening Ines Wong gathered seven pieces of cardboard, attached to them colourful sticky labels with messages demanding the Hong Kong government retract a controversial extradition bill, and placed the notes under a busy footbridge in Kowloon Bay.There, dozens of passersby helped themselves to the labels, wrote their own messages and put those on the “Lennon wall”, a form of protest inspired by anti-communist activists in 1980s Prague.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong“Before, we have occupied roads and held rallies but we were told we were in the way of other people doing business,” said Wong, 24, who works as a florist. “So this is the most peaceful, unobstructive, way to express ourselves. It is not in anyone’s way.”After a turbulent month of protests and rallies joined by millions to fight against a proposed law that would allow individuals to be extradited to stand trial in China’s courts, more “Lennon walls” have emerged across the city this week, including in some unlikely suburban neighbourhoods such as the politically conservative Tai Po, Sha Tin and Tsuen Wan districts in the New Territories.The walls have their roots in the 2014 civil disobedience “umbrella movement”, when protesters decorated the wall next to a staircase near the legislature building with colourful collages of sticky labels of support and encouragement to each other. The Lennon wall was inspired by the original graffiti-decorated wall in Prague dedicated to John Lennon; by the late 1980s it had become a source of irritation for the communist regime on account of its many critical messages.To keep up the spirit of the anti-extradition bill campaign, Hong Kong protesters have now created “Lennon walls” on any available space, including on pillars outside underground railway stations, in underground tunnels,and on footbridges.“We Hong Kongers never give up!”, “The Hong Kong spirit will never die!” , “Where there is suppression there is resistance!” say some of the messages across the city.Many protesters who are unsure about their next step say the messages are a way of showing that they will continue the fight. They have been experimenting with creative ways of demonstrating against the extradition bill and demanding democracy. But the hours-long occupation of the tax office and immigration buildings last month proved to be unpopular with citizens.“Only when the messages are everywhere would people know we are still here,” said a young man who had helped create a Lennon wall on a footbridge in downtown Causeway Bay. “It’s a way of expressing ourselves under an authoritarian regime.”The wave of protests which started on 9 June forced the government to suspend the bill and Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, said this week that the legislation was effectively “dead”. But the protesters were not reassured by her personal promise, which they said was no guarantee that the bill would not be revived later.They continue to demand that the government fully withdraws the bill, releases all those arrested in protests and launches an independent investigation into police use of teargas, rubber bullets and truncheons on largely peaceful crowds.The emergence of Lennon walls across the city came a week after the storming and vandalising of the parliament building on 1 July, also the anniversary of Hong Kong’s 1997 return to Chinese rule. The government has strongly condemned the protesters’ actions.Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said the Lennon walls, which she viewed as installation art, were “the best outlets for our young to vent the anger and resentment in a peaceful manner” and were “effective reminders of the governance crisis”.But even this mild form of protest has attracted the ire of government supporters and stirred unease among the authorities. Local media reported that on Wednesday morning more than 200 police officers, some armed with shields, descended on a Lennon wall in Tai Po, where some messages supposedly exposed some police officers’ personal details.Around the same time a man punched two people guarding a Lennon wall in a pedestrian walkway in Kowloon Bay , and later that night hundreds staged a noisy rally outside the Yau Tong underground station in Kowloon late after several students guarding a local Lennon wall were assaulted by unknown attackers. At one point during the impromptu rally people swiftly passed round sticky labels, wrote on them and stuck them on to nearby pillars.",Hong Kong's Lennon walls: protest goes on in colourful collages

protesters decorated the wall next to a staircase near the legislature building with colourful collages of sticky labels of support and encouragement to each other the lennon wall was inspired by the original graffiti decorated wall in prague dedicated to john lennon by the late s it had become a source of irritation for the communist regime on account of its many critical messages to keep up the spirit of the anti extradition bill campaign hong kong protesters have now created lennon walls on any available space including on pillars outside underground railway stations in underground tunnels and on footbridges we hong kongers never give up the hong kong spirit will never die where there is suppression there is resistance say some of the messages across the city many protesters who are unsure about their next step say the messages are a way of showing that they will continue the fight they have been experimenting with creative ways of demonstrating against the extradition bill and demanding democracy but the hours long occupation of the tax office and immigration buildings last month proved to be unpopular with citizens only when the messages are everywhere would people know we are still here said a young man who had helped create a lennon wall on a footbridge in downtown causeway bay it s a way of expressing ourselves under an authoritarian regime the wave of protests which started on  june forced the government to suspend the bill and hong kong s leader carrie lam said this week that the legislation was effectively dead but the protesters were not reassured by her personal promise which they said was no guarantee that the bill would not be revived later they continue to demand that the government fully withdraws the bill releases all those arrested in protests

storming and vandalising of the parliament building on  july also the anniversary of hong kong s  return to chinese rule the government has strongly condemned the protesters actions claudia mo a pro democracy lawmaker said the lennon walls which she viewed as installation art were the best outlets for our young to vent the anger and resentment in a peaceful manner and were effective reminders of the governance crisis but even this mild form of protest has attracted the ire of government supporters and stirred unease among the authorities local media reported that on wednesday morning more

"Thousands of civil servants in Hong Kong have protested against the government in a rare display of defiance as the city braces for four consecutive days of mass demonstrations.The public servants, who are normally politically neutral, defied a government order to remain “totally loyal” to Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, and crowded into a public park near government offices.An hour after the event had started, people were still streaming into the park, many dressed in black and some in masks to conceal their identity.Cheung Ka-po, one of the organisers of the rally, told the crowd: “In the face of right and wrong, if we stay silent we betray our duty.” The crowd yelled: “Hong Kong people, go! Hong Kong civil servants, go!”In a separate rally, hundreds of medical workers called for the release of a nurse who was arrested for tending to protesters hurt in clashes with police.Large-scale protests are planned for Saturday and Sunday and a citywide strike has been called for Monday. It will be the ninth weekend in a row of anti-government protests.On Thursday night riot police raided an industrial building in Sha Tin, in Hong Kong’s New Territories, and found protective gear including helmets, gas masks, kneepads and arm braces, as well as “offensive weapons” including petrol bombs, hiking poles, baseball bats and a rattan cane.Seven men and one woman between the ages of 24 and 31 were arrested. They included Andy Chan, the founder of the Hong Kong National party, which was banned last year. Dozens of protesters surrounded local police stations from Thursday night into Friday morning, chanting: “Free the martyrs!” In a separate operation, a family of three were detained on suspicion of possessing explosives after police raided an apartment and seized partially made smoke bombs.Police also said on Friday that another seven men had been arrested for unlawful assembly connected to the Yuen Long attack on 21 July, bringing the total to 19. None have yet been charged.Forty-four protesters have been charged with rioting, a crime that carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Critics say authorities are using harsher measures in an attempt to intimidate demonstrators.The political crisis in Hong Kong has deepened in the past few weeks after almost two months of protests that began over an extradition bill that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China. The focus has now turned to the authorities and the police after the attack on commuters by suspected triad members in Yuen Long.Beijing has intensified its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. On Thursday China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.On Friday Xie Feng, the commissioner for the foreign ministry in Hong Kong, called on foreign forces to “withdraw their black hands” and stop interfering with “China’s internal affairs”.Donald Trump has abstained from commenting directly on the demonstrations, referring to them as “riots”, using language also employed by Beijing to describe the mass protests, many of which have been peaceful.“Somebody said that at some point they’re going to want to stop that,” the US president told reporters, referring to China’s potential response to the crisis. “But that’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China.”",Hong Kong civil servants protest in defiance of loyalty order,2019-08-02/14:11:36,thousands of civil servants in hong kong have protested against the government in a rare display of defiance as the city braces for four consecutive days of mass demonstrations the public servants who are normally politically neutral defied a government order to remain totally loyal to hong kong s leader carrie lam and crowded into a public park near government offices an hour after the event had started people were still streaming into the park many dressed in black and some in masks to conceal their identity cheung ka po one of the organisers of the rally told the crowd in the face of right and wrong if we stay silent we betray our duty the crowd yelled hong kong people go hong kong civil servants go in a separate rally hundreds of medical workers called for the release of a nurse who was arrested for tending to protesters hurt in clashes with police large scale protests are planned for saturday and sunday and a citywide strike has been called for monday it will be the ninth weekend in a row of anti government protests on thursday night riot police raided an industrial building in sha tin in hong kong s new territories and found protective gear including helmets gas masks kneepads and arm braces as well as offensive weapons including petrol bombs hiking poles baseball bats and a rattan cane seven men and one woman between the ages of  and  were arrested they included andy chan the founder of the hong kong national party which was banned last year dozens of protesters surrounded local police stations from thursday night into friday morning chanting free the martyrs in a separate operation a family of three were detained on suspicion of possessing explosives after police raided an apartment and seized partially made smoke bombs police also said on friday that another seven men had been arrested for unlawful assembly connected to the yuen long attack on  july bringing the total to  none have yet been charged forty four protesters have been charged with rioting a crime that carries a penalty of up to  years in prison critics say authorities are using harsher measures in an attempt to intimidate demonstrators the political crisis in hong kong has deepened in the past few weeks after almost two months of protests that began over an extradition bill that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland china the focus has now turned to the authorities and the police after the attack on commuters by suspected triad members in yuen long beijing has intensified its accusations that foreign countries are fanning the fire of unrest in the city on thursday china s top diplomat yang jiechi ordered the us to immediately stop interfering in hong kong affairs in any form on friday xie feng the commissioner for the foreign ministry in hong kong called on foreign forces to withdraw their black hands and stop interfering with china s internal affairs donald trump has abstained from commenting directly on the demonstrations referring to them as riots using language also employed by beijing to describe the mass protests many of which have been peaceful somebody said that at some point they re going to want to stop that the us president told reporters referring to china s potential response to the crisis but that s between hong kong and that s between china because hong kong is a part of china ,Hong Kong Protests,0.288361222
"In Hong Kong, people have most of the freedoms of a democracy except the right to choose their leaders. The city’s last British governor, Chris Patten, described it as a place that enjoyed “liberty without democracy”.That has made protests particularly important as a political tool and an expression of Hong Kong identity. For more than half a century, the people of Hong Kong have been taking to the streets to force distant authorities – first in Britain and later in Beijing – to reconsider how they govern the city.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongThis week’s mass demonstrations, over plans for a new extradition law that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, is part of that long tradition. And many say they are demonstrating precisely to protect it.“If this bill passes, we won’t have the right to protest any more. It’s a key part of Hong Kong culture,” said Jason Fong, 19, who has joined the demonstrations with his high school friends.According to Antony Dapiran, author of City of Protest, a history of dissent in the territory, the first major demonstrations in modern Hong Kong came in 1966 and 1967. People took to the streets initially over a planned hike to the price of ferry tickets between Hong Kong island and the mainland, but “the Star Ferry riots” led to broader protests about labour rights and living conditions.In 1967, more demonstrations turned violent on both sides, with protesters using homemade bombs and the police harsh crowd-control tactics. Dozens were killed in the worst protest bloodshed the city has ever seen, but the demonstrations had a huge impact on the lives of ordinary Hong Kong residents.“The colonial administration of the time realised they had to start paying more attention to the welfare of the local population,” Dapiran said. “It instituted various reforms including housing, compulsory education and labour rights.”In the 1970s, protests against a corrupt police chief brought government action on graft. At the end of the 1980s, the Chinese government’s brutal crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square made Hong Kong’s right to protest seem even more important.Memorial gatherings each year still draw large crowds, particularly for milestones such as this year’s 30th anniversary. “It’s the only place in China territory where it is commemorated on a large scale, and that in itself is interesting and important,” Dapiran said.“Originally the reason for the [demonstration] was to protest for democracy in China. Now it is more to commemorate and bear witness, and as an expression of Hong Kong identity, that we as Hong Kongers are different and going to exercise this right.”After Hong Kong was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997, with promises that it would be self-governing under a mechanism known as “one country, two systems”, protests have increasingly focused on protecting Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. Taking to the streets is perhaps particularly important in a city where people have few other outlets for political frustration and grievances. Although there are elections for some seats in the legislature, the system is weighted so people can never choose their own leader.One of the most effective protest movements after the handover to Chinese rule was the 2003 campaign against article 23, a national security law to ban treason, secession, sedition and subversion.Pro-democracy lawmakers and their supporters said it would destroy the territory’s rights and freedoms, and more than half a million people took to the streets to oppose it. Authorities were forced to shelve it indefinitely, and the debacle badly damaged the authority of the first post-handover leader of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa.In 2012, protesters forced the government to make a U-turn over plans to bring in a compulsory national curriculum, which opponents criticised as brainwashing. Those demonstrations helped forge new leaders including the schoolboy activist Joshua Wong, but they may also have alarmed authorities in Beijing.As President Xi Jinping tightened control of Chinese society, cracking down on campaigners and presiding over widely criticised mass detentions and surveillance in western Xinjiang, Hong Kong authorities have also taken a stronger line on dissent.The 2014 umbrella protests calling for genuine democracy in the colony were firmly crushed, albeit after more than two months, and prominent leaders and organisers were pursued through the courts.“Beijing wouldn’t want Hong Kongers to get into the habit of thinking they can get results from protests,” said Dapiran.Despite the determination of protesters stockpiling supplies on Thursday in preparation for more demonstrations, few analysts expect the government to bow to the crowds over the new extradition law.“The Hong Kong government seems intent to ramp up rather than back down in its efforts to undermine the city’s autonomy in face of huge public protests,” said Human Rights Watch’s senior China researcher Maya Wang.

"An estimated 1.7 million people in Hong Kong – a quarter of the population – defied police orders to stage a peaceful march after a rally in a downtown park, after two months of increasingly violent clashes that have prompted severe warnings from Beijing and failed to win concessions from the city’s government.Huge crowds filled Victoria Park on Sunday afternoon and spilled on to nearby streets, forcing police to block traffic in the area. Torrential rain came down an hour into the rally, turning the park into a sea of umbrellas. At the same time, protesters walked towards Central, the heart of Hong Kong’s business district, and surrounded government headquarters.Police had turned down a plan for Sunday’s march submitted by the Civil Human Rights Front group and gave permission only for a rally in the park. Those defying the ban risked being charged with unlawful assembly, which can lead to up to five years in prison.“Stand with Hong Kong! Fight for freedom!” protesters shouted at the rally.Throughout the afternoon, streets around Victoria Park were so densely packed that the march frequently came to a complete standstill. Some protesters walked on to a flyover near the park as the crowds on the streets were unable to move.Protesters were orderly but burst into choruses of slogans as they waited to move forward. “Hong Kong people, go!”, “Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our era!” they chanted.Observers saw Sunday’s rally, the largest in weeks, as a test of the movement’s momentum and public support as tensions between police and protesters have escalated.“Even though the weather was so bad, even in the face of threats of the People’s Liberation Army and water cannons, Hong Kong people never back down,” said Wong, 21, a university student.Wong did not expect this to be the last major rally. “For as long as the government doesn’t respond, there will only be more large-scale protests.”US president Donald Trump said on Sunday he wanted to see the crisis resolved peacefully, warning against any hardline crackdown.“I’d like to see Hong Kong worked out in a very humanitarian fashion … I hope [Chinese] President Xi can do it… he sure has the ability, I can tell you that.“I think it’d be very hard to deal if they do violence, I mean, if it’s another Tiananmen Square,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey. “I think it’s a very hard thing to do if there’s violence.”Organisers of the rally, who estimated that 1.7 million people turned up at the park and in the nearby Causeway Bay and Tin Hau areas, said many more were unable to get there. Train services to the metro stations near the park were suspended intermittently throughout the day due to the huge numbers of people.The crowd was a mix of young protesters, families and elderly residents. Parents walked alongside small children.By early evening, protesters occupied a six-lane road outside the government in Admiralty, shining lasers at the building and the nearby People’s Liberation Army garrison and yelling insults at the police. After convoys of police vans were seen entering the government complex, protesters called for a retreat and the crowd gradually dispersed. A statement from the force late on Sunday condemned the protesters and accused them of paralysing traffic in the area.As protesters marched past the police headquarters, they chanted, “Return the eye!” referring to a recent incident in which a young woman’s eye was badly injured during the protests. Both the government and police headquarters were surrounded by giant water-filled barricades.In the early evening, a number of protesters ignored the organisers’ advice to leave after reaching Central and continued to march west towards the Chinese government’s liaison office, where previous protests have ended in violent clashes. Dozens of riot police officers armed with shields and guns were seen patrolling the area.Organisers insist that the Hong Kong government must stop using the police force to suppress them and respond to their five political demands, including the complete withdrawal of the now suspended extradition bill – under which individuals can be sent to China for trial – the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence, and universal suffrage (the free election of Hong Kong’s leaders).A late-night government statement said although the protests were peaceful, they caused inconvenience to the community. The statement said it was “most important” to restore social order and “the government will begin sincere dialogue with the public, mend social rifts and rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down”.The Civil Human Rights Front had earlier called for a “peaceful, rational and non-violent” rally and online posts urged “self discipline and calmness” after 10 weeks of intensive protests, many of which have ended in violent clashes as police increasingly employed teargas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds.“China is taking over Hong Kong. Our society has no justice and no future. We’re just making a last-ditch attempt to do something amid our despondency,” said Carol Lui, a teacher in her 30s. “Hong Kong is dying anyway, so we are just fighting to our last breath.”Hong Kong had its first teargas-free Saturday for weeks after three separate rallies took place in Kowloon. The marches this Saturday and Sunday marked the 11th weekend of protests in Hong Kong.Tensions reached a new level during the past week. Following last weekend’s violent clashes with police, protesters occupied Hong Kong’s airport. Over the past week, state media outlets have published videos showing armoured Chinese troop carriers purportedly driving into Shenzhen, the south-eastern state that borders Hong Kong.Chinese officials have also released a series of threatening statements about Hong Kong’s protesters, with one claiming “terrorism” was emerging in the city after flights were cancelled.Despite the call for peace on Sunday, some protesters have warned that the protests could turn violent again if the government continues to ignore their demands.“Violent escalation is an extreme measure … but if it is effective, we would continue, because we need to try all means to attract attention to our cause,” said a 25-year-old engineer wearing full protective gear who gave his surname as Fan.Janice Hui and

"Flights have resumed in and out of Hong Kong airport after two days of protests by pro-democracy activists as Chinese officials condemned the disruption that paralysed the international hub as “near-terrorist acts”.Hundreds of flights were cancelled on Tuesday after demonstrators blockaded two terminals in the latest escalation of a 10-week political crisis that has gripped the city.But by Wednesday only a few dozen protesters remained at the airport in a sanctioned area after the airport authority obtained an interim injunction against demonstrators. The previous night, protesters had blocked travellers from checking into their flights, clashed with police, and tied down two men that demonstrators suspected of being spies.The airport’s website showed dozens of flights taking off overnight and listed hundreds more which were scheduled to depart throughout the day, although many were cancelled or delayed. Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific said it has cancelled 272 flights in the last two days.As the airport struggled to returned to normal on Wednesday, protesters gathered at the airport, bowing their heads to passengers and holding signs apologising for their behaviour. “Sorry for the inconvenience. We are fighting for the future of our home”, read one banner.The sixth consecutive day of demonstrations at the airport came as Beijing stepped up its war of words against the protesters. China’s Hong Kong and Macao affairs office said in a statement that the airport protests were “near-terrorist acts”. It also strongly condemned attacks against a reporter from China’s Global Times newspaper at the airport by what it said were violent protesters.The ruling Communist party’s official People’s Daily newspaper said on Wednesday that Hong Kong had reached a critical juncture.“Using the sword of the law to stop violence and restore order is overwhelmingly the most important and urgent task for Hong Kong!” it said. Another commentary by a Shenzhen University researcher, published by the China Daily, said the central government should deal with Hong Kong issues more decisively.Hong Kong’s Airport Authority said on Wednesday it had obtained an interim injunction against protesters – meaning if they do return they could face arrest or forced removal by police. The order said that anyone found “inciting, aiding or abetting” obstruction of the airport as well as roads and passageways near it would be deemed in violation.A similar action was taken against protesters in the last weeks of 2014’s Umbrella Movement democracy protests, clearing the way for police to remove protesters from a sit-in.On Wednesday, pro-Beijing lawmakers said protesters had crossed a moral bottom line, echoing recent statements by Beijing that signs of “terrorism” were emerging in Hong Kong.Protesters appeared to be engaged in soul searching over the previous day’s clashes. Online demonstrators debated how and when to apologise to the public, while some drafted a code of conduct that included a rule not to “just attack” people suspected of being moles.“Yesterday the protesters went too far,” said Biyanca Chu, a protester who was at the airport. Chu said protesters were trying to remind their colleagues not to resort to violence. “Don’t let hatred consume any of us,” she said, quoting a poster circulating online on Wednesday.On Tuesday night, protesters battled with riot police armed with pepper spray and batons outside the terminal. In one of several flash points, demonstrators overpowered an armed officer who had forced a woman to the ground, taking his baton. The officer drew his pistol and aiming at protesters, who quickly fled, according to footage shared on social media.Protesters also held a man at the airport on suspicion of being a spy. He was identified by the nationalistic Chinese newspaper Global Times as their reporter and later released. Earlier, crowds had tied down a man believed to be an undercover policeman and prevented paramedics from him for several hours, even as he collapsed.Police condemned the protesters overnight and said on Wednesday morning that a large group had “harassed and assaulted a visitor and a journalist”. Five people were detained, bringing the total number of people arrested since the protests began in June to more than 600, police said.The Hang Seng stock index fell to a seven-month low on Tuesday and embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the city had been pushed into a state of “panic and chaos”.Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests are a leaderless movement that has managed to mobilise large crowds through social media and messaging apps.Activists turned their attention to the economically vital airport after weeks of huge peaceful rallies – and increasingly violent clashes between hardliners and police – failed to win any concessions from the city’s leaders or Beijing.Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the situation in Hong Kong was tricky, but he hoped it would be resolved “for liberty” without anyone getting hurt or killed.The US president cited intelligence as saying that China’s government was moving troops to its border with Hong Kong, and urged calm after the airport clashes.It was not immediately clear whether Trump was reporting fresh troop movements or movements near the border already reported in the media. “Our intelligence has informed us that the Chinese government is moving troops to the border with Hong Kong.

"At the end of pro-democracy protests that paralysed central Hong Kong for 79 days in 2014, demonstrators left behind glitter bombs and stickers with the outline of an umbrella and the message: “We’ll be back.”More than four years later, they have made good on that promise. Since Tuesday evening, thousands of protesters have poured into the streets, surrounding their government. They blocked roads, built barricades, and occupied many of the same areas that were under siege during the Occupy protests, also known as the “umbrella movement”, a campaign for “genuine democracy” in elections. Like in 2014, they have clashed with riot police and suffered rounds of teargas.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongBut Occupy 2.0, as the latest protests have been called, is different in key ways. Today’s protesters are a lot less idealistic and a lot more cynical. And they are pushing for a specific goal: the cancelling of a proposed extradition bill that would allow Beijing to extradite alleged criminals from Hong Kong, a territory of China that is meant to operate with a high degree of autonomy with its own legal and judicial system, a free press, and unfettered internet.China says the new law is to combat crime and will not be used for political ends. But critics say it will amount to the “legalised abduction” of activists, dissidents, and other critics of the Chinese regime, for whom Hong Kong has long been a base.Over the past four years since the umbrella protests ended, the Hong Kong government has jailed activists, disqualified elected pro-democracy lawmakers, and constructed expensive infrastructure physically linking Hong Kong more closely to the mainland, while Chinese security has abducted independent booksellers in the territory.“This is basically an accumulation of pent-up anger now boiling over,” said Victoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at Notre Dame University in the US, who follows Hong Kong politics. “It’s not just about this [law]. It’s the combination of all the things Beijing has done to erode Hong Kong’s freedom.”Support for the protests may be broader than it was in 2014. Hundreds of businesses, as well as teachers and parents across the city, boycotted work and class on Wednesday. On Sunday, an estimated 1 million marched against the bill, which is opposed by lawyers, judges, investment bankers and churches. Many have described the fight against the extradition bill as the city’s “last battle” for its freedom and distinct identity from China.In some ways, Hong Kong’s protesters today are better equipped. On Tuesday night and Wednesday ahead of a morning debate in the legislature over the bill, they mobilised supplies – food, water, first aid kit, as well as face masks and umbrellas to shield against teargas – and passed them to those at the frontline facing off with police. Seeing protesters surrounding the government complex, officials postponed the meeting, marking a win for the demonstrators.The authorities are more savvy now too. Wary of allowing protesters to dig in and occupy the city centre again, police have acted earlier and more forcefully: charging, teargassing, and firing rubber bullets. Angry protesters threw construction materials at police and jeered at them. In at least one case, according to videos posted online, police beat a protester with batons. Broadcaster RTHK reported that 72 had been taken to hospital, two of them in a serious condition. Police succeeded in clearing protesters from the areas around the legislative complex.Today, both Hong Kongers and the international community have hardened in their views of Beijing, which remains locked in disputes with the US and other countries over trade, Huawei, and human rights. The extradition bill is exacerbating those tensions.The US, the UK, Canada and others have all criticised the extradition bill and Beijing has in response blamed “foreign forces” for misleading Hong Kongers and attempting to destabilise China. Before the march in Hong Kong, several foreign news sites, including the Guardian, several US publications and the Toronto Star were blocked in mainland China.In Hong Kong, despite the outpouring of opposition, few believe the bill will actually be shelved. Beijing has reiterated its support for the law and Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has pledged that she will continue to push it forward.“Even when people power cannot stop the bill, they want to show to the world, Carrie Lam, Beijing … that we care, that we won’t go down without a fight,” said Hui.",Street protesters dig in for Hong Kong's 'last battle',2019-06-12/18:09:55,at the end

"Riot police have used rubber bullets, batons and teargas against people in Hong Kong protesting against a controversial extradition bill that would tighten Beijing’s grip on the semi-autonomous territory.Unable to drive away the crowds paralysing the central business district on Wednesday, authorities were forced to delay a debate over the bill that would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent for trial in mainland China.Protesters worry Beijing will exploit the law to extradite political opponents and activists to the mainland, where they would be subject to a Chinese justice system criticised by human rights activists.The violence marked an escalation in the biggest political crisis to hit the city in years. After the police crackdown, a group of protesters made a failed attempt to storm government offices. In several cases, crowds charged at armed officers, throwing bottles and other debris.Hospital authorities told broadcaster RTHK that 72 people had been taken to hospital and two were in a serious condition. Pictures and videos on social media appeared to show people wounded by rubber bullets or bean-bag rounds, which police fired from shotguns.Demonstrators shut down the main thoroughfare and streets near the legislature, refusing to leave until the authorities retracted the bill. The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office.

China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongThe police chief, Stephen Lo, described the protest as a “riot situation” and claimed officers needed to protect themselves or “protesters would have used metal bars to stab our colleagues”.The mass gatherings began on Sunday with a march that drew hundreds of thousands of people, and have remained largely non-violent. Asked if the police would ask the Chinese army to help, Lo said: “Definitely not, at this stage.”Beijing reiterated its support for the extradition law at a press briefing and called rumours that the government would call in the military to clear protests “misinformation”.On the streets of Hong Kong, police held up black banners warning they were prepared to use force. Water cannon was also used against the crowd earlier in the day. “The government just wants to scare the young people [by shooting teargas],” a protester, Wong Shan, 80, said. “Some police were even holding rifles. Unlike the 1967 riot, nobody is wrecking shops. They are just voicing their opinions,” he added, referring to riots against British rule in the former colony.“Hong Kong has become a dangerous place,” said Freeman Yim, 36, a construction worker. “You can just imagine what Hong Kong will become once the law comes in. Everyone has come out, whatever sector they belong to.”The Hong Kong legislature’s chair, Andrew Leung, planned to limit debate on the extradition bill to 61 hours, meaning it could be put to a vote on 20 June. The chamber is dominated by pro-Beijing politicians, making it almost certain the bill will pass.Protesters fear that civil rights and freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kong under the “one country, two systems” arrangement, made after Britain returned the colony to China in 1997, will be quickly eroded under the new law. China often uses non-political crimes to prosecute its critics. The UK prime minister, Theresa May, said it was vital that any new extradition treaty did not violate rights agreed after the British withdrawal, which allowed the territory to maintain a semi-independent local government.“We are concerned about the potential effects of these proposals, particularly obviously given the large number of British citizens there are in Hong Kong,” she said. One protester, a 55-year-old lab technician who gave his name only as Chan, said: “We don’t trust China. Rules and laws can be arbitrarily applied and we can see this in Hong Kong already.” He cited the recent disqualifications of pro-democracy politicians and jailing of the leaders of the 2014 Occupy Central movement.Observers have started to call this week’s demonstrations Occupy 2.0, a reference to 79 days of demonstrations that paralysed the city in 2014, also known as the “umbrella movement”. 1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. Holding up a sign that read: “Scrap China extradition bill”, the pro-democracy politician Claudia Mo said to a cheering crowd: “At the end of the umbrella movement didn’t we say we would be back? Now we are back!”The latest demonstrations began on Tuesday night after an online petition called for 50,000 people to gather from 10pm on Tuesday. Many camped overnight. Hundreds of businesses closed on Wednesday, and thousands of parents and teachers called for a boycott of work and classes to show their opposition to the proposed bill.Footage taken by Verna Yu of the fresh protests outside LegCo in Hong Kong over the extradition bill pic.twitter.com/Oi76FxJzHSStudent unions of seven universities and colleges also said they would boycott classes. Several churches said they would hold meetings to pray for the city’s leadership and peace for Hong Kong.The Hong Kong aviation industry gathered 1,700 employees’ signatures to demand its union initiate a strike while the union of the New World First Bus company condemned the government for ignoring citizens’ voices and urged drivers to drive slowly on Wednesday. The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, which has 190,000 members, also urged its members to stay off work for the day.Despite the outpouring of opposition Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said she remained determined to pass the law.In a tearful Wednesday morning interview, Lam denied she was “selling out Hong Kong” to Beijing, as protesters have claimed. “I have grown up here with all the Hong Kong people,” she told the broadcaster TVB. “My love for this place has led me to make many personal sacrifices.”Official Chinese media did not report on the protests on Wednesday and mentions of the protests were scrubbed from Chinese social media platforms. The search term “Let’s go, Hong Kong” or Xianggang jiayou was blocked on the microblogging site Weibo.Supporters of the bill say it will apply only to those involved in serious crimes, while Beijing has claimed that opposition leaders and “foreign forces” have misled the public.Early on Thursday morning a few protesters were still hanging on. Some were starting to clean up plastic water bottles, face masks, zip ties and other remnants of the protests left behind after police cleared most occupied areas.

He said he had been there for three or four hours since the group retreated from areas around the government complex.“If they pass this law, we won’t be able to protest any more.

"A leaked audio recording has emerged in which Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, can be heard saying she would quit if she had “a choice” but suggesting she was being prevented from doing so by authorities in Beijing.In the recording, obtained by Reuters, the Hong Kong chief executive told a group of businesspeople in a closed-door meeting last week she was “very, very limited” in how her government could respond to the mass protests that began in June over a proposal to allow extradition to mainland China.“For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable. If I have a choice, the first thing [I would do] is to quit, having made a deep apology,” Lam said, her voice breaking with emotion. “So I make a plea to you for your forgiveness.”The remarks further demonstrate that it is Beijing rather than Lam directing the government’s response to a political crisis that has threatened China’s authority over the city, as protesters continue to take to the streets pressing for the extradition bill to be withdrawn and calling for universal suffrage.Clashes continued on Monday night when police fired teargas to clear protesters in Mong Kok, a commercial and residential area in Kowloon. In the leaked recording, Lam said she was constrained by the fact the situation had reached “a sort of sovereignty and security level” of concern to the Beijing leadership, especially in the midst of “unprecedented tension between the two big economies of the world” – a reference to deteriorating economic and diplomatic ties between the US and China.“The political room for the chief executive who, unfortunately, has to serve two masters by constitution – that is, the central people’s government and the people of Hong Kong – that political room for manoeuvring is very, very, very limited,” she said.As police appear to be cracking down more severely on protesters, resulting in more violent clashes, observers have wondered whether Hong Kong authorities have been ordered to put down the protests before 1 October, when the People’s Republic of China marks its 70th birthday, a national holiday that Beijing would not want to see tarnished.But Lam said Beijing had not imposed a deadline and was willing to wait out the unrest, even at the cost of damaging Hong Kong’s economy. Officials were making special arrangements for a “modest but solemn” 1 October celebration amid expectations of disruption.“I can assure you that Beijing does not have a deadline. They know this will ripple on,” she said. “They are willing to play long, so you have no short-term solution. Hong Kong suffers, you lose tourism, economy, you lose your IPOs and so, but you can’t do much about it.”Lam said there were no plans for China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to be deployed. “My own feeling [of] the pulse and through discussions, [Beijing] has absolutely no plan to send in the PLA.”Lam’s comments came to light on Monday as thousands of university and secondary students in Hong Kong boycotted the first day of the new term , instead holding rallies and facing off against riot police in skirmishes into the night.Thousands of students wearing helmets, goggles and masks – the unofficial uniform of the protesters – filled the grounds of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), holding black banners saying “Boycott for freedom” and periodically shouting “Reclaim Hong Kong”.“If you are not a slave, don’t act like one,” said one speaker, a woman introduced only by her surname, Chiu, from an alumni group, who urged students to remember their rights. A stage behind her featured a saying by Mao Zedong: “A single spark can start a prairie fire.”University students have called for a two-week boycott, while secondary students have vowed to protest for one day a week until demonstrators’ demands are met.In a park across the city, outside of the government’s headquarters, thousands more gathered in solidarity with students for a workers’ rally. In the evening, dozens of protesters gathered outside the garrison for PLA troops stationed in the city.“If we are stopped by their violence, if we are frightened, I think our whole future will be over. It will be one country, one system,” said Phillip Tsoi, 19, who was shining a laser into windows of the PLA complex to antagonise those inside.Hong Kong, a former British colony under Chinese rule since 1997, is meant to enjoy certain freedoms and autonomy under a the “one country, two systems” framework, according to the terms of the handover.Tensions between protesters, who say that promise has been broken, and authorities have escalated dramatically in recent weeks. On Saturday, police fired teargas and water cannons with dye at protesters who threw petrol bombs and lit fires. Police also targeted protesters and commuters in metro stations, beating them with batons. On Sunday, protesters paralysed transport links to Hong Kong airport.On Monday, police said more than 1,000 people had been arrested since the demonstrations began in June, including 159 over the weekend, among them a 13-year-old boy found with two petrol bombs.China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said in a regular news briefing on Monday that the demonstrations in Hong Kong had “completely exceeded the scope of freedom of assembly”. “They have evolved into extreme and violent actions,” he said, reiterating Beijing’s support for the Hong Kong government and police.In an English-language editorial on Sunday, the Xinhua state news agency said: “The end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonise China.”Hong Kong residents say their city feels increasingly like it is under martial law. After the weekend of tense clashes, riot police patrolled railway stations as protesters blocked train doors from closing, causing delays and throwing morning rush hour into chaos. Police were seen arresting at least one group of protesters and searching people on the street. On Monday morning, secondary school students kneeled, held hands and chanted in the rain outside their schools. A typhoon warning had closed many primary schools.

"Riot police have clashed with protesters in Hong Kong after hundreds of thousands of people marched through the streets in a massive demonstration against a proposed extradition law.Critics say the proposed law will allow mainland China to pursue its political opponents in the city, which has traditionally been a safe haven from the Communist party.A largely peaceful scene outside the parliament and government headquarters in the Admiralty business district changed dramatically in the early hours of Monday as police wearing riot gear moved in with batons and pepper spray on protesters who hurled bottles and metal barricades.Earlier on Sunday a sea of people, many wearing white, stretched for almost two miles as they marched from Victoria Park, in the east of Hong Kong island, to the government HQ. Thousands more struggled to board packed public transport from outer Hong Kong and Kowloon on the mainland.After seven hours of marching, organisers estimated that more than 1 million people had taken part, far outstripping a demonstration in 2003 when half that number successfully challenged government plans for tighter national security laws. A police spokesman said they estimated that 240,000 were on the march at its peak.Riot police all over the place in Hong Kong as protests turn violent pic.twitter.com/B4V9ya79KOSmall groups of young protesters had planned to stay outside the government HQ until Wednesday, when the extradition bill is due to have its second reading, but police moved in on them after their permission to protest expired at midnight. Within minutes scenes of chaos unfolded as protesters fought with officers who were soon backed by riot police.An hour or so later riot police moved into clear out the remaining protesters. There was little resistance after the earlier violence, although some pockets of people remained sitting.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongEarlier police had closed metro stations and funnelled people through narrow thoroughfares, prompting accusations that they were deliberately attempting to reduce the scale of the protest. Anger grew and the crowd shouted for police to free up more space as the march came to a dead stop for large sections in stifling heat. Further down the road, crowds jeered at a pro-China broadcast on a large outdoor screen.Riot police have blocked the entrance to LegCo. Two people meditate in front of them. pic.twitter.com/dQFHrxwDPLThe bill creates a system for case-by-case fugitive transfers between semi-autonomous Hong Kong and regions with which it does not already have agreements, including mainland China.Critics say the proposed law would legitimise abductions in the city and subject political opponents and activists to China’s widely criticised judicial system. They fear that a pro-Beijing Hong Kong government would not resist requests of a political nature.Chants and placards targeted Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, who has pushed for the amendments to be passed before July. Rocky Chang, a 59-year-old professor, told Reuters: “This is the endgame for Hong Kong. It is a matter of life or death. That’s why I come. This is an evil law.”A retired lawyer who gave his name only as Anthony said the government had “tried to hoodwink us into agreeing much too quickly with something that has tremendous significance to Hong Kong”. He said the bill posed a huge risk to the rule of law and would not provide Hong Kong’s courts with the ability to provide proper oversight. “And yet our chief executive tries to tell us there is no need to worry, the court is going to protect you,” he said. “What bullshit.”Standing on a overpass at Wan Chai, looking in both directions #HongKong #extraditionbill pic.twitter.com/izAAuI4JWvAnti-Beijing anger has been fuelled by the jailing in April of organisers of pro-democracy protests in 2014 and by the reduced presence of pro-democracy legislators after six were removed from parliament in 2016 and 2017 for protesting against Beijing during their oath-taking.Since the end of British rule in 1997, Hong Kong has operated under the “one country, two systems” principal, with a legal system seen internationally as its strongest asset. However, many feel the city’s autonomy has been eroded by Beijing’s growing influence.Martin Lee QC, a pro-democracy figure and former legislator who helped organise the protests, told the Guardian: “If we lose this one, Hong Kong is not Hong Kong any more, it’s just another Chinese city.”On Sunday evening Lee addressed thousands of people outside the government HQ. Thousands were yet to arrive, prompting speculation that the rally could turn into an Occupy-style event in the manner of protests in 2015 that went on for 89 days.Lee said the government was “saying no to democracy and suppressing human rights and the rule of law”, and that if it did not listen he expected further, perhaps bigger protests on 1 July.James To, a veteran Democratic party politician, told the crowd: “[Lam] has to withdraw the bill and resign. The whole of Hong Kong is against her.”Before the late night disturbance police said six people had been arrested for criminal destruction and one for assault. The Hong Kong government says the bill is needed to fight crime and that China is an important strategic partner in that regard. However, suspicions that the initiative for the law had come from Beijing were bolstered last month when a politburo member revealed that its targets included foreigners who had committed crimes against Chinese national security outside China.Corrupt Chinese officials and tycoons who have fled to Hong Kong are also a key concern for the mainland government, which has never had a fugitive transfer request to Hong Kong granted in the 22 years since the end of British rule.Human rights groups, legal alliances and numerous governments have expressed their concern about the bill.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that it could damage the rule of law in Hong Kong, and a bipartisan congressional committee urged Lam’s administration to listen to the concerns, saying local and foreign residents in Hong Kong had to be protected “from a criminal justice system in mainland China that is regularly employed as a tool of repression”. • The Guardian travelled to Hong Kong with the assistance of the Judith Neilson Institute.

"Journalists covering the protests in Hong Kong are experiencing increasing violence at the hands of the police, according to media groups and first-hand accounts from reporters.A range of abuses have been reported, including being shoved and indiscriminately hit with pepper spray or teargas by officers, prompting the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents’ Club to renew calls for an independent investigation.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said her government will formally withdraw the bill that ignited months of protests. Hong Kong residents had feared it could be used by China to extradite people for political reasons. They want guarantees that it cannot be reintroduced at a later date.Protesters want the government to officially recognise that their movement has been a series of legitimate protests, rather than a riot, as has been stated in official communications.Hundreds of people have been arrested in recent weeks, and the protesters are demanding that all of them be freed, and that no convictions should stand against any of them.Police use of force has escalated since the demonstrations began, while protesters have also resorted to increasingly violent measures. Demonstrators say an inquiry into police brutality is the number-one priority.Hong Kong's chief executive is currently selected by a 1,200-member committee, and nearly half of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by limited electorates representing different sectors of the economy. The protesters want to be able to vote for their leaders in free and open democratic elections. Over the weekend, the club said it had seen an increasing number of incidents involving police violence against journalists covering protests in Hong Kong, with assaults on journalists becoming more serious and impeding their ability to work. Frontline journalists regularly wear reflective vests and press credentials when covering demonstrations.The International Federation of Journalists reported more than 30 violent incidents against journalists from 9 June to the end of August, from police, bystanders and even protesters on some occasions.Police pepper-sprayed a group of reporters after they made a number of arrests on Saturday night, including the journalist Holmes Chan, who was livestreaming the incident for Hong Kong Free Press. Chan said police first pushed the group back and then used pepper spray against them without warning.“At least one of those bursts hit me squarely in the face, arms and chest,” Chan said. “I wore a reflective press vest, and did not have protective gear on my face except for my helmet, which also read ‘press’.”Despite being immediately treated by volunteer medics, Chan said he had trouble keeping his eyes open and struggled to stay upright. He ended up in the emergency room with a “chemical eye injury”.In a separate incident on Sunday, police lobbed a teargas grenade at a group of mostly reporters from inside a subway station without warning, scorching the press vest of an Australian photojournalist, Jared Stone, after it exploded.Hong Kong’s government agreed last week to withdraw an extradition bill that prompted a summer of protests, but demonstrators want other demands to be met, including direct elections of city leaders and an independent inquiry into police actions.As the protests haves escalated, police have increasingly used water cannon, teargas, rubber bullets, beanbag rounds and severe beatings to quell protests, and also chased protesters into residential areas, metro stations and even ferry piers. Protesters have thrown molotov cocktails at police, and vandalised and set public facilities on fire.Police have been accused of making it more difficult for reporters to do their work, allegedly shining bright lights or torches directly at photographers and video crews, according to the Hong Kong photojournalist May James.James, who says she was pepper-sprayed by police over the weekend while taking photos, has covered the protests since they began and said interactions with the police have gradually deteriorated over the past three months, particularly when journalists try to document arrests of anti-government protesters.“I felt sorry for them [at the beginning of the protest] but now it seems like they have too much power,” she said. “There’s a lot of anger towards the

"A sea of protesters, most dressed in black and carrying white flowers of mourning, have swept through central Hong Kong to denounce a controversial extradition law and demand that the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, steps down.Organisers claimed that nearly 2 million people turned out on Sunday, which would make the demonstration the largest in Hong Kong’s history. They poured in from all over the city, in numbers so large that the march route had to be extended, and then widened, halting all traffic outside government headquarters. Echoes of protest songs, hymns and chants bounced off the surrounding high rises as darkness fell and then into the evening, hours after the early afternoon start of the protest, which remained peaceful throughout.It was an extraordinary show of grassroots political power in a city where residents cannot choose their leaders but are free to take to the streets to denounce them. Veteran activists with years of protest experience walked beside novices who had little interest in politics until this crisis flared up.“Before this week I had never been on a protest,” said 28-year-old Lau. “But I am a teacher, and I realised if I didn’t come I wouldn’t be able to face my students. This is their future.” Like many others, she had been unnerved by the arrests of activists and did not want her full name printed.Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, had agreed to suspend the extradition bill after a week of protests, perhaps the most serious government climbdown in the face of public pressure since a security law was dropped in 2003. But if she hoped to defuse public anger before Sunday’s march, she badly misjudged the city’s mood.“Suspending the law but not cancelling it is like holding a knife over someone’s head and saying, ‘I’m not going to kill you now.’ But you could do it any time,” said Betty, an 18-year-old protester who just finished school. “We’re fighting for our freedom.”Demonstrators turned out in force, calling on authorities to withdraw the bill, free activists rounded up after previous demonstrations, and hold police accountable for violent crowd control tactics. Many also demanded Lam’s resignation.Hong Kong’s largest demonstration was a 1989 protest against Beijing’s bloody crackdown on students that year.“If indeed today’s turnout was at a record high, as organisers claim, Lam would appear to have succeeded in making Hong Kongers just as anxious and angry as they were about Tiananmen Square,” said Antony Dapiran, author of a history of protest in Hong Kong.Organisers hoping to keep up pressure on Lam have called for students and workers to strike on Monday, and for shops to stay shut. They may expect a further boost from prominent activist Joshua Wong, who became the face of the umbrella movement in 2014 and is due to be released from jail the same day.After hours of protests, Lam issued a fresh apology on Sunday through a spokesman “acknowledging that deficiencies in the government’s work” have caused controversy and disputes.But although she promised a humble acceptance of criticism, Lam’s statement was couched in the vaguest terms, and met with derision on the streets.“Our demands are clear. She hasn’t addressed any of them,” said a protester, William Cheung, 31. “And why can’t she apologise in front of a camera, rather than in a dry official statement?”Hong Kong’s most dramatic political crisis in years was set in motion a week earlier, when about a million people turned out – dressed mostly in white – to protest against the planned extradition law.The legislation would allow residents and visitors to be sent for trial in China’s opaque Communist-controlled courts, which critics say would fatally undermine Hong Kong’s economy and society.Lam had shrugged off the first demonstration, even though it was one of the largest the city has ever seen, and vowed to force the bill through Hong Kong’s legislature.On Wednesday, demonstrations spiralled into the worst political violence since the handover from British rule, with police firing teargas and rubber bullets and attacking protesters. Later, there were arrests of activists, including in hospital.With Sunday’s march already scheduled, and public anger heightened by police brutality and the detentions, Lam was eventually pushed into her dramatic reversal, reportedly after meeting top Chinese officials across the border.But if anything the press conference in which she announced the bill would be suspended seemed to encourage rather than deter her opponents.Protesters said they were infuriated by Lam’s air of confident determination as she insisted the law was fundamentally sound, defended police violence and insisted her only mistakes were in communication.“There are so many young people here today, and if there is one person who mobilises them, it is Carrie [Lam],” said opposition lawmaker Emily Lau, who welcomed the huge turnout as vital to defending Hong Kong’s freedoms. “The only way to ensure we keep our civil liberties is to be internally vigilant”.There was a sea of protest signs, ranging from a vast banner, carried by dozens, that read “Oppose the evil police, protect the students”, to small witty handmade signs poking fun at Lam’s hardline language.“They are kids, not rioters” read one. “HK has become China, we’re all stuffed” said another. Others held up sombre images of police violence earlier in the week.Many protesters also carried white flowers in tribute to a man who fell to his death on Saturday night while hanging up a large protest banner on a building in the town centre. Several people described the 35-year-old, who has not been identified, as their movement’s “first martyr”.Along the march route there were official condolence books to sign, and thousands left bunches of roses and lilies, gerbera and babies blossom at the site of his death to create an impromptu shrine.Older marchers said that although they feared Hong Kong faced the most serious crisis of their lifetime, they had found hope in the numbers of young protesters.“I’m very encouraged by the younger people. If it was just us [the older generation] the city would be finished,” said 75-year-old Mr Wu, marching despite his age and the enervating heat. “I was a refugee. I escaped China when there was a famine, and I saw people being shot there. The Communist party isn’t to be trusted.” ","'They're kids, not rioters': new generation of protesters bring Hong Kong to standstill",2019-06-16/18:33:22,a sea of protesters most dressed in black and

"Hundreds of protesters have broken into Hong Kong’s legislature, spraying graffiti on the walls and raising the former colonial flag, which includes the British union jack.For hours the protesters had been repeatedly striking reinforced glass walls with a metal trolley and poles as hundreds of others watched on. Once inside they threw chairsand tore down and defaced portraits of past lawmakers.Police who earlier in the day had been standing guard armed with pepper spray and guns marked “less lethal” were nowhere to be seen.The direct action unfolded after a peaceful march of half a million people made its way through other parts of the city on the anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to China. For the past month protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland.Before the protesters broke in to the legislative building, at one point about half a dozen pro-democracy and independent lawmakers came between the demonstrators and police and called for calm.They pushed against the trolley, acting as human shields between it and the building. They were roughly handled by dozens of young protesters, some of whom punched and pulled their arms. They were shouted down and the protesters continued pounding the glass.“They simply wouldn’t listen to me,” said Lam Cheuk-ting, one of the lawmakers. “The movement at large is peaceful, but some young people are overwhelmed by a strong sense of helplessness and they’re emotionally charged.”The police had called on the march organisers to consider rescheduling or shortening it, but it left just before 3pm when tens of thousands began snaking their way through the city.The organisers, the umbrella group the Civil Human Rights Front, did change the end point of the march. Marchers who carried on beyond the approved march route could potentially be charged with illegal assembly under Hong Kong law.Police issued a statement earlier saying they “absolutely” respected people’s right to “assembly, procession and expression of opinion in a peaceful and orderly manner”, but that there was “a serious safety threat” in the Admiralty and Wan Chai areas of the city. They advised the public to carefully consider whether they should join the public procession.China reiterated its stance against what it called “foreign interference” in Hong Kong. Speaking in Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the UK’s rights and obligations under the joint declaration on the 1997 handover of Hong Kong had ended.“Britain has no so-called responsibility for Hong Kong. Hong Kong matters are purely an internal affair for China. No foreign country has a right to interfere,” Geng told a daily news briefing.“Recently Britain has continuously gesticulated about Hong Kong, flagrantly interfering. We are extremely dissatisfied with this and resolutely opposed.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongEarlier in the day, the chief executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, attempted to calm the mood, as an official ceremony took place at a convention centre in Wan Chai to mark the 22nd anniversary of the handover.In her speech, Lam referred to the protests, saying they had made her realise “the need to grasp public sentiments accurately”. She said: “I am also fully aware that while we have good intentions, we still need to be open and accommodating.”The rallies are the latest manifestation of growing fears that China is stamping down on the city’s freedoms and culture with the help of the finance hub’s pro-Beijing leaders.Although returned to Chinese rule in 1997, Hong Kong is still administered separately under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems”. The city enjoys rights and liberties unseen on the autocratic mainland, but many residents fear Beijing is already reneging on that deal.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. While the recent protests were initially sparked by Lam’s attempts to pass the proposed extradition legislation, the demonstrations have morphed into a wider movement against her administration and Beijing.",Hong Kong protests: demonstrators storm

"Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, has said she will “immediately” set up a platform for dialogue with citizens and tackle complaints against the police, after a weekend of peaceful protests that she hoped would be the start of a return to calm in the financial hub. Her offer was dismissed by activists as “a trap”, however.“Work will start immediately to build a platform of dialogue,” Lam said. “We hope this dialogue can be built upon a basis of mutual understanding and respect to find a way out for Hong Kong.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongShe said the platform would be “open and direct” and the government would reach out to people from all walks of life from different political backgrounds.“I sincerely hope this is the start of society returning to calm and turning away from violence,” she said.An estimated 1.7 million protesters staged a peaceful rally in torrential rain on Sunday, the 11th week into a wave of mass protests that have often ended in violent clashes between police and protesters. Hong Kong authorities have used teargas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds to disperse crowds in previous protests but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. Hundreds have been arrested since June.Tensions reached a new level last week with the closure of the territory’s airport, following violent clashes with police.Chinese state media outlets posted videos showing armoured Chinese troop carriers purportedly driving into Shenzhen, the south-eastern city that borders Hong Kong.Lam also said an existing watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), would hire overseas experts to help carry out a “fact-finding study” to investigate the incidents in recent months, including an attack by armed thugs at the Yuen Long metro station in July, which left dozens injured.She said she expected a report, to be completed within six months, would help prevent violent clashes from recurring.Protesters have demanded a third-party investigation into police actions. It seems unlikely Lam’s promises will satisfy them, as critics say the IPCC comprises mostly pro-government figures who are unlikely to be critical of police.The wave of protests, which started in early June to oppose a controversial extradition bill under which individuals could be sent to China for trial, morphed into a broader movement in which demonstrators demanded five things: the complete withdrawal of the now-suspended extradition bill; the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence; a halt to the characterisation of protests as “riots”; an amnesty for those arrested; and a resumption of political reform to allow the free election of Hong Kong’s leader and legislature and Lam’s resignation.On Tuesday, Lam repeated her earlier pledge that the extradition bill was “dead”.“There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns,” she said.Protesters have demanded its complete withdrawal as there is no institutional guarantee that it cannot be revived. Jimmy Sham, convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organised Sunday’s peaceful protest, said Lam’s offer was “a trap” to deceive Hong Kong people, because she had already refused the protesters’ five requests.“Her promises have fallen through every time. If she says the bill is dead then why can’t she just officially withdraw it? You don’t need further communications to do that,” Sham said. “If her offer of communications is just a means to reach her goal then it’s just a trap … Hong Kong people are not as stupid as she thinks.”Further protests are planned for the next few days. Demonstrators say they will escalate their actions again if the government does not properly address their concerns.Meanwhile, three people aged between 24 and 35 were wounded, one of them in a critical condition, after being attacked by a knife-wielding man in the early hours of Tuesday while guarding a “Lennon wall”, where people have put up colourful sticky notes with pro-democracy messages.

"At least 12 people have been arrested in the first wave of detentions linked to anti-government protests in Hong Kong that led to the storming and vandalising of the city’s parliament.At least 11 men and one woman were arrested on suspicion of trying to disrupt celebrations marking the 22nd anniversary of the former British colony’s return to Chinese rule on Monday.On Thursday police said they have been been charged with offences that range from “possession of offensive weapons, unlawful assembly, assaulting a police officer, obstructing a police officer, offence against air navigation ( HK) order 1995 and failing to carry identity document”. The oldest was 31 and the youngest was just 14.For the past month, protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland as anger has grown against Hong Kong authorities and morphed into a wider political crisis.The occupation of the legislature on Monday night coincided with a massive peaceful protest in which organisers say more than half a million people marched through the city on the anniversary of Hong Kong’s 1997 return to Chinese rule.Officers on Wednesday had gathered debris from the legislature as evidence, showing pictures of bricks, metal bars and shields stacked neatly outside the damaged legislature on their Facebook page on Wednesday.“Police will certainly follow up and bring the culprits to justice for any unlawful acts,” the force said in a statement.Police also arrested a 31-year-old man for assaulting police, criminal damage, forcible entry and disorderly conduct in a public place for his role on 1 July and and an earlier protest in June when thousands of demonstrators had gathered around police headquarters to voice concerns over police violence.On 12 June, police fired 150 rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets at a mostly peaceful crowd.Another eight people were arrested earlier on Wednesday for releasing personal information of police officer’s online, including phone numbers and addresses. Officers were harassed with late night phone calls and threatening text messages.Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has asked to meet with the city’s university students, her office said on Thursday. The student union at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, one of the eight major higher education institutions, turned down the request, saying that the city’s leader had requested a closed-door meeting and that any dialogue must be open to all.Meanwhile, police also arrested people at a rally in support of police on 30 June.Five men and one woman were arrested for possessing offensive weapons, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault and fighting in a public place.On Thursday, Chinese state media blamed meddling by Western governments for unrest in Hong Kong amid an escalating diplomatic spat between China and the United Kingdom the protests.“Ideologues in Western governments never cease in their efforts to engineer unrest against governments that are not to their liking, even though their actions have caused misery and chaos in country after country in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia,” the official China Daily said in an editorial.“Now they are trying the same trick in China.”Reuters contributed to this report",Hong Kong protests: police make first arrests after storming of parliament,2019-07-04/22:45:43,at least  people have been arrested in the first wave of detentions linked to anti government protests in hong kong that led to the storming and vandalising of the city s parliament at least  men and one woman were arrested on suspicion of trying to disrupt celebrations marking the nd anniversary of the former british colony s return to chinese rule on monday on thursday police said they have been been charged with offences that range from possession of offensive weapons unlawful assembly assaulting a police officer obstructing a police officer offence against air navigation hk order  and failing to carry identity document the oldest was  and the youngest was just  for the past month protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the chinese mainland as anger has grown against hong kong authorities and morphed into a wider political crisis the occupation of the legislature on monday night coincided with a massive peaceful protest in which organisers say more than half a million people marched through the city on the anniversary of hong kong s  return to chinese rule officers on wednesday had gathered debris from the legislature as evidence showing pictures of bricks metal bars and shields stacked neatly outside the damaged legislature on their facebook page on wednesday police will certainly follow up and bring the culprits to justice for any unlawful acts the force said in a statement police also arrested a  year old man for assaulting police criminal damage forcible entry and disorderly conduct in a public place for his role on  july and and an earlier protest in june when thousands of demonstrators had gathered around police headquarters to voice concerns over police violence on  june police fired  rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets at a mostly peaceful crowd another eight people were arrested earlier on wednesday for releasing personal information of police officer s online including phone numbers and addresses officers were harassed with late night phone calls and threatening text messages hong kong s chief executive carrie lam has asked to meet with the city s university students her office said on thursday the student union at the hong kong university of science and technology one of the eight major higher education institutions turned down the request saying that the city s leader had requested a closed door meeting and that any dialogue must be open to all meanwhile police also arrested people at a rally in support of police on  june five men and one woman were arrested for possessing offensive weapons assault occasioning actual bodily harm common assault and fighting in a public place on thursday chinese state media blamed meddling by western governments for unrest in hong kong amid an escalating diplomatic spat between china and the united kingdom the protests ideologues in western governments never cease in their efforts to engineer unrest against governments that are not to their liking even though their actions have caused misery and chaos in country after country in latin america africa the middle east and asia the official china daily said in an editorial now they are trying the same trick in china  contributed to this report,Hong Kong Protests,0.273993134
"Several prominent pro-democracy figures have been arrested in Hong Kong in an apparent crackdown on protests that have plunged the city into its worst political crisis in decades.The democracy activists Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, former student leaders of pro-democracy protests in 2014, were arrested on Friday and Andy Chan, the head of a now banned pro-independence party, was detained by police on Thursday. Wong and Chow were charged with offences including taking part in an unlawful assembly on 21 June 21 at Hong Kong police headquarters and released.“All we ask for is just to urge Beijing and the Hong Kong government withdraw the [extradition] bill, stop police brutality and respond to our calls for free elections,” Wong said following his release.“Even though I’ve been jailed three times and I face trial on 8 November – which is three months [away] – we will not stop our fight. We shall never surrender. I urge the international community to send a clear message to President Xi: sending troops or using an emergency ordinance is not the way out. We will continue our fight no matter how they arrest or prosecute us.”A rally planned for Saturday has now been called off out of concern that police will arrest participants en masse. On an online forum, some have called for demonstrators to come out anyway. Many expect the arrests will only generate more public anger and clashes with police.“This won’t scare us. Adding to public anger only pushes more people to rebel,” one user commented on a protest forum.Another wrote: “Even if they bring the tanks out, I will still be there.”On Friday morning, Wong was bundled into a van on the street while he was walking to a metro station, according to Wong and Chow’s political organisation, Demosistō. Chow was arrested at home, while Chan, in a separate incident, was detained at Hong Kong airport.The pair were arrested on suspicion of participating and inciting others to participate in an unauthorised assembly during protests outside police headquarters on 21 June. Wong has also been accused of organising an unlawful assembly.Others reportedly arrested include the former student leader Althea Suen, Shatin district councillor Rick Hui Yiu-yu and New Territories West legislator Cheng Chung-tai. Demosisto’s chairman Ivan Lam was charged in absentia and reportedly could not be arrested because he is in Taiwan.As mass protests continue in Hong Kong, now entering what would be its 13th straight weekend of demonstrations, authorities have worked to put down the protests. In recent weeks, police have banned rallies that were previously permitted and have increased arrests.Police had banned Saturday’s demonstration, organised by the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), which has held several peaceful major marches. Earlier this month the group went ahead with a banned march but on Friday, after news of the three activists’ arrests, it called off Saturday’s event.“Our first principle is always to protect all the participants and make sure that no one bears legal consequences because of participating in the protest that we organised,” said the CHRF vice-convener Bonnie Leung.More than 800 people have been arrested since protests began in early June against a legislative bill that would have allowed suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has said the bill is “dead” but protesters continue to demand it be permanently withdrawn.According to a report by Reuters, Beijing has ordered Lam not to accede to any of the protesters’ demands, which also include launching an independent investigation into police behaviour and implementing direct elections.“This is something the government can do – massive arrests to dry up and sap the strength of the protest movement,” said Joseph Cheng, a retired political scientist who has been following the protests closely.“It’s a campaign, probably a well-planned campaign, to arrest all the activists and this will involve a lot of less famous people who have been standing in the frontlines of the protests,” he said.Saturday’s rally was meant to mark five years since Beijing’s proposal for direct elections in Hong Kong, which would only allow candidates screened by Beijing. The proposal sparked mass protests known as the umbrella movement, of which Wong and Chow were major leaders.Neither has played a central role in the current protests, a largely leaderless movement organised via social media.Wong has attended the protests and spoken out frequently in support of the demonstrators’ demands. Chow has also attended recent demonstrations and maintains an active social media account in support of the protests, but has otherwise kept a relatively low profile.All three activists belong to political organisations that advocate for independence or “self-determination”. Chow was disqualified from running for legislative elections last year on the basis of Demosistō’s support of self-determination, which authorities have interpreted as support for independence.Chan’s Hong Kong National party was banned last year on grounds of national security, the first political group to be outlawed in decades.The protests, which have evolved into a broader political movement demanding universal suffrage in addition to the withdrawal of the bill, pose the most serious challenge to Beijing’s authority over the city since the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.On Thursday the convener of the CHRF, Jimmy Sham, was attacked inside a restaurant by two masked men wielding baseball bats and knives. Another protester, Max Chung, who organised a march in Yuen Long last month, was attacked by four men wielding rods.Observers say the crackdown has affected not only protesters but regular citizens and staff at the Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific, who have been encouraged to inform on their colleagues. Before a class boycott by protesting students next week, teachers have also come under fire from pro-government figures.“This is exactly what white terror means to ordinary people,” said Cheng. “The administration is using all kinds of suppression to create a deterrent effect.”Under the terms of the handover, Hong Kong was promised 50 years of a “high degree” of autonomy, in a framework known as “one country, two systems” in which the city would keep an independent judiciary, legislature, a free press and other freedoms. Protesters say the extradition bill represents the end of Hong Kong’s freedom under Beijing’s tightening control over the city.",Hong Kong protests: Joshua Wong and other pro-democracy figures

"SHANGHAI   - As China’s yuan slips to historically weak levels against the dollar, the central bank’s atypical light touch is spurring speculation that policymakers want to be more judicious in their intervention and have no specific target for the currency. The yuan has lost more than 2.5% against the dollar since the festering China-U.S. trade dispute took a turn for the worse with tariff increases early this month. It is now less than 0.1 yuan away from the 7-per-dollar level authorities have in the past indicated as a floor. A weakening yuan risks sparking outflows, a major concern for policymakers keen to retain investor confidence in a slowing economy and acrimonious trade war with the United States. But the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has done little to keep the yuan in check, beyond issuing yuan-denominated bills in Hong Kong and setting the managed currency’s daily mid-point consistently stronger than market expectations. “My sense is that 7 is no longer so critical as in 2016. Policymakers are more confident,” said Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC Bank in Singapore. “It also depends on the cost of defending 7.”     In 2015, a one-off 2% yuan devaluation fueled depreciation expectations, and Beijing burned through about $1 trillion of foreign exchange reserves to fight back. In 2018, to hold the currency steady, the PBOC raised the cost of shorting the yuan by hiking reserve requirements on forwards. State-owned banks also used swaps and sold dollars to prop up the local unit. Despite the trade war, it was not until this week that senior central bank officials launched a verbal campaign to remind the market that China can keep the yuan “basically stable” and draw on a toolbox of policies to manage fluctuations. “Nothing has gone wrong, and (we) will not allow anything to go wrong,” Liu Guoqiang, PBOC vice governor, told the Financial News, a newspaper run by the central bank. The PBOC did not respond immediately to faxed questions from Reuters about its policy and tactics relating to yuan levels. (GRAPHIC: China's falling yuan approaches 7/dollar - tmsnrt.rs/2W6Aoqb) To yuan watchers, the central bank’s perfunctory actions and messaging suggest a higher degree of comfort with a weaker yuan, while the currency’s stability against a basket of trade-weighted currencies is evidence it is not encouraging excess depreciation. “The authorities are providing only the support needed to cap yuan weakness, rather than trying to strengthen the currency significantly,” Lemon Zhang, a strategist at Standard Chartered Bank wrote in a note. A weaker yuan would theoretically help exporters, many of whom are feeling the pinch of U.S. tariffs on billions of dollars worth of made-in-China goods. BofAML analysts Claudio Piron and Ronald Man reckon China will limit the yuan’s weakness in the run-up to a G20 summit at the end of June, when U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping might meet. If that meeting fails to produce a breakthrough easing trade tensions, “it is clear that China has the capacity and need for yuan depreciation to dollar/yuan 7.13. Fiscal stimulus and monetary easing would be required to support China’s economy,” they said. But analysts suspect the PBOC’s strategy is not just about targeting yuan levels but also involves managing its currency reserves and a growing international role for the yuan. Those explain the central bank’s reluctance to reduce its dollar reserves too quickly or drive up interest rates in the offshore yuan market in order to make it expensive to short-sell the currency. “If the central bank chooses to intervene directly in the market, a decline in the reserves to $2.9 trillion from $3 trillion would trigger greater shock to market confidence,” said Raymond Yeung, ANZ’S chief Greater China economist in Hong Kong. Yeung says the PBOC “is unwilling to see a huge gap between onshore and offshore yuan as that would affect international institutions’ judgment of whether the yuan is capable as a reserve currency”. The offshore yuan this week has been relatively weaker than the onshore one, but the PBOC’s sale of its debt in Hong Kong, intended to drain offshore yuan supplies, has been small scale.  As the central bank juggles multiple objectives, its injections of cash onshore, aimed at spurring lending in a slowing economy, have also been modest, in part to guard the exchange rate.

"We are very unlikely to find out who arranged for thugs to rampage through a Hong Kong train station, armed with wooden sticks and metal rods, hospitalising 45 peaceful passengers. Yet if their approach was indiscriminate, their target was clear – protesters returning from an anti-government march – and their purpose equally plain: intimidation.A pro-Beijing legislator was seen shaking the hands of the white-clad thugs at Yuen Long and has portrayed the men as local residents “defending their homes”. Carrie Lam, the region’s chief executive, condemned Sunday night’s violence – but spent more time criticising protesters who had surrounded Beijing’s liaison office and defaced its sign. Many in the protest movement disagree with such tactics. But political attacks on property can hardly be compared to a vicious assault that broke bones and left one man in critical condition.There is a long history of thugs handling political business on the Chinese mainland – where local officials often outsource forced demolitions, for example – and in Hong Kong too. Back in 1993, the then chief of China’s Public Security Bureau said explicitly of triads that “as long as these people are patriotic, as long as they are concerned with Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, we should unite with them”. In 2014, triads attacked pro-democracy demonstrators in the later stages of the umbrella movement.So far six men have been arrested for unlawful assembly in connection with the Yuen Long violence, and police sources have said there are gang links. But the real question is not who they are, but why they were able to perpetrate their vicious attack. Harsh policing in 2014 and at the start of these protests, including the use of teargas and rubber bullets, had already battered the hard-won authority of the police with residents. Now people want to know why, in a region with more than twice as many police per capita as England, it took so long for officers to reach the scene of the violence. While police claim they were tied up by the demonstration, witnesses say officers failed to arrest thugs even when they did reach the station. The assailants seemed so confident of impunity that some of those filmed beating people were not even masked.Ms Lam and Hong Kong’s police chief have angrily denied allegations of collusion, with the chief executive calling them insulting. If Hong Kong police are to retain any credibility whatsoever, they must pursue Sunday’s attackers every bit as assiduously as they have pro-democracy activists, while the government must launch fully independent investigations of both the policing of demonstrations and the tardy response to the Yuen Long attacks, as protesters have demanded. Don’t hold your breath.But a refusal by authorities to take this chilling attack seriously will guarantee that mistrust and antagonism continues to spiral. (Some worry that the assaults were intended to goad protesters into violence themselves.) While some will no doubt heed the thugs and stay away from future demonstrations, others appear more determined than ever to take to the streets. There are already calls for a rally at Yuen Long. And the protests, now in their seventh week, will burn on instead of burning out.",The Guardian view on violence in Hong Kong: an attack on the idea of democracy,2019-07-23/18:39:29,we are very unlikely to find out who arranged for thugs to rampage through a hong kong train station armed with wooden sticks and metal rods hospitalising  peaceful passengers yet if their approach was indiscriminate their target was clear protesters returning from an anti government march and their purpose equally plain intimidation a pro beijing legislator was seen shaking the hands of the white clad thugs at yuen long and has portrayed the men as local residents defending their homes carrie lam the region s chief executive condemned sunday night s violence but spent more time criticising protesters who had surrounded beijing s liaison office and defaced its sign many in the protest movement disagree with such tactics but political attacks on property can hardly be compared to a vicious assault that broke bones and left one man in critical condition there is a long history of thugs handling political business on the chinese mainland where local officials often outsource forced demolitions for example and in hong kong too back in  the then chief of china s public security bureau said explicitly of triads that as long as these people are patriotic as long as they are concerned with hong kong s prosperity and stability we should unite with them in  triads attacked pro democracy demonstrators in the later stages of the umbrella movement so far six men have been arrested for unlawful assembly in connection with the yuen long violence and police sources have said there are gang links but the real question is not who they are but why they were able to perpetrate their vicious attack harsh policing in  and at the start of these protests including the use of teargas and rubber bullets had already battered the hard won authority of the police with residents now people want to know why in a region with more than twice as many police per capita as england it took so long for officers to reach the scene of the violence while police claim they were tied up by the demonstration witnesses say officers failed to arrest thugs even when they did reach the station the assailants seemed so confident of impunity that some of those filmed beating people were not even masked ms lam and hong kong s police chief have angrily denied allegations of collusion with the chief executive calling them insulting if hong kong police are to retain any credibility whatsoever they must pursue sunday s attackers every bit as assiduously as they have pro democracy activists while the government must launch fully independent investigations of both the policing of demonstrations and the tardy response to the yuen long attacks as protesters have demanded don t hold your breath but a refusal by authorities to take this chilling attack seriously will guarantee that mistrust and antagonism continues to spiral some worry that the assaults were intended to goad protesters into violence themselves while some will no doubt heed the thugs and stay away from future demonstrations others appear more determined than ever to take to the streets there are already calls for a rally at yuen long and the protests now in their seventh week will burn on instead of burning out ,Hong Kong Protests,0.269514918
"Police armed with batons and pepper spray have clashed with thousands of protesters at Hong Kong’s international airport after they blockaded the departures area, forcing flights to be suspended for a second day.After a day of largely peaceful protests, marked mostly by arguments between demonstrators and frustrated travellers, violence broke out between riot police and demonstrators after nightfall.A group of uniformed police officers entered the airport, where they were met with a sea of laser pointers and chants of “Give back the eye”, in solidarity with a woman badly injured in earlier protests who may lose the sight in her right eye.Those officers left and soon after riot police arrived, using pepper spray and batons to try to enter the airport. Protesters quickly erected barricades and there was a series of violent confrontations and several arrests.At one point, unarmed demonstrators cornered an armed officer who had forced a woman to the ground, grabbed his baton off him and beat him with it until he drew a pistol and they fled, according to footage shared on social media.Within 30 minutes, the police withdrew. They later said they had gone in to rescue an injured man who had been detained by protesters on suspicion of being an undercover officer, the Associated Press reported.Crowds had prevented paramedics from reaching the man for several hours, even as he slipped in and out of consciousness, reporters at the scene said.A second man detained by protesters on suspicion of being a spy was identified by the nationalistic Chinese tabloid Global Times as their reporter. The editor, Hu Xijin, appealed for his release before he was evacuated by medics.After the police retreated, protesters barricaded themselves into the terminal, leaving the two sides in an uneasy standoff. It was the fifth consecutive day that thousands of people had flocked to demonstrate at the city’s airport.It was reported that the airport authority had secured an injunction against those occupying the terminal building. The South China Morning Post said a source had confirmed that the authority, represented by senior counsel Benjamin Yu, was granted the injunction by a judge late on Tuesday night.It was not immediately clear what the scope of the injunction to remove the protesters would be or how it would be enforced, but technically it would become effective once it was posted in a public area at the airport. The pro-democracy protest movement, originally launched in response to a controversial extradition law, is now in its 10th week and there have been increasingly violent clashes between police and protesters.The airport protest came as the United Nations high commissioner for human rights urged Hong Kong’s authorities to exercise restraint and investigate evidence of its forces firing teargas at protesters in ways banned under international law.Airport check-in operations were suspended at 4.30pm as protesters gathered in the arrivals hall, as well as some departure areas, using luggage trolleys to blockade the doors to customs checkpoints.Floors and walls were covered with notes penned by activists and other artwork. The scene was peaceful as protesters spoke to travellers, explaining their motives.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongRights groups and democracy activists have accused police of using increasingly excessive force. At least 40 people were treated in hospital after clashes on Sunday, including a woman who was reportedly hit with a beanbag round fired from a police shotgun and could lose an eye.Medical staff at more than a dozen public hospitals staged a sit-in on Tuesday against police tactics and the government’s refusal to accede to protesters’ demands. The Civil Human Rights Front, a group which has organised several of the mass marches over the past two months, called for a new rally on Sunday.The unprecedented cancellation of all flights on Monday coincided with the latest in an increasingly threatening series of statements by Beijing. A Chinese official said “terrorism” was emerging in the city, while in Hong Kong authorities demonstrated water cannon for use in crowd control.Late on Monday, two Chinese state media outlets ran videos showing armoured personnel carriers purportedly driving to Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong.On Tuesday, the territory’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said violence was pushing Hong Kong “down a path of no return”. .Lam, who at one point appeared to be near tears, appealed for calm but again refused any concessions to protesters. “Take a minute to think, look at our city, our home, do you all really want to see it pushed into an abyss?” she asked.Clad in black and wearing face masks, their unofficial uniform, protesters at the airport on Tuesday chanted: “Stand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom,” as passengers scrambling to catch rescheduled and delayed flights from Monday.One protester, Vanessa Lee, said: “Of course we apologised to people who are affected by our actions but we hope they understand what we are fighting for. We spared some [space] for them to do their check-in process and we are trying to leave them.”The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy.They have plunged the Chinese territory into its most serious crisis since the handover from British colonial rule, and presented President Xi Jinping with one of his biggest challenges since he came to power in 2012.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a promise it would retain a high degree of autonomy, an independent judiciary and freedoms not allowed on the mainland.Demonstrators say they are fighting against the erosion of that “one country, two systems” arrangement.Chris Patten, Hong Kong’s last British governor, warned on Tuesday that Chinese intervention would be disastrous.“That would be a catastrophe for China and of course for Hong Kong,” Patten told the BBC. “Since President Xi has been in office, there’s been a crackdown on dissent and dissidents everywhere.

"Hong Kong has been rocked by protests since early June, many of which have ended in violent clashes between police and demonstrators.The protests were initially focused on a bill that would have made it possible to extradite people from Hong Kong to China, where the Communist party controls the courts. Many Hongkongers feared the law would be used by authorities to target political enemies and that it would signify the end of the “one country, two systems” policy, eroding the civil rights enjoyed by Hong Kong residents since the handover of sovereignty from the UK to China in 1997. Millions of people joined street marches against the bill, paralysing the city. The protests have gone from weekly to almost daily.The heavy-handed response from police, including violent clashes and the use of teargas and rubber bullets against demonstrators and the blinding of a woman in one eye, prompted the movement adopt wider pro-democracy goals.The extradition bill was suspended by the territory’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, in mid June, but protesters want it officially withdrawn. In addition to demanding Lam’s resignation, the protesters are calling for:The complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition billThe government to withdraw the use of the word “riot” in relation to protestsThe unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them droppedAn independent inquiry into police behaviourImplementation of genuine universal suffrageProtests at the airport have escalated, culminating in its temporary closure and disruption to hundreds of flights, including to long-haul departures to the US, Australia and the UK. Lam said on Tuesday that “lawbreaking activities in the name of freedom” were damaging the rule of law and that the territory’s recovery from the protests could take a long time.China’s civil aviation authority issued a warning to Hong Kong’s carrier, Cathay Pacific, about the involvement of its staff in protests. It said that from 11 August, all personnel from the airline “involved in and supporting illegal demonstrations” would no longer be able to fly to mainland China or work there in air transportation.China has accused foreign powers, particularly the US, of fomenting the demonstrations in Hong Kong. State media has gone from near silence on the protests and blanket censorship of footage of the demonstrations, to describing protests as “riots”. Beijing has described protestors are described as ‘“radicals”, “thugs” and “terrorists” seeking to topple the entire system through their push for independence. Meanwhile, Chinese army vehicles have been spotted at the border, stoking fears of a looming violent crackdown.The UK has called for an independent investigation into the protests, condemned violence and emphasised the right to peaceful protest. China criticised the intervention and said it was “simply wrong” for Britain’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to directly call Lam to “exert pressure”.China asked Washington to explain reports in Communist party-controlled media that US diplomats were in contact with student leaders of the protests. A US state department spokesperson responded by calling China a “thuggish regime” for disclosing photographs and personal details of the diplomat. On 13 August, a senior Trump administration official urged “all sides” to avoid violence.Canada’s Justin Trudeau and Australia’s Scott Morrison have voiced their concern at the handling of the unprecedented political crisis in the wake of the airport protest. Morrison rejected the characterisation of protests as “riots” and Trudeau called for a “de-escalation of tensions”.",What do the Hong Kong protesters want?,2019-08-13/06:33:29,hong kong has been rocked by protests since early june many of which have ended in violent clashes between police and demonstrators the protests were initially focused on a bill that would have made it possible to extradite people from hong kong to china where the communist party controls the courts many hongkongers feared the law would be used by authorities to target political enemies and that it would signify the end of the one country two systems policy eroding the civil rights enjoyed by hong kong residents since the handover of sovereignty from the uk to china in  millions of people joined street marches against the bill paralysing the city the protests have gone from weekly to almost daily the heavy handed response from police including violent clashes and the use of teargas and rubber bullets against demonstrators and the blinding of a woman in one eye prompted the movement adopt wider pro democracy goals the extradition bill was suspended by the territory s chief executive carrie lam in mid june but protesters want it officially withdrawn in addition to demanding lam s resignation the protesters are calling for the complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition billthe government to withdraw the use of the word riot in relation to proteststhe unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them droppedan independent inquiry into police behaviourimplementation of genuine universal suffrageprotests at the airport have escalated culminating in its temporary closure and disruption to hundreds of flights including to long haul departures to the us australia and the uk lam said on tuesday that lawbreaking activities in the name of freedom were damaging the rule of law and that the territory s recovery from the protests could take a long time china s civil aviation authority issued a warning to hong kong s carrier cathay pacific about the involvement of its staff in protests it said that from  august all personnel from the airline involved in and supporting illegal demonstrations would no longer be able to fly to mainland china or work there in air transportation china has accused foreign powers particularly the us of fomenting the demonstrations in hong kong state media has gone from near silence on the protests and blanket censorship of footage of the demonstrations to describing protests as riots beijing has described protestors are described as radicals thugs and terrorists seeking to topple the entire system through their push for independence meanwhile chinese army vehicles have been spotted at the border stoking fears of a looming violent crackdown the uk has called for an independent investigation into the protests condemned violence and emphasised the right to peaceful protest china criticised the intervention and said it was simply wrong for britain s foreign secretary dominic raab to directly call lam to exert pressure china asked washington to explain reports in communist party controlled media that us diplomats were in contact with student leaders of the protests a us state department spokesperson responded by calling china a thuggish regime for disclosing photographs and personal details of the diplomat on  august a senior trump administration official urged all sides to avoid violence canada s justin trudeau and australia s scott morrison have voiced their concern at the handling of the unprecedented political crisis in the wake of the airport protest morrison rejected the characterisation of protests as riots and trudeau called for a de escalation of tensions ,Hong Kong Protests,0.264490753
"Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said her government will formally withdraw an extradition bill that has ignited months of protests and plunged the territory into its biggest political crisis in decades.In a five-minute televised address on Wednesday, Lam said her government would formally withdraw the controversial bill to “fully allay public concerns”.The bill, which would have allowed the extradition of suspects to China to be tried under the mainland’s opaque judicial system, prompted the start of mass protests in June that have led to increasingly violent confrontations with police and the arrest of more than 1,000 people.“Our citizens, police and reporters have been injured during violent incidents,” Lam said. “There have been chaotic scenes at the airport and [mass transit railway] stations; roads and tunnels have been suddenly blocked.“For many people, Hong Kong has become an unfamiliar place.”Lam shelved the bill in June, and in July again insisted it was “dead” after weeks of protest from demonstrators who argued it could be revived if it was not formally withdrawn.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongWith Wednesday’s announcement, Lam has now conceded to one of five key demands of the demonstrators. However, the chief executive did not respond to protesters’ other demands, which include an independent inquiry into police behaviour, amnesty for those arrested, and democratic reforms to give Hong Kong residents universal suffrage.Lam said she did not believe the government should establish an inquiry to look into police behaviour, deferring to an existing police watchdog agency, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC). Lam said she would be adding two new members to the council.Instead, Lam proposed “four actions to help society move forward,” including pledges to follow up recommendations from the IPCC and set up a platform for dialogue, inviting community leaders and experts to advise the government on social issues.“After more than two months of social unrest, it is obvious to many that discontentment extends far beyond the bill,” she said. “Let’s replace conflicts with conversations.”Lam’s announcement, which marks a volte-face after months of vowing not to back down to the protesters, comes less than a month before China celebrates its national day on 1 October, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.Response to the withdrawal was muted in mainland China. On the microblog Weibo, news of the withdrawal appeared to be censored and there were few reports of the news in Chinese state media.“She has to do something otherwise it’s going to be ugly,” said Michael Tien, one of the pro-Beijing lawmakers who attended a meeting with Lam before her announcement. “So she is making this gesture now, this concession. There is a month in between where she was hoping things would die down.”In the meeting, Lam came across as calm and hopeful, according to Tien. “I think she honestly felt that this could settle the score.”It remains to be seen whether the measure will calm protests which have morphed into a much broader political movement, much of it fuelled by public anger at the police and the government.After Lam’s speech, hundreds of protesters gathered Mong Kok in Kowloon, the site of several recent clashes, facing dozens of riot police. Across the city, protesters held a “people’s press conference” outside Hong Kong’s legislature.“This is like applying a band-aid to rotting flesh,” said one protester, dressed in all black and wearing a mask and hard hat. “The withdrawal cannot compensate for our blood and tears over the past three months,” another said.The organiser of several large marches over the course of the protest, Civil Human Rights Front, said it would continue with protests until all five demands were met.“The withdrawal of the bill is too little too late,” said Bonnie Leung, vice convener for CHRF. “One demand has been accepted so we maybe can celebrate a bit,” she said.“But we see police brutality everyday, we have victims everyday. We cannot just leave it. Hong Kong people will still fight for justice and fight for the future of Hong Kong.”The protests have pushed Hong Kong, a major financial and business hub, to the brink of a recession, with businesses and shops suffering and investors reconsidering their presence in the city. On Wednesday, Cathay Pacific’s chairman John Slosar resigned, after its CEO Rupert Hogg left last month, amid pressure from Beijing on the Hong Kong airline whose staff have been supportive of the protests.A survey of private business activity released on Wednesday showed the “steepest deterioration in the health of the private sector since February 2009”, at the height of the global financial crisis. Ahead of Lam’s speech, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index jumped 4%.The protests have also pitted Hong Kong’s freedoms, as promised under the terms of the former British colony’s handover to China in 1997, against Beijing’s authority over the city.Earlier this week, Reuters published a recording of Lam speaking to a group of business executives in which she said she would step down if she were able to – suggesting Beijing had strong-armed her into remaining in office.On Tuesday, however, Lam told reporters she wanted to remain in office to see Hong Kong through a difficult period.Lam’s announcement came after a weekend of some of the worst clashes of the past three months as protesters threw petrol bombs and the police deployed water cannons, rubber bullets and teargas. On Sunday, protesters paralysed links to the city’s airport, a major international travel hub.Police were seen beating passengers in metro stations and arresting one bystander who was heckling them. A video on Tuesday, showed police chasing and tackling secondary students. In a separate incident, a young man was taken out of a rail station on a stretcher, apparently unconscious, after police had subdued him.“This announcement cannot change the fact that the Hong Kong authorities have chosen to suppress protests in a grossly unlawful way that has seriously damaged the people’s trust and sense of legitimacy of the government,” said Man-kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.University and secondary school students launched a class boycott this week and protesters have planned further action in the weeks ahead. It includes another attempt to paralyse the airport, and a rally outside the US consulate in Hong Kong, to call on lawmakers to pass legislation that would sanction officials deemed as suppressing freedom or human rights in Hong Kong.On Wednesday, protesters remained suspicious of Lam’s concession. “She’s just doing this to try and disintegrate the movement. A lot of people think that,” said a protester, who gave her name only as Katya.“The situation has escalated to a point where not even Beijing knows how to sort this. So they’re using different tricks and lies.”“Lam is famous for breaking promises,” said Jackie Lee, 36, who said he believed the concession was an attempt to appeal to less extreme demonstrators, and split the protest movement.",Hong Kong's leader withdraws extradition bill that ignited mass protests,2019-09-04/13:49:50,hong kong s leader carrie lam has said her government will formally withdraw

"A human chain stretched for kilometres across both sides of Hong Kong harbour on Friday night, as people turned out for a peaceful demonstration inspired by anti-Soviet protesters three decades ago.Joining hands and singing songs, tens of thousands of demonstrators lined Hong Kong’s pavements, overpasses, waterfronts and parks, and scaled one of its most famous peaks, picking out the outline of Lion Rock with the light of waving mobile phones.On 23 August 1989, around 2 million protesters formed a human chain stretching 370 miles (600km) across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, a show of defiance against Moscow that became known as the Baltic Way. Within a year, the three countries would all be independent. The symbolism is unlikely to be lost on authorities in Beijing.Eleven weeks into the city’s most widespread protest movement since the handover from British colonial rule in 1997, China has already accused demonstrators of terrorism, working with foreign powers and fomenting a “colour revolution” against Chinese rule.Friday night’s protest was unauthorised but peaceful. Violence and police brutality have occurred at several smaller protests that had been denied official permits, but there have been no incidents at larger marches, which drew crowds of up to 2 million.For Friday’s “Hong Kong Way” demonstration, organisers had called for people to gather in single file along routes that roughly matched subway lines, snaking nearly 30 miles (50km) through Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. They began turning out long before the official 8pm start, old and young, office workers in suits standing beside students in the unofficial protest uniform of black clothes and face masks.Protesters cited the Baltic human chain as inspiration. “In that place, at that time, people tried to use this form of expression to express their wish for freedom from the Soviet state,” said a protester named Kay, who declined to give her surname for fear she might be penalised at work for joining the protests.“In very similar terms, the Hong Kong people are trying to express themselves and express their yearning for freedom and basic human rights,” she said.Unlike other protests that have snarled up the city, demonstrators stood in single file along pavements. The chain broke and formed again at road junctions to allow traffic through. After the protest ended at 9pm local time, they melted back into the streets, following one of the unofficial mottos of the movement: “Be like water.”When Hong Kong’s protest movement began in June, it was driven by anger at a new law that would have allowed residents and visitors to be sent to mainland China to stand trial in its opaque and politically controlled judicial system. As the demonstrations expanded, however, some protesters began to call for democracy. Protester Ashley Chan said he was doubtful Beijing would make concessions similar to those made by Moscow in 1989, but saw no other method to put pressure on the city’s leader, Carrie Lam.Many protesters also hoped the demonstration would keep international attention focused on the long fight for the city’s rights. “We want all the countries around the world to see see what is happening in Hong Kong,” said Lai Ming Yip.The human chain was formed after another professional show of support for anti-government demonstrators by thousands of accountants who gathered in a city square in a rare political demonstration. Lawyers, teachers and medical workers have turned out for previous rallies. The head of the cabin crew union for the local airline Cathay Dragon said on Friday that she had been fired in retaliation for supporting the movement. Rebecca Sy told a news conference she had been dismissed without being given a reason, but after she was pulled from a flight at short notice and asked by an airline representative to confirm that a screenshot from Facebook was from her account.“It’s not just about the termination of the job, it’s also the whole issue, it’s terrifying. All my colleagues are all terrified,” Sy said.A British consulate employee also went missing two weeks ago on a business trip to the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen. Chinese authorities later said Simon Cheng Man-kit had been detained for “violating public order regulations”.China often uses public order charges against political targets, and has sometimes used the charge of soliciting prostitution. Ou Shaokun, an anti-corruption activist, alleged in 2015 that the authorities in southern Hunan province had framed him by saying they found him in a hotel room with a prostitute.",Hong Kong

"Hong Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, has condemned renewed violent protests that erupted over the weekend but insisted that she would not give in to activists’ political demands.As the former British colony’s biggest political crisis since the handover to China continued into its 12th week, Lam denied on Tuesday that she had lost control of the situation and vowed to tackle the unrest and restore law and order.“Unfortunately the calm vanished in the past weekend. The protests are becoming more and more violent,” Lam told reporters before a cabinet meeting. “I stress that violence is not the way to resolve problems and shouldn’t be justified and glorified.”The weekend protests, which followed a few days of relative calm, saw police use water cannon for the first time on Sunday along with teargas and beatings as they fought running battles with protesters, who threw bricks and petrol bombs. Six officers drew their pistols and one officer fired a warning shot into the air during a heated confrontation after the protest.Police said they detained 86 people over the weekend, including a 12-year-old child, for offences including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons and assaulting police officers.The confrontations were the fiercest yet between police and demonstrators since early June, when a wave of protests started in opposition to an extradition bill under which individuals could be sent to mainland China for trial. The government suspended the bill in mid-June, but protesters demanded the government completely withdraw the bill, fearing it could be reintroduced again.The protests have since escalated into a broader anti-government, pro-democracy movement as Lam refused to formally retract the bill.Lam said again on Tuesday that she was “not accepting those demands” and insisted that the bill “was stopped 2 months ago”.In response to questions on whether the government will resort to declaring a state of emergency in view of the recent chaos, Lam said the government will use existing means in the legal framework to “put a stop to violence and chaos”.A state of emergency would pave way for the Hong Kong government to seek help from the Chinese army to deal with unrest.She insisted that the government would punish violent offenders whatever their political background, saying that police has also arrested dozens for an indiscriminate attack on civilians in a metro station and four of them had been charged with riot. She rejected calls for an independent body to police tactics.She also rejected suggestions that the government has lost control of Hong Kong and refused to step down, saying she wanted to “hold the fort and restore society to law and order”.“We have to say ‘no’ to violence, end the chaotic situation with law enforcement, but we will not give up on the platform for dialogue,” she said.Lam said last week she would establish platforms for dialogue with people from different political backgrounds, although protesters dismissed her offer and said she needed to respond to their demands.Demonstrators have five demands: the complete withdrawal of the now-suspended extradition bill; the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence; a halt to the characterisation of protests as “riots”; an amnesty for those arrested; and a resumption of political reform to allow the free election of Hong Kong’s leader and legislature.",Hong Kong protests: Carrie Lam rejects claims she has lost control,2019-08-27/05:08:48,hong kong s embattled leader carrie lam has condemned renewed violent protests that erupted over the weekend but insisted that she would not give in to activists political demands as the former british colony s biggest political crisis since the handover to china continued into its th week lam denied on tuesday that she had lost control of the situation and vowed to tackle the unrest and restore law and order unfortunately the calm vanished in the past weekend the protests are becoming more and more violent lam told reporters before a cabinet meeting i stress that violence is not the way to resolve problems and shouldn t be justified and glorified the weekend protests which followed a few days of relative calm saw police use water cannon for the first time on sunday along with teargas and beatings as they fought running battles with protesters who threw bricks and petrol bombs six officers drew their pistols and one officer fired a warning shot into the air during a heated confrontation after the protest police said they detained  people over the weekend including a  year old child for offences including unlawful assembly possession of offensive weapons and assaulting police officers the confrontations were the fiercest yet between police and demonstrators since early june when a wave of protests started in opposition to an extradition bill under which individuals could be sent to mainland china for trial the government suspended the bill in mid june but protesters demanded the government completely withdraw the bill fearing it could be reintroduced again the protests have since escalated into a broader anti government pro democracy movement as lam refused to formally retract the bill lam said again on tuesday that she was not accepting those demands and insisted that the bill was stopped  months ago in response to questions on whether the government will resort to declaring a state of emergency in view of the recent chaos lam said the government will use existing means in the legal framework to put a stop to violence and chaos a state of emergency would pave way for the hong kong government to seek help from the chinese army to deal with unrest she insisted that the government would punish violent offenders whatever their political background saying that police has also arrested dozens for an indiscriminate attack on civilians in a metro station and four of them had been charged with riot she rejected calls for an independent body to police tactics she also rejected suggestions that the government has lost control of hong kong and refused to step down saying she wanted to hold the fort and restore society to law and order we have to say no to violence end the chaotic situation with law enforcement but we will not give up on the platform for dialogue she said lam said last week she would establish platforms for dialogue with people from different political backgrounds although protesters dismissed her offer and said she needed to respond to their demands demonstrators have five demands the complete withdrawal of the now suspended extradition bill the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence a halt to the characterisation of protests as riots an amnesty for those arrested and a resumption of political reform to allow the free election of hong kong s leader and legislature ,Hong Kong Protests,0.262073636
"Hong Kong faced a tense calm on Tuesday as clean-up operations were underway to repair damage done by protesters to the city’s legislative council building on Monday night.Debris including umbrellas, hard hats and water bottles were the few signs left of the confrontations that engulfed parts of the Chinese-ruled city overnight after protesters stormed and ransacked the legislature.On Monday night a small splinter group of demonstrators, angry over a controversial extradition bill supported by Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, stormed the building and raised the territory’s former colonial flag on the 22nd anniversary of its hand back to China. The group defaced pictures of former Hong Kong leaders and sprayed graffiti over the walls.At a 4am press conference, Lam condemned the “extremely violent” storming of the legislature, which she described as “heartbreaking and shocking”.As dawn broke after a night of unprecedented drama, some Hong Kong residents questionedwhy the police had not put an end to the attempts to break through the building’s glass walls earlier in the day, and allowed extensive damage to the interior of the building.“The strangest thing was, police were there all along in the morning, confronting the protestors and standing guard inside Legco. Suddenly they all disappeared late afternoon, leaving an empty Legco wide open for the protestors to enter. Empty fort strategy much?” outspoken democracy activist Denise Ho said on Twitter.She added in a later tweet: “The reason why the protesters have resorted to storming into the Legco, is because of this authoritarian government WHO DOES NOT LISTEN.”Lam said it was “not true to say that the government has not responded,” and doubled down on her stance that suspending the controversial extradition bill that prompted weeks of protest in the city was a “very positive response to the demands that we have heard.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongOn Tuesday, Chinese media called for “zero tolerance” after the protests. “Out of blind arrogance and rage, protestors showed a complete disregard for law and order,” the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily, said in an editorial.The city’s police chief meanwhile defended the force’s decision to withdraw from the building temporarily, saying they had found protesters tampering with electricity boxes and were concerned that in the darkness there would be more potential for a “wrong move on either side.”The government headquarters complex which houses the legislature remained closed on Tuesday.On social media, protesters attempted to undo the damage to their reputation as peaceful “model protesters,” posting images of undamaged books, artefacts, and even money left for fizzy drinks they had taken out of a fridge.One image circulated of a note in Chinese on a fridge, with the translation: “A note from the protesters. We are not burglars. We won’t take without asking.”Fearing retribution, most protesters wore masks and repeatedly asked journalists not to take photographs. A rioting charge in Hong Kong carries up to a 10 year jail sentence.At around midnight, police dispersed the crowds, firing teargas at demonstrators. The dramatic scenes came after a peaceful march of half a million people made its way through other parts of the city as its deepest political crisis in two decades showed no sign of abating.Half a dozen pro-democracy and independent lawmakers had earlier scuffled with protesters as they called for calm and pushed against the trolley that was being used to enter the council building.On Tuesday, pro-democracy lawmaker Fernando Cheung said the actions of the protesters were not appropriate, “but I understand where they’re coming from.”He said behind the action was the view that the Hong Kong government’s top priority is “no long serving the people of Hong Kong,” but instead “to assist the Chinese government to implement their national policy.”Cheung said the protesters had tried to go the legal route over the past few years, attempting to elect more representative lawmakers to the council, but the disqualification of their candidates on “political grounds” and the attempt to pass through a “patriotic, nationalist curriculum” in schools had left many feeling “so frustrated and desperate.”He warned there needed to be an overhaul of the system, “or their rebellion and defiance will not subside. I’m sure that they will come back again, one generation after another, and next time around we’re looking at an even younger generation rebelling against this regime.”For the past month protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland as anger has grown against Hong Kong authorities and the territory’s chief executive, Carrie Lam.The rallies are the latest manifestation of growing fears that China is stamping down on the city’s freedoms and culture with the help of the finance hub’s pro-Beijing leaders.Although returned to Chinese rule in 1997, Hong Kong is still administered separately under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems”. The city enjoys rights and liberties unseen on the autocratic mainland, but many residents believe Beijing is reneging on that deal.While the recent protests were initially sparked by Lam’s attempts

"Nine pro-democracy campaigners have been convicted over their leadership of “umbrella movement” rallies in Hong Kong in 2014, in a controversial verdict that has prompted renewed alarm about the city’s political freedom.Protest leaders including the sociology professor Chan Kin-man, 60, the law professor Benny Tai, 54, and the Baptist minister the Rev Chu Yiu-ming, 75, were among those found guilty on rarely used colonial-era public nuisance charges for their roles in the 2014 protests calling for free elections, the largest civil disobedience movement in the city’s history.All three were charged with one count of conspiracy to cause public nuisance. Tai and Chan were also convicted of inciting others to cause public nuisance. The court did not immediately announce sentences for the charges, which each carry a maximum of seven years in prison.The other defendants, including the pro-democracy politicians Tanya Chan and Shiu Ka-chun, the former student leaders Eason Chung and Tommy Cheung, and the activist Raphael Wong, were convicted of inciting others to cause a public nuisance as well as inciting others to incite. One former lawmaker, Lee Wing-tat, was found guilty of incitement to incite others to create public nuisance.In a summary of the judgment, Justice Johnny Chan said civil disobedience was not a defence to a criminal charge. Prosecutors argued that the protests, which shut down parts of the city for almost three months, calling for the rights of Hong Kong residents to elect their own leader, had caused “unreasonable” disruptions to public order.The court said it was “naive to suggest that a concession to introduce the form of universal suffrage ... could be made by the government overnight with a click of the fingers”. The 268-page judgment said it was “equally naive to suggest a mass protest of tens of thousands of people could be dispersed overnight even if a positive response were to come from the authorities”.On Tuesday, supporters holding yellow umbrellas, a symbol of the demonstrations, crowded outside the courthouse. Tai told supporters: “No matter what happens today, I have the confidence that many people here will strive for Hong Kong’s democracy.”The trio founded the pro-democracy Occupy Central movement in 2013, which joined the student-led umbrella movement a year later to block reforms that would allow Hong Kong to have direct elections but only of candidates pre-screened by Beijing.More than two years after the protests ended unsuccessfully, Hong Kong’s justice department brought charges against the group leaders. The nine defendants, known as the “Umbrella Nine”, were the last group of demonstrators to be charged over the 2014 protests.Human rights groups have described the prosecution as politically motivated, criticising the use of vaguely worded public nuisance laws against protesters.“Hong Kong courts, by labelling peaceful protests in pursuit of rights as public nuisance, are sending a terrible message that will likely embolden the government to prosecute more peaceful activists, further chilling free expression in Hong Kong,” said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch.Man-kei Tam, Amnesty International’s Hong Kong director, said: “Today’s guilty verdicts are a crushing blow for freedom of expression and peaceful protest in Hong Kong. The government has used vague charges in their relentless persecution of the Umbrella Nine.“The government is increasingly using prosecutions as a political tool to target peaceful activists, abusing the law to silence debate about sensitive issues such as Hong Kong democracy and autonomy.”The city enjoys rights that do not exist on the Chinese mainland, which are protected by the 50-year handover agreement between Britain and China, but fears are growing that those liberties are being eroded.The protest movement highlighted widespread frustration, especially among the young, over the direction Hong Kong was going in, but failed to win any reforms or concessions from Beijing. Since then, many activists have been prosecuted, with some jailed, while a string of pro-democracy politicians have been barred.On Saturday, more than 200 supporters gathered for a service before the verdict where the crowd prayed and sang songs. The venue – Kowloon Union church – was where Tai, Chan and Chu first announced their Occupy Central manifesto six years ago.“What we are facing is the most powerful autocracy in human history and we have to take back our democratic rights from its hand,” a tearful Tai told his supporters.",Hong Kong 'umbrella movement': nine convicted over protests,2019-04-09/09:07:07,nine pro democracy campaigners have been convicted over their leadership of umbrella movement rallies in hong kong in  in a controversial verdict that has prompted renewed alarm about the city s political freedom protest leaders including the sociology professor chan kin man  the law professor benny tai  and the baptist minister the rev chu yiu ming  were among those found guilty on rarely used colonial era public nuisance charges for their roles in the  protests calling for free elections the largest civil disobedience movement in the city s history all three were charged with one count of conspiracy to cause public nuisance tai and chan were also convicted of inciting others to cause public nuisance the court did not immediately announce sentences for the charges which each carry a maximum of seven years in prison the other defendants including the pro democracy politicians tanya chan and shiu ka chun the former student leaders eason chung and tommy cheung and the activist raphael wong were convicted of inciting others to cause a public nuisance as well as inciting others to incite one former lawmaker lee wing tat was found guilty of incitement to incite others to create public nuisance in a summary of the judgment justice johnny chan said civil disobedience was not a defence to a criminal charge prosecutors argued that the protests which shut down parts of the city for almost three months calling for the rights of hong kong residents to elect their own leader had caused unreasonable disruptions to public order the court said it was naive to suggest that a concession to introduce the form of universal suffrage could be made by the government overnight with a click of the fingers the  page judgment said it was equally naive to suggest a mass protest of tens of thousands of people could be dispersed overnight even if a positive response were to come from the authorities on tuesday supporters holding yellow umbrellas a symbol of the demonstrations crowded outside the courthouse tai told supporters no matter what happens today i have the confidence that many people here will strive for hong kong s democracy the trio founded the pro democracy occupy central movement in  which joined the student led umbrella movement a year later to block reforms that would allow hong kong to have direct elections but only of candidates pre screened by beijing more than two years after the protests ended unsuccessfully hong kong s justice department brought charges against the group leaders the nine defendants known as the umbrella nine were the last group of demonstrators to be charged over the  protests human rights groups have described the prosecution as politically motivated criticising the use of vaguely worded public nuisance laws against protesters hong kong courts by labelling peaceful protests in pursuit of rights as public nuisance are sending a terrible message that will likely embolden the government to prosecute more peaceful activists further chilling free expression in hong kong said maya wang a senior china researcher at human rights watch man kei tam amnesty international s hong kong director said today s guilty verdicts are a crushing blow for freedom of expression and peaceful protest in hong kong the government has used vague charges in their relentless persecution of the umbrella nine the government is increasingly using prosecutions as a political tool to target peaceful activists abusing the law to silence debate about sensitive issues such as hong kong democracy and autonomy the city enjoys rights that do not exist on the chinese mainland which are protected by the  year handover agreement between britain and china but fears are growing that those liberties are being eroded the protest movement highlighted widespread frustration especially among the young over the direction hong kong was going in but failed to win any reforms or concessions from beijing since then many activists have been prosecuted with some jailed while a string of pro democracy politicians have been barred on saturday more than  supporters gathered for a service before the verdict where the crowd prayed and sang songs the venue kowloon union church was where tai chan and chu first announced their occupy central manifesto six years ago what we are facing is the most powerful autocracy in human history and we have to take back our democratic rights from its hand a tearful tai told his supporters ,Hong Kong Protests,0.261806697
"Last Saturday, as Hong Kong braced for another weekend of youth-led mass pro-democracy protests, a group of middle-aged and elderly volunteers prepared for their own rebellion.Gathered in a metro station, they put on bright yellow vests and fumbled with goggles and gas masks. They listened attentively as an organiser went over tactics for slowing the police down and letting protesters escape: distract the officers by asking for change, to borrow their phone, or even by pretending to faint.“All we need to do is buy them a few minutes so the youngsters can get away,” said Wong, 82, who has been placing himself between the protesters and the police over the last several months. “We tell the police: ‘Please don’t beat them up. Let them go. Maybe you could advance a little slower.’”Wong’s group, known as the Guardians, whose stated mission is “protect the children”, is one of many that have formed in response to pro-democracy protests. The demonstrations have led to more than 1,000 arrests and severely strained relations between Hong Kong authorities and the public.Observers say the informal groups of volunteers – from social workers and pastors to lawyers, doctors and first-aid medics – are a testament to the far-reaching impact of the demonstrations.Ma Ngok, an associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said: “This is part of the spirit of the whole movement that different sectors of people are trying to see how they can contribute to the cause. A lot of people are still unhappy about the situation so they try to figure out what they can do by their own means.”Later on Saturday, Uncle Wong and his group found a standoff between protesters and police near the airport. As soon as they arrived, Wong moved quickly to the front, armed with a pair of swimming goggles and his walking stick held aloft in front of him as a barrier. A few hours later, when the police charged at protesters, he did not flinch. One young demonstrator ran past and patted him on the shoulder.“I have no regrets,” Wong said. “I’m willing to take the blow for them. This whole protest needs everyone’s support. If you don’t come out today there may not be a tomorrow.”Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said she will withdraw an extradition bill that first triggered protests in June. But protesters have vowed to continue demonstrating until all their demands are met, including direct democratic elections and an independent inquiry into police conduct.As the Guardians put themselves between police and protesters last weekend, teams of first-aid workers were sent to various locations of potential clashes throughout the city. Social workers monitored social media, looking for signs of self-harm or severe emotional distress among protesters. Others patrolled the streets, carrying megaphones to call out the names and identification numbers of demonstrators being arrested so that lawyers could find and help them.Hammond Tang, 16, a former Scout, was part of a team of first-aid volunteers in Causeway Bay, a shopping district where the police were rumoured to be preparing to move on protesters. Equipped with walkie-talkies and packs of medical supplies, they were on high alert for “TG” – teargas.During the last three months, Tang’s responsibilities have shifted from pouring saline over those hit by teargas to tending to patients hit by rubber bullets and beanbag rounds. “We didn’t expect this many injuries,” he said.Tang’s responsibilities also include breaking up fights between protesters and critics – altercations that happened almost daily, he said. This month a middle-aged man threw a brick at a protester outside Hong Kong airport and was soon surrounded by protesters kicking and hitting him. Tang, a stocky rugby player, raced over and covered the man with his body.A secondary school student, Tang is not always emotionally prepared for the amount of violence he encounters. “Seeing everyone safe is our energy. To save more people … the thank you from those patients is what keeps me going to the frontline.”Many of these groups are building on Hong Kong’s increasingly active civil society, boosted in 2014 during a wave of pro-democracy protests known as the umbrella movement, a precursor to the current demonstrations.Victoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at Notre Dame University, said: “They were already there to jump into action. As the protests have evolved, preexisting groups and new groups have emerged to fill new needs.”In some ways they are also a reaction to what some see as the creeping politicisation of civil society, as pro-Beijing figures are appointed to head different public sectors. Hui said: “The worry is that Beijing already encroached on the civil service in the aftermath of the umbrella movement.”Unlike formal civil society organisations, these groups are loosely organised and often started by individual calls for action online, mirroring how the protesters have operated. A group of Christians maintain a 24-hour channel on Telegram for protesters to share their feelings. Supporters organise supply collections, leaving money, food vouchers, and clothes in metro stations for protesters to change into from their signature all-black outfits. A group of volunteer doctors and nurses help injured protesters who are afraid to go to hospitals where police have arrested demonstrators.Observers say the growth of these satellite protest groups is evidence of the public sympathy demonstrators still command, even after months of political unrest that has damaged one of the strongest economies in the region.On 1 September, as protesters paralysed traffic links between the airport and the city and demonstrators began a seven-mile (12km) walk back to the city, Daniel, 42, was one of hundreds of volunteer drivers who had arrived to ferry stranded protesters home.Daniel, a government worker who had never volunteered before, was watching a livestream on Facebook when he saw the call for drivers. After discussing it with his wife, he arrived at a nearby bridge where dozens of drivers had converged and a volunteer told him where to go. Daniel stayed out until almost 2am, waiting in case he could be of assistance.He said: “They are Hong Kong’s future. I want to do something to help them. We have to trust each other and stick together.”As the protests have divided society, some groups have sought to act as objective observers. Since mid-August, the Hong Kong Neutral Legal Observers Group, a group of about 50 volunteers from the legal sector, have been attending the protests.In green vests identifying themselves as neutral, they attend the protests in shifts, documenting their observations for reports to be published later. They also hold public workshops educating residents on their legal rights and obligations.“Our purpose is to observe public gatherings and defend the rule of law,” said one of the conveners of the group, a partner in the Hong Kong office of an international law firm, who asked not to be named out of concern of possible retribution. “We hope that the presence of lawyers might serve as a reminder of how important it is to respect the law and the rule of law.” Additional reporting by Edwin Lee and An Rong Xu",'I'll take the blow for them': the volunteers protecting Hong Kong

preexisting groups and new groups have emerged to fill new needs in some ways they are also a reaction to what some see as the creeping politicisation of civil society as pro beijing figures are appointed to head different public sectors hui said the worry is that beijing already encroached on the civil service in the aftermath of the umbrella movement unlike formal civil society organisations these groups are loosely organised and often started by individual calls for action online mirroring how the protesters have operated a group of christians maintain a  hour channel on telegram for protesters to share their feelings supporters organise supply collections leaving money food vouchers and clothes in metro stations for protesters to change into from their signature all black outfits a group of volunteer doctors and nurses help injured protesters who are afraid to go to hospitals where police have arrested demonstrators observers say the growth of these satellite protest groups is evidence of the public sympathy demonstrators still command even after months of political unrest that has damaged one of the strongest economies in the region on  september as

"Hong Kong’s metro system was suspended and many of its banks and shopping malls closed after a government decision to invoke sweeping colonial-era powers sparked violent protests across the city.The chief executive, Carrie Lam, provoked a wave of fear and fury on Friday with a ban on face masks at any public gathering, brought in under the emergency regulations ordinance, which had not been used for more than half a century.She also hinted authorities were considering harsher measures, including a curfew and delays to local elections set for November. The legislation gives her government virtually unlimited powers to do anything it considers necessary for public order.The ban on masks was the government’s latest attempt to stop escalating protests that have swept through the city and transfixed the world.In four months of protests Lam has made only one concession – withdrawing the extradition bill that originally brought people on to the streets – but it was widely seen as too little, too late. The movement has five demands now, including an independent inquiry into police brutality and more democracy for the city.Protesters called a day of rest on Saturday, before a large march against the ban on Sunday, but the city was still on edge. The entire MTR metro network, with typically more than 4m trips a day, was shuttered apart from the airport express.It was partially reopened on Sunday ahead of more demonstrations expected later in the day.Also on Sunday, opposition lawmakers sought an emergency injunction in a bid to overturn the face mask ban.“I would say this is one of the most important constitutional cases in the history of Hong Kong,” lawmaker Dennis Kwok told reporters outside court on Sunday. “This could be the very last constitutional fight on our part. In the name of law they are trying to hurt the people and they try to crush the opposition.“If this emergency law just gets a pass just like that Hong Kong will be deemed into a very black hole.”Many shops and supermarkets closed early on Saturday, and even the 7-Eleven convenience stores that are a staple of city life and usually open around the clock, said they would shut in the afternoon. Queues formed at ATMs in the morning, and food shops that were still open were busier than normal.In the afternoon a small, peaceful crowd marched across Hong Kong island, but there were no major demonstrations.Lam put out a pre-recorded video message, accusing protesters of “half-paralysing” the city, and plunging it into a “very dark night”. Flanked by all her ministers, who stood silent as Lam spoke, she called on the city’s 7.5 million citizens to back her.“The extreme violence clearly illustrated that Hong Kong’s public safety is widely endangered,” Lam said, in her first comments since Friday’s ban.Crowds had taken to the streets soon after she announced the ban, effective overnight. Face masks have become a staple at protests, partly because of heavy teargas use and partly because people fear arrest or retaliation if they are identified.Protesters set fire to two metro stations and vandalised shops and businesses considered pro-China; police responded with teargas, and a 14-year-old student was shot in the thigh with a live round. He was taken to hospital in a serious condition.On Saturday, police sent text messages urging the public to avoid protests over the three-day weekend. But despite the transport difficulties, and the fact that Sunday’s protest had not got a police permit, large numbers were expected to turn out.Secondary school students also launched a petition, calling on police not to punish or report them for wearing a mask.The Chinese ambassador to the UK said Beijing would not hesitate to intervene if it thought it was necessary. Despite the worst outbreak of violence yet over the last week, and the shooting of two teenage students with live ammunition, he claimed the situation had improved and denied Lam had lost control.“If the situation in Hong Kong becomes uncontrollable by Hong Kong government, the central government will not sit on their hands and watch,” Liu Xiaoming told the BBC’s Newsnight. He added: “(At present) the situation is still under control and we have full trust in the Hong Kong government and the chief executive.”",Hong Kong suspends metro system and closes banks after violent protests,2019-10-06/05:50:53,hong kong s metro system was suspended and many of its banks and shopping malls closed after a government decision to invoke sweeping colonial era powers sparked violent protests across the city the chief executive carrie lam provoked a wave of fear and fury on friday with a ban on face masks at any public gathering brought in under the emergency regulations ordinance which had not been used for more than half a century she also hinted authorities were considering harsher measures including a curfew and delays to local elections set for november the legislation gives her government virtually unlimited powers to do anything it considers necessary for public order the ban on masks was the government s latest attempt to stop escalating protests that have swept through the city and transfixed the world in four months of protests lam has made only one concession withdrawing the extradition bill that originally brought people on to the streets but it was widely seen as too little too late the movement has five demands now including an independent inquiry into police brutality and more democracy for the city protesters called a day of rest on saturday before a large march against the ban on sunday but the city was still on edge the entire mtr metro network with typically more than m trips a day was shuttered apart from the airport express it was partially reopened on sunday ahead of more demonstrations expected later in the day also on sunday opposition lawmakers sought an emergency injunction in a bid to overturn the face mask ban i would say this is one of the most important constitutional cases in the history of hong kong lawmaker dennis kwok told reporters outside court on sunday this could be the very last constitutional fight on our part in the name of law they are trying to hurt the people and they try to crush the opposition if this emergency law just gets a pass just like that hong kong will be deemed into a very black hole many shops and supermarkets closed early on saturday and even the  eleven convenience stores that are a staple of city life and usually open around the clock said they would shut in the afternoon queues formed at atms in the morning and food shops that were still open were busier than normal in the afternoon a small peaceful crowd marched across hong kong island but there were no major demonstrations lam put out a pre recorded video message accusing protesters of half paralysing the city and plunging it into a very dark night flanked by all her ministers who stood silent as lam spoke she called on the city s   million citizens to back her the extreme violence clearly illustrated that hong kong s public safety is widely endangered lam said in her first comments since friday s ban crowds had taken to the streets soon after she announced the ban effective overnight face masks have become a staple at protests partly because of heavy teargas use and partly because people fear arrest or retaliation if they are identified protesters set fire to two metro stations and vandalised shops and businesses considered pro china police responded with teargas and a  year old student was shot in the thigh with a live round he was taken to hospital in a serious condition on saturday police sent text messages urging the public to avoid protests over the three day weekend but despite the transport difficulties and the fact that sunday s protest had not got a police permit large numbers were expected to turn out secondary school students also launched a petition calling on police not to punish or report them for wearing a mask the chinese ambassador to the uk said beijing would not hesitate to intervene if it thought it was necessary despite the worst outbreak of violence yet over the last week and the shooting of two teenage students with live ammunition he claimed the situation had improved and denied lam had lost control if the situation in hong kong becomes uncontrollable by hong kong government the central government will not sit on their hands and watch liu xiaoming told the bbc s newsnight he added at present the situation is still under control and we have full trust in the hong kong government and the chief executive ,Hong Kong Protests,0.259737164
"It was the third night in a row that Biyanca Chu’s neighbourhood, Wong Tai Sin, a working-class residential district in Hong Kong, had been taken over by police and protesters. The ground was littered with plastic bottles, broken umbrellas and teargas canisters as the two sides faced off.Chu, 22, slight in an all-black outfit, climbed over a road barrier, took off her baseball cap and slipped a gas mask on. “Are you ready to go to the frontline?” she asked her companions and they disappeared. Within half an hour, the police began firing rounds of teargas and rubber bullets, charging and making arrests, until the group dispersed.Later Chu reappeared, wearing a patterned tank top and jeans, a disguise to look like an ordinary university student out for a stroll. She scanned her phone for news of the next protest and set off.Protests and clashes are the new normal for Hong Kong. Home to 7 million people, it was once considered one of the safest cities in the region, but demonstrations triggered in June by an extradition bill that would send suspects to mainland China have turned into a broader anti-government movement.For residents, the protests have not only changed their way of life but also how they see their government and the people charged with protecting the city – a loss of trust so complete, say experts, that it calls into question whether the Hong Kong government will ever be able to govern effectively again.“The government has lost the trust of a whole generation,” said Ma Ngok, an associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.“There is a possibility the movement may die down because of the amount of force or prosecution, but that doesn’t mean the government is winning over these people, especially the young people. They will be angry at both the government and police for years to come.”Marches and rallies have long been a part of Hong Kong civic life, but the past two months have represented a major departure. The protests have also taken a darker turn in recent weeks as clashes have become more violent. Both protesters and police have grown more exhausted and angry, and neither show signs of backing down.Police have fired teargas in 14 of Hong Kong’s 18 districts, and protesters have set fires, thrown petrol bombs and vandalised police stations and other government buildings. Residents caught in the crossfire or witnessing the clashes have begun to come out to condemn the police.One of the busiest and most densely populated cities in the world, Hong Kong has grown quiet as more and more people stay in. Rumours consistently circulate that suspected gangsters are gathering to attack protesters and bystanders – as was the case in a train station in July and at later protests.Residents describe small ways that their lives have changed. Gary Wong, 36, who owns a cafe in the Western district near where several confrontations between protesters and police have taken place, has noticed that he now says “be safe” to his customers when they leave.Dinners with his parents, who support the government and police but know that Wong supports the protesters, are awkwardly quiet as everyone tries to avoid discussing the latest news. Two friends of his, a couple who had been together for at least three years, split up after too many arguments over the protests.Wong and his girlfriend are trying to take a break from the protests. They meet after work, sometimes crying out of anger after reading the news of the latest clashes, but also stay at home more.“You feel weird going to a movie now. It’s like, what are you doing? Why aren’t you out supporting them? People are out there getting teargassed. You feel guilty,” he said.For the protesters, life has changed in more dramatic ways. Relationships with their families have frayed. Some have quit their jobs to focus on the protests full time. Chu, who recently had to skip a university exam because she was so exhausted, says it is hard for her to relate to friends who are not as committed to the cause.“I felt like I was living in a different world from them,” she said, recalling when the protests began in June and she spent the entire day scrolling through updates while her friends were out shopping.Many now carry gas masks with them whenever they go out at night. Almost every day, notices are sent out through the Telegram messaging app alerting protesters that certain users have been detained and probably compromised, and all conversations with them should be deleted.“You are always on high alert. This is not a game,” said one protester and organiser of media campaigns directed at international audiences, who asked to only give his name as Chris.Few locals pause these days at the sight of groups of protesters, dressed in all black, their faces covered by duct-taped goggles and face masks, sitting in groups at public transport stations. Commuters with iPhones are regularly airdropped fliers on the latest demonstration.Rallies and marches are now taking place regularly during the week as well as weekends in locations throughout the city. Protesters are also thinking of new ways to demonstrate that don’t involve direct conflict with the police or risk arrest.“What can we do in the future? Keep going to police stations and yelling? This isn’t going to do anything except help us express our feelings,” said Chu. She hopes soon the protesters won’t have to hide their faces out of fear of arrest because they have won.She quotes a saying that has been circulating on the online forums where the demonstrators organise: “I hope for the day when we can gather outside the legislative building, take off our masks, face each other and celebrate.”","Protests, clashes and lack of trust: the new normal for Hong

"Ryan Lee, a 27-year-old computer engineer, only started taking part in Hong Kong’s demonstrations in June. Since then, it has been a steep learning curve.He has tackled a police officer to the ground to rescue another protester, tossed teargas canisters back at the police and covered the gas grenades with the metal dishes commonly used in Hong Kong for steaming fish.Within weeks Lee has transformed into a militant “fighter” – one of the black-clad protesters in full protective gear who have faced off week after week with police behind makeshift barricades. Saturday was no exception – violent clashes between protesters and police erupted throughout the city as they marched to mark the fifth anniversary of a decision by Beijing to limit democratic reforms.“The government’s hardline attitude is only catalysing the movement,” Lee said. “They might have arrested nearly 1,000 people, but there are just as many people in the frontline because they are constantly being replaced.”Since early June, Hong Kong has been embroiled in its worst political crisis in decades. The wave of protests, sparked by the controversial extradition bill under which individuals can be sent to mainland China for trial, has entered its 13th week. Over the past three months, the protests have become a broader and increasingly violent anti-government movement as the animosity between demonstrators and police reaches boiling point.Last weekend, Lee was among those who threw teargas canisters back at the police in a violent confrontation that lasted about 40 minutes before the crowds dispersed and water cannon arrived. He said the protesters’ determination to fight against the police as long as they could was “a show of our stance and our beliefs”.“When the police abuse their powers and face no consequences, a revolution is justified,” said Lee. “I accept revolution and bloodshed. Revolution is a war and no war is without violence … If our violence can bring about positive changes, I am willing to be involved.”Lee’s anger had already been fuelled by the government’s refusal to fully withdraw the suspended extradition bill, the police’s use of violence, and the government’s failure to set up an independent body to investigate police wrongdoing.But last week the arrests of a number of prominent pro-democracy figures – along with government hints that it was thinking about a draconian emergency law allowing it to make arrests and suppress communications – further enraged him. Some 900 people have been arrested since protests began.Given the threat of the new law, and the possibility of China mobilising the People’s Liberation Army, wasn’t Lee worried that the protesters’ current tactics might actually lead to their existing rights being eroded? “But there is no other way out: we’ll have to burn together,” he said. “In a war, ordinary people always end up sacrificing.”Rock Chan, a technician and former barman, shares the same outrage. He too has been on the frontline in recent protests, providing protective gear to fellow protesters and finding escape routes for them.“The police did nothing to the white-clad men with sticks but said our umbrellas were weapons,” said the 33-year-old, referring to an incident in July when masked men rushed into a metro station to attack civilians indiscriminately. (The authorities took no immediate action but did subsequently make some arrests.)Although the government had banned Saturday’s protests, has arrested pro-democracy figures and hinted at an emergency law, Chan said this would not dampen his resolve.“The more restrictions they impose on us, the stronger the pushback is,” he said. “I want to tell them that we will not back down and we’re not afraid.”Chan, who took part in the Umbrella movement in 2014, said he and others had learned from its mistakes. The 79-day protest, part of the Occupy movement, ended peacefully, after failing to pressurise the government into granting electoral reforms that would give ordinary people a free vote to elect their leader and legislature. People left the occupied thoroughfare voluntarily on the day the site was cleared. Leaders of the movement have since been jailed.“The Umbrella movement was too peaceful. Having just a bunch of people sitting there didn’t pose any threat to the government,” Chan said. “We lost the battle completely. Now we have learned from our mistakes.”Both young men – who do not know each other and were interviewed separately by the Observer – believe a revolution is needed “to save Hong Kong”. Both risk being arrested and jailed for rioting, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. But they both felt strongly that rights and freedoms, as well as Hong Kong’s way of life, had been eroded under Chinese rule – and that that was worth fighting for.“We need a revolution to start afresh, but unfortunately we’re under China,” Chan said. “My demand is actually very simple: I just want a real Hong Kong under a genuine ‘one country, two systems’ [principle].”Asked how they saw the current crisis ending, both men believed there would be a further escalation of violence in the coming months if the government continued to ignore protesters’ demands.Some suspect that China has set a deadline of 1 October – the 70th anniversary of the establishment of communist government – to end the chaos.“I see a wave of escalation [before then] – I think people will use all means to force the government to respond to our demands,” said Lee.Asked whether he was afraid of being arrested, Chan said he had lost sleep, but the wellbeing of Hong Kong mattered more to him. “It’s OK for me to be arrested,” he said, “but it’s not OK to lose our beloved Hong Kong.”* Names have been changed to protect interviewees’ identities","Hong Kong: ‘Revolution is war, and no war is without

"As midnight approached on Monday, four protesters stood their ground inside the battered interior of Hong Kong’s legislative council (LegCo) building where they had barged in a few hours earlier. Surrounded by graffiti and chaos, they insisted on waiting until the police came to arrest them.“Our action might not be useful but it is symbolic,” one young father told a reporter in video footage. “We know we might get eight or 10 years for doing this, but I grew up here, I love the freedoms and the dignified life and I don’t want to lose them.”Suddenly, dozens of other protesters rushed into the chamber, shouting: “Let’s leave together!”, grabbed the four they had named “the death fighters” and frogmarched them away.“If they don’t go, we don’t go,” a young woman said. “We’re all afraid, but we are more afraid that we won’t see those four again.”Emotions have been running high in Hong Kong over the past month during its biggest political crisis in decades. Millions have thronged the streets to protest against a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist party.The protests forced the government to suspend the bill and its leader, Carrie Lam, apologisedfor the crisis that had engulfed the city, but protesters said they wanted more. They demand that the government fully withdraw the bill, release all those arrested in previous protests and launch an investigation into the police’s use of force on 12 June, when they used teargas, rubber bullets and truncheons on largely peaceful crowds.Tensions erupted on Monday, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s 1997 return to Chinese rule, when hundreds of angry protesters stormed and vandalised the Hong Kong’s legislature. Police fired teargas after midnight to disperse them.After police cleared the site, they immediately began to collect evidence against protesters in the early hours of Tuesday. Local media reported that police had stopped many vehicles to check passengers’ identity.A number of young protesters said the storming of parliament was a symbolic act of defiance against a government and political system they had little say in. Hong Kong’s leader is not elected by ordinary voters but by a committee accountable to Beijing. Only half of the 70-seat legislature is directly elected, while the other 35 seats are occupied by mostly pro-establishment figures from corporate and special interest groups.Young people also said it was a sense of hopelessness that had driven them to desperation, as the government continued to fail to respond to their political demands.“Actually we are really afraid of being arrested, but we want to let the world and the government know that we won’t give in so easily,” said a man in his 20s who entered the parliament building on Monday night. He did not want to identified.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongProtesters who barged into the legislative council building graffitied political slogans on walls, spraypainted Hong Kong’s official emblem inside the chamber and blacked out the faces of pro-Beijing LegCo presidents’ portraits. Among the graffiti on the wall, one said: “People will rise up when the authorities pushed them to the brink.” A black banner displayed at the front of the chamber read: “There are no rioters, only violent regimes.” A British colonial-era flag was also put up by the protesters.Others messages scrawled on the walls demanded the government implement universal suffrage, withdraw the extradition bill, refrain from calling the 12 June protest a riot, drop charges against protesters and investigate alleged police brutality.“The spraypainting was meant to be an insult to the government and the legislative system,” said the young man, insisting that protesters had been making a political statement but had not looted the place. He said he had left money for drinks he took and urged others not to wreck interior decorations.“Why did we need to escalate our actions? Because there is so much anger and dissatisfaction. We’ve given them deadlines for our demands again and again. So many people died already and the government still won’t respond,” he said.Most of the protesters interviewed by the Guardian said they were incensed by the government’s callousness for failing to respond to the recent deaths of three people, including a 21-year-old student, who killed themselves after leaving behind messages in protest to the extradition law.“Everything that has happened is the result of the government ignoring us – they asked for it,” another young man said. “If we don’t come out, Hong Kong will collapse!”Another demonstrator who had entered the building said: “We all know that the rioting charge carries 10 years in jail, but why did we still do it? It’s because we have utterly lost hope in this place.”",Hong Kong’s ‘death fighters’: young protesters with nothing to lose,2019-07-03/15:12:52,as midnight approached on monday four protesters stood

"Hong Kong police have launched a wave of arrests against prominent democracy activists and protesters, marking a new phase in government efforts to stop mass protests that have plunged the city into months of political crisis.On Friday, police detained pro-democracy lawmakers and activists, including Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, student leaders of pro-democracy protests in 2014. The pair were charged with unlawful assembly and released on bail. Police said 28 people were arrested.Critics say the mass arrests on the eve of a big rally planned for Saturday are aimed at dissuading protesters who have come out on to the streets for the last 12 weekends, demanding the withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill among other demands.“This is part and parcel of a new round of oppression against the movement,” said Kenneth Chan, a professor in the department of government at Hong Kong Baptist University. “The arrest of other known leaders is meant to intimidate others,” he said.After almost three months of protests the Hong Kong government, backed by Beijing, appears to be escalating its tactics against the protesters, who have shown few signs of backing down. Beijing has reportedly ordered Hong Kong’s leader, chief executive Carrie Lam, not to concede to any of the protesters’ demands.In recent weeks, Lam has hinted that her government could implement a colonial-era law, the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, that would give her sweeping powers to enforce anything from curfews and censorship to an internet shutdown in order to restore public order.“They have run out of options, given they don’t want to give concessions. So they try any way they can think of including arrest and emergency laws,” said Lo Kin-hei, vice-chair of the Democratic party.The protests, triggered in June by a proposed bill that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China, have evolved into a broader democracy movement challenging Beijing’s authority over the city.China’s warnings towards Hong Kong have grown increasingly ominous and the Chinese military has held several rounds of exercises across the border from Hong Kong. But experts say military intervention is Beijing’s last option, choosing instead to rely on the Hong Kong authorities to stop the protests.“We are in a stage where Beijing is increasingly trying to impose costs. It’s fairly clear Beijing has decided to adopt a hardline tactic, using the Hong Kong police, encouraging tougher tactics against protesters, and prosecuting them,” said Adam Ni, who researches China at Macquarie University in Australia.Observers say both the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities are anxious to end the demonstrations before 1 October, when China celebrates 70 years of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, a politically significant holiday for the ruling Chinese communist party.The movement has been largely leaderless – in part to prevent the authorities from targeting particular individuals. Wong and Chow, now of the pro-democracy political organisation Demosistō, have been active in the protests but neither are considered key figures.Others reportedly arrested include the former student leader Althea Suen, district councillor of Shatin, Rick Hui Yiu-yu, and New Territories West legislator Cheng Chung-tai. Another Demosistō member, chairman Ivan Lam, was charged in absentia.Andy Chan, head of a pro-independence party that was banned last year after the authorities deemed it an “imminent threat” to national security, was detained on Thursday night at Hong Kong airport.“They are symbols of what the protesters are fighting for. It’s a very visible signal to the protesters that there will be a cost for you, that we will keep arresting these people who continue to protest and resist,” said Ni.Vocal democracy advocates are bracing for more arrests in the days to come. Fernando Cheung, a pro-democracy lawmaker who has been active in the demonstrations, posted on Facebook on Friday evening to alert friends that he had not been arrested. “Thank you for your concern, see you tomorrow on Hong Kong island!” he said, suggesting he would be at the protests on Saturday.Activists publicly involved in the protests have in some cases been physically attacked. On Thursday, Jimmy Sham, the convener of the Civil Human Rights Front – the group organising the march – was attacked inside a restaurant by two masked men wielding baseball bats and knives. Another protester, Max Chung, who organised a march in Yuen Long last month, was beaten by four men wielding rods.The organisers of Saturday’s march, which police had banned, called off the event on Friday fearing mass arrests, but groups of defiant protesters have called for people to come out anyway.“Hongkongers are not afraid. More suppression just leads to more opposition,” one user commented on a protest forum. Another wrote: “Even if they bring the tanks out, I will be there.”Some fear the authorities intend to provoke protesters, creating more public anger and chaos on the streets, as a way to justify enacting the emergency law – a move that would severely damage Hong Kong’s reputation as a global business and finance hub.“The authorities, Carrie Lam in particular, definitely understand that this whole thing could backfire. They could actually be adding more fuel to the fire, and more people will come out,” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker. “They can’t lose. It’s very calculated on their part,” she said.Saturday’s rally was meant to mark five years since Beijing’s proposal for direct elections in Hong Kong, which would only allow candidates screened by Beijing. That proposal sparked mass protests known as the umbrella movement. Many of those in this summer’s demonstrations attended the 2014 protests as young students.Demonstrators planned to gather for a religious rally on Saturday, which requires police approval if more than 30 people attend. University and secondary students have called for a class boycott next week. Demonstrators have also called for a citywide strike on Monday and Tuesday.“We will not stop our fight. We shall never surrender,” Wong said following his release on bail. “Hongkongers, together we stand together!” he posted on Twitter.“I urge the international community to send a clear message to President Xi Jinping: sending troops or using an emergency ordinance is not the way out. We will continue our fight no matter how they arrest or prosecute us.”",Wave of arrests in new push by Hong Kong police to thwart protests,2019-08-30/18:21:26,hong kong police have launched a wave of

"An old Chinese idiom has become the key catchphrase of Hong Kong’s social discourse in recent days. Pien Dei Hoi Fa – flowers blooming everywhere – is the term being used to describe the emergence of local protests and so-called Lennon walls, colourful collages of sticky labels with political messages, that are popping up in local communities all over Hong Kong.Millions in this former British colony have flocked to the streets in several mass protests over the past month to fight against a proposed law that would allow individuals to be extradited to stand trial in China’s opaque courts. Now, feeling emboldened by the solidarity and big turnout at recent protests, which have made headlines across the world, Hong Kong people are now riding on the wave of their success to speak up on a range of issues, which are generally related to their discontent with the encroachment of China into Hong Kong.Over the past weeks, there have already been many smaller scale rallies on the sidelines of the main protests, among them a couple of mothers’ rallies urging the authorities to listen to young people and numerous open-air Christian gatherings urging peace.But many more, with different themes, are in the pipeline: there are at least five planned protests or rallies over the coming week and nine until the end of the month, and lists of these are going viral on social media.On Saturday thousands of people turned out for a Reclaim Sheung Shui protest in a town near the mainland border, a show of anger against so-called parallel traders who snap up goods ranging from foreign-made formula milk to cosmetics and medicines and resell them in China. On Sunday, a rally in Shatin against the extradition bill and a separate journalists’ march on Hong Kong island against the police’s rough handling of reporters are planned. There will be an elderly people’s march to support the young next Wednesday and a rally against pro-Beijing media in the next few weeks.Such frequent protests are rare in Hong Kong, where people are known for their stoical work ethic in a city that has some of the highest property prices in the world and little social welfare provision.Many interviewed by the Observer in the Sheung Shui protest on Saturday said the millions-strong anti-extradition protests last month had become a lightning rod for them. Many have been accumulating pent-up anger against the government for policies they felt they had endured long enough.These have ranged from expensive infrastructure projects aimed at stepping up the integration of China and Hong Kong to planned legislation on the Chinese national flag and anthem to punish those who show disrespect. But there are less political, local issues as well.“Restore Sheung Shui to its former glory!”, “Restore our serenity!” and “Kick out parallel traders!” shouted many in the march attended by thousands on Saturday. They said they resented the government having turned a blind eye to the border town being overrun with parallel traders for over a decade. They accused them of filling the streets with cardboard boxes of commodities and leaving behind piles of rubbish, while neighbourhood shops were squeezed out of business due to high rents and replaced by shops selling goods popular with mainland tourists and traders.“The anti-extradition protests have heightened our awareness over community issues. Instead of waiting for the government to do something, we may as well take it into our own hands,” said Vincent Yeung, a man in his 20s.Others describe the huge anti-extradition protests in the past month as “an awakening” to remind them that China is also eroding Hong Kong’s way of life.“We feel our way of life is being threatened and we’re surrounded by mainland China. I grew up here but now local shops are few and far between,” said a waitress who gave her name as Yo.“We are powered by the same energy [as the anti-extradition protests],” said Alan Leung, a young professional. “People want to keep the momentum going and spread the protests everywhere.”“‘Don’t mess with us’ is the message we want to tell the Chinese and Hong Kong governments,” said Leung, who has participated in past “reclaim” demonstrations, including one last week in Tuen Mun to protest against noisy dance performances by entertainers who also provide sex services.Hong Kong’s culture of protest has its roots in its political system, which gives ordinary people little say in how their city is run.Its leader is not elected by ordinary voters but by an elite committee accountable to Beijing. Only half of the 70-seat legislature is directly elected, while the other 35 seats are occupied by mostly pro-establishment figures from corporate and special interest groups. Moreover, by ejecting six pro-democracy lawmakers and barring candidates seen as pro-independent from running for elections, the Hong Kong government took away the pro-democracy camp’s power to block unpopular policies in the legislature.With the legislature deprived of its checks and balances role, many Hong Kong people say the only way to voice their opposition to government decisions is to take to the streets. Even after a month of several huge protests, the zest for more protests seems unquenchable and there is no sign they are dying down.“This is a spillover effect of a mass movement whose demands were not met by the Carrie Lam government and officials,” said Kenneth Chan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. “Some of the actions are directly related to the government’s failure in handling the extradition saga, but there are also long-drawn-out issues like the impact of ‘mainlandisation’ on Hong Kong communities,” he said.“All these point to a critical issue about the post-1997 governance: there has not been a government properly chosen by the people of Hong Kong; the officials are increasingly seen to work to blur the boundaries between Hong Kong and mainland China.”Over the past few weeks, the anti-extradition movement has not only morphed into a bigger movement encompassing a range of different plights, but has also re-ignited people’s demand for universal suffrage. Many people in recent protests have held up yellow umbrellas, emblems of the 2014 Umbrella civil disobedience movement that tried but failed to press China to grant Hong Kong people an unfettered vote, and shouted “I want genuine universal suffrage!”“People really feel threatened that the government thought it could do whatever it wanted,” said Jean-Philippe Béja, research emeritus professor at the Centre for International Studies and Research at Sciences-Po in Paris. “The extradition bill has crystallised all sorts of discontent and people believe that universal suffrage would solve these problems,” he said. “If they don’t speak up, no one will help them so they’re taking their destiny into their own hands.”But Hong Kong’s political future remains uncertain as its government is beholden to China. China has already decided in 2014 that it will allow “universal suffrage” so long as it can first vet the leadership candidates before Hong Kong people can vote. It has shown no sign of allowing democratisation since.“Hong Kong is facing the world’s most powerful authoritarian regime,” said Chow Po-chung, a professor of government and public administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “The target of people’s resistance is China and [its leader] Carrie Lam has no autonomy.”Willy Lam, a China expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said Lam’s government is now a lame duck with no legitimacy and is awaiting orders from Beijing. While China is yet to properly respond to Hong Kong’s biggest political crisis in decades, he expected Beijing will continue to extend its policies and governance models to Hong Kong.“Hopes have been ignited but the result is not known,” said Lam. “But the Communist party will intensify its rule over Hong Kong.”",'Don't mess with us': the spirit of rebellion spreads in Hong

"The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has stressed “UK support for Hong Kong and its freedoms” as protesters broke into the territory’s legislative chamber on the 22nd anniversary of the handover of sovereignty from Britain to China.The dramatic scenes overshadowed a march of hundreds of thousands of people in opposition to a proposed law allowing for extradition of individuals for trial in mainland China, where the opaque court system is controlled by the Communist party.“UK support for Hong Kong and its freedoms is unwavering on this anniversary day,” Hunt said. “No violence is acceptable but Hong Kong people must preserve the right to peaceful protest exercised within the law, as hundreds of thousands of brave people showed today.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city.

The UK had been privately pressing for the legislation to be dropped altogether.Speaking before the anniversary protests turned violent, Hunt had said the previous protests made it “even more important to reiterate that the UK government’s commitment to the Sino-British joint declaration is unwavering. It is a legally binding treaty and remains as valid today as it did when it was signed and ratified over 30 years ago.”Sensitive to criticism that the UK has not been forceful enough in defence of the rights of Hong Kong citizens in recent weeks, he said it was “imperative that Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, and the rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people, are fully respected in line with the joint declaration and the Hong Kong basic law”.Hunt last week announced he was calling for an independent investigation into police handling of the demonstrations. He also refused to grant any new export licences for crowd control equipment that could be used by Hong Kong police.He said in his statement: “We strongly believe that upholding ‘one country, two systems’ is the best way to ensure Hong Kong continues to play a vital role for China, and to continue its role and reputation as a global financial and trading centre for the rest of the world.”A Foreign Office spokeswoman denied claims by China that the UK was interfering in Hong Kong. “We are co-signatory to the joint declaration, a legally binding treaty deposited at the United Nations.

"On Tuesday, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, attempted to end what has been the territory’s worst political crisis in decades by declaring a controversial extradition bill that set off weeks of protests “dead”. Yet the operative word protesters were looking for was “withdraw”, or chit wui, a key demand of the demonstrators to formally withdraw the bill from parliament. Lam has said the bill, already suspended last month in response to protests, would expire at the end of the legislative session that finishes next July. Instead she used a Cantonese idiom to describe “reaching the end of one’s life”.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongSoon after the press conference, protesters panned her “word games” and vowed to organise further protests if she refused to meet demands. Others said that without the bill’s withdrawal, according to the rules and procedures of the legislature, they could only rely on Lam’s promises that it would not be revived.“She said nothing really. Her personal guarantee is meaningless,” said Yan, a 35-year-old construction worker who asked not to give his full name. “The bill has not been withdrawn and they can still bring it back in another form,” he said.The extradition bill, which critics fear would be used as a political tool by Beijing to bring dissidents and critics of the government to China, has been a lightning rod for discontent in Hong Kong and an example of the erosion of the city’s freedoms under Beijing’s control. The former British colony, returned to China in 1997, is meant to operate with a “high degree of autonomy”, with its own courts and legislature.Lam, elected by a 1,194-member committee dominated by pro-Beijing representatives, has been the focus of much of that discontent, with protesters calling for her removal.“The level of distrust in Lam and her government is so deep at this point that these half measures are unlikely to be accepted and protests will likely continue,” said Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based writer and author of the book, City of Protest.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. Protesters referred to Lam’s track record of going back on promises made to the public, for example that she would resign if the public demanded it. On Tuesday, Lam said she would not be stepping down.Critics say that even if the bill is truly finished, protesters are not likely to be appeased. “The bill is dead, but people don’t trust her anymore,” said Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker with the Civic party.Lam also refused to meet other demonstrator demands, including for the release of those arrested in the protests and an independent investigation into police use of force on protesters on 12 June – when teargas, rubber bullets and truncheons were deployed on largely peaceful crowds.“The campaign will go on. People want concrete results; they are not happy with what they have seen so far,” said Joseph Cheng, a retired political scientist at the City University of Hong Kong.While the demonstrations may decline in scale, Cheng believes protesters will continue. Their demands have gone beyond simply the withdrawal of the bill. Protesters are also urging the government to implement democratic reforms including universal suffrage, a key issue in a previous wave of demonstrations in 2014.“The core of this political movement is the demand for free elections, because all governance crisis stems from political inequality,” said Joshua Wong, a student leader in the 2014 protests and secretary general of the Demosistō party.

"Supporters of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests say they are being intimidated and harassed by pro-Beijing Chinese students and others at their events around the UK, forcing police to step in to separate them from counter-demonstrations.Below-the-radar tensions have boiled over into incidents that include the arrest of a 19-year-old Chinese student after bottles were thrown at a Sheffield event, while police and university security have intervened in other town centres and campuses.Hong Kong activists – who complain they are being filmed and photographed – link the counter-demonstrations to UK-based Chinese student organisations supported by the Chinese government.In London, eggs were thrown at people gathering to attend a concert by Denise Ho – the Hong Kong “Cantopop” star and activist blacklisted in mainland China – where a crowd waved a large Chinese  flag and shouted pro-Beijing slogans.In an apparent nod to a pejorative term used by opponents of Hong Kong activists, some also carried placards with images of cockroaches and the words in Chinese: “It’s everyone’s duty to eradicate pests.”Re-edit: Was at @hoccgoomusic's concert on Fri to photo pro-Beijing protesters.

"Ellie Lau, a 21-year-old student, was one of thousands of protesters who flooded Hong Kong’s airport this week. There, she and a friend had an uneasy conversation about the future.As they joined throngs of demonstrators dressed in black sitting on the floor of the arrivals hall they talked about exhaustion and uncertainty – emotions they have suppressed over the past two months of protesting against their government.“It’s already very hard for us. All the people I know are all very tired physically and mentally. We don’t know what we should or can do,” says Lau. “I will ask myself, ‘What else can I give up for this movement for the future of Hong Kong?’ We don’t usually talk about it, but we are all thinking about it.”Hong Kong’s biggest political crisis for decades, triggered in June by its determination to push ahead with an extradition bill that to many represented Beijing’s tightening hold over the city, has reached a stalemate. Campaigners are frustrated that weeks of protests – including peaceful rallies, mass disruptions of the city and violent clashes – have failed to force the government to respond.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongCity authorities, backed by Beijing, have cracked down harder. Police have arrested more than 700 people and the Chinese military have held warning exercises along the border. Yet people continue to come out in droves.As the protests enter their 11th consecutive week and resolution appears even more remote, the question of what happens next looms.“People don’t quite know what is coming. Each weekend seems like it could be decisive,” said Kong Tsung-gan, a writer and activist. “I know people who say they’ve been waking up in recent days and the first thing they wonder is whether the troops have moved in and declared martial law. The rational side of them says that’s probably not the case, but it’s a feeling of foreboding.”Hong Kong, a former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997, is meant to maintain certain freedoms under a treaty framework known as “one country, two systems”. But critics say those freedoms, including of speech, are being eroded as Beijing exerts more control.Protesters are demanding a permanent withdrawal of the now suspended bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China, as well as an independent inquiry into the use of police force. Hong Kong’s chief executive Carrie Lam has refused the demands, insisting that the government has already responded to public opposition to the bill.Observers say the coming days could mark a turning point, a gauge of momentum as residents, protesters and police have been pushed to their limits. On Sunday people were preparing to attend a mass march which has been banned by police – the third consecutive day of mass rallies and the largest protest in weeks.On Friday thousands of demonstrators dressed in black filled Chater Garden, a public square in central Hong Kong, to call on the international community for help. On Saturday teachers filled the same square to protest at police brutality against students.Tensions reached a new level last week. Police dressed as protesters arrested demonstrators last weekend, wrestling them to the ground and beating them with batons. A first aid volunteer was reportedly blinded in one eye by a bean bag round fired by police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into a public transit station, shooting protesters at close range.The protesters responded by paralysing Hong Kong airport on Monday and Tuesday, blocking passengers from checking into their flights and clashing with police. In one instance, demonstrators surrounded a police officer, beating him with his own baton until he pulled out a pistol and aimed it at the crowd.In scenes prompting widespread criticism, another group tied down two men suspected of being spies and blocked emergency services from reaching one who had collapsed. On Tuesday Lam asked protesters to think of their city. “Do you wish to push it into an abyss and smash it into pieces?” she asked, close to tears.The current deadlock and heightened violence has prompted a moment of re-evaluation and for some soul-searching. On online forums, protesters are reminding each other to remember their original purpose. Others have called for a code of conduct for dealing with suspected spies in the future. Some went to the airport, bowing their heads to passing travellers and holding up written apologies.“They have already done what they did. What can we do aside from remind ourselves what we are doing and continue?” says Lau.Protesters, divided in two camps known as the “fighters” who believe disruption and force are necessary to force the government to respond and a group known as the “peaceful, rational and non-violent”, have largely agreed to let the peaceful camp take the reins for the weekend.Sunday’s protest was meant to be a return to earlier peaceful methods, aiming to show the protests still have broad support from society.“This Sunday should be another million-strong march. Hong Kong people can’t be defeated, Hongkongers soldier on,” Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy politician, wrote on Facebook.As views over what to do next diverge, demonstrators are trying new forms of protest.Last week, protesters withdrew money en masse from cashpoints in the hope of destabilising the banking system. Medical workers rallied at hospitals and more than 300 civil servants issued a second letter condemning their government. Secondary school pupils have pledged to boycott classes a day a week when school resumes next month.“Now citizens are just trying to bring out as much creativity as we can,” said Elizabeth Yu, 26, a musician and teacher who was at Friday’s rally. “Sometimes I feel like it makes us lose focus but at the same time this shows the diversity of citizens who are trying to speak out.”Yu, like many, is worried about how much longer the protests can be sustained. “The protest to me now is like a pot of boiling water, the steam is hot. The only problem is when the water is all boiled out,” she said.The protest is like a pot of boiling water, the steam is hot. The only problem is when the water is all boiled outOthers are focusing on lobbying other countries to help break the stalemate. Demonstrators have organised rallies in Taiwan, Japan, the UK, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany, France, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the US to coincide with this weekend’s protests. British and American citizens were urged at Friday’s rally to call on their governments to condemn or sanction Beijing and the Hong Kong government.In a video broadcast at the rally, Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour party, said: “The UK must not sit idly by as Hongkongers lose their rights and freedoms.” He called on the British government to “scope out the steps it can take” to apply pressure.Experts say a growing international response could make a difference. Reacting to police tactics last weekend, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday that it had seen “credible evidence” that Hong Kong law enforcement was violating international norms. President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to treat Hong Kong “humanely” and suggested Xi meet Hong Kong protesters.“It has gotten more complicated in that it is no longer a domestic issue. Over the last week, the whole contest has suddenly become much more international,” said Ma Ngok, an associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.According to Ma, international pressure may restrain Beijing, which has described the protesters as “near terrorists” looking to foment a “colour revolution,” language that prompted concerns of a violent crackdown, reminiscent of the crushing of protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.“I think Beijing may also be re-evaluating its strategy because of all these responses. I think they are constrained by not being able to further raise the level of violence by the police,” he said.Some analysts believe the protests face a deadline of 1 October, when China celebrates 70 years since the People’s Republic of China was founded. Protesters also see this as their last chance to put pressure on the central government, eager to end the unrest before the politically significant anniversary.Whether the protests dissipate or are put down, authorities face a long-term problem.“The Chinese communist party [CCP] has lost Hong Kong for the foreseeable future. Not only that, but the people who represent the future, the young people, are the ones most opposed to the CCP,” said Kong. “It can hold on to Hong Kong but it can’t control Hong Kong.”For Lau, who plans to continue for as long as she can, the answer is clear. “We can’t stop. For those who sacrificed, not just those who were injured but those arrested and charged, those who have given their life blood and future or relationship with family – we have to continue for them.”",Hong Kong’s dilemma: fight or resist peacefully,2019-08-18/08:00:06,ellie lau a  year old student was one of thousands of protesters who flooded hong kong s airport this week there she and a friend had an uneasy conversation about the future as they joined throngs of demonstrators dressed in black sitting on the floor of the arrivals hall they talked about exhaustion and uncertainty emotions they have suppressed over the past two months of protesting against their government it s already very hard for us all the people i know are all very tired physically and mentally we don t know what we should or can do says lau i will ask myself what else can i give up for this movement for the future of hong kong we don t usually talk about it but we are all thinking about it hong kong s biggest political crisis for decades triggered in june by its determination to push ahead with an extradition bill that to many represented beijing s tightening hold over the city has reached a stalemate campaigners are frustrated that weeks of protests including peaceful rallies mass disruptions of the city and violent clashes have failed to force the government to respond the protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland china where the communist party controls the courts but have since evolved into a broader pro democracy movement public anger fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world s most expensive densely populated cities the protest movement was given fresh impetus on  july when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station while authorities seemingly did little to intervene underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro beijing establishment rather than by direct elections protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met such as the resignation of the city s leader carrie lam an independent inquiry into police tactics an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill lam announced on  september that she was withdrawing the bill beijing s influence over hong kong has grown in recent years as activists have been jailed and pro democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office independent booksellers have disappeared from the city before reappearing in mainland china facing charges under the terms of the agreement by which the former british colony was returned to chinese control in  the semi autonomous region was meant to maintain a high degree of autonomy through an independent judiciary a free press and an open market economy a framework known as one country two systems the extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give beijing the ability to try pro democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city s semi autonomous government to deal with the situation meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are fanning the fire of unrest in the city china s top diplomat yang jiechi has ordered the us to immediately stop interfering in hong kong affairs in any form lily kuo and verna yu in hong kongcity authorities backed by beijing have cracked down harder police have arrested more than  people and the chinese military have held warning exercises along the border yet people continue to come out in droves as the protests enter their th consecutive week and resolution appears even more remote the question of what happens next looms people don t quite know what is coming each weekend seems like it could be decisive said kong tsung gan a writer and activist i know people who say they ve been waking up in recent days and the first thing they wonder is whether the troops have moved in and declared martial law the rational side of them says that s probably not the case but it s a feeling of foreboding hong kong a former british colony returned to chinese control in  is meant to maintain certain freedoms under a treaty framework known as one country two systems but critics say those freedoms including of speech are being eroded as beijing exerts more control protesters are demanding a permanent withdrawal of the now suspended bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland china as well as an independent inquiry into the use of police force hong kong s chief executive carrie lam has refused the demands insisting that the government has already responded to public opposition to the bill observers say the coming days could mark a turning point a gauge of momentum as residents

"Hong Kong police have shot a protester with live ammunition for the first time in four months of demonstrations, marking a major escalation in the use of force on a day when China celebrated 70 years of Communist party rule with a triumphalist military parade. Protests called to mark a “national day of grief” drew tens of thousands of people on to the city’s streets, across six areas, in the most widespread show yet of public anger towards Beijing.Some gathered in central Hong Kong, while others met up across the harbour in Kowloon and the New Territories beyond. Initially peaceful, the demonstrations turned into running battles that in some places ran on past midnight. Authorities shut down nearly half the city’s metro stations in an attempt to contain the violence.Police in full riot gear used water cannon and barrages of teargas, while protesters threw molotov cocktails, built barricades, attacked metro stations and lit fires in the street.The scenes, though extremely violent, did not mark a departure from previous protests until mid-afternoon, when a policeman fired a bullet into an 18-year-old high school student’s chest in Tsuen Wan district.Images shared by local media showed the protester lying on the ground begging for help as he bled from his injury. “Send me to hospital, my chest is hurting. I need to go to hospital,” he said.Although warning shots have been fired during other protests, police have caused serious injury with rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, and groups including Amnesty International have condemned excessive use of force, this was the first time someone has been hit with a live round.A video posted by the Hong Kong University Students Union appeared to show the policeman shooting the student at point blank range with a pistol, as a group of protesters attacked another officer.Commissioner of police Stephen Lo Wai-chung said the use of a live round was “lawful and reasonable”, and the man had been arrested for assaulting a police officer after he was taken to hospital.The officer opened fire after protesters attacked a policeman who was lying on the ground, Lo told the SCMP. “So when an officer felt that officers’ lives were under serious threat, he fired a live round.” Six live rounds were fired in total during the protests on Tuesday, he added.The UK said the use of live ammunition was “disproportionate”, while Amnesty International called for an urgent and independent investigation.Crowds gathered in central Hong Kong, where police were using water cannon and teargas, fell silent when they heard someone had been shot.But violence soon resumed, and in some places intensified, as protesters faced off with police into the evening. Later a journalist from the local RTHK network was taken to hospital after a projectile hit him in the face, prompting the network to withdraw all its reporters from the streets.Health authorities said at least 66 people were injured in protests, the youngest only 11 and the oldest 75. Two were in a critical condition, and two in a serious condition.Hong Kong has been gripped by protests since June. Sparked by a controversial extradition bill, they have morphed into a wider and increasingly violent anti-government movement channelling residents’ anger and frustration at the erosion of rights under Chinese rule.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said her government will formally withdraw the bill that ignited months of protests. Hong Kong residents had feared it could be used by China to extradite people for political reasons. They want guarantees that it cannot be reintroduced at a later date.Protesters want the government to officially recognise that their movement has been a series of legitimate protests, rather than a riot, as has been stated in official communications.Hundreds of people have been arrested in recent weeks, and the protesters are demanding that all of them be freed, and that no convictions should stand against any of them.Police use of force has escalated since the demonstrations began, while protesters have also resorted to increasingly violent measures. Demonstrators say an inquiry into police brutality is the number-one priority.Hong Kong's chief executive is currently selected by a 1,200-member committee, and nearly half of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by limited electorates representing different sectors of the economy. The protesters want to be able to vote for their leaders in free and open democratic elections. Tuesday’s marchers had already defied a police ban to turn out in large numbers. Organisers wanted to mark the 70th anniversary of communist China as a day of mourning not celebration, and tens of thousands came out in response.“We want to show people this is not a happy anniversary,” said Richard Hung, who works in the technology sector. “The CCP [Chinese Communist party] has killed or injured so many millions of people already. We have come out today, because if we don’t, we may not have another chance.”For the first few hours, the main march through the city centre was peaceful, with protesters dressed largely in black singing “glory to Hong Kong”, scattering paper money used for funeral offerings, and scrawling protest slogans on streets, bus stations and shops seen as pro-Beijing.A new Hong Kong extradition law is proposed, which would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for a variety of crimes. Residents fear it could lead to politically motivated extraditions into China's much harsher judicial system.Large public demonstrations start as thousands march in the streets to protest against the extradition bill.Hong Kong lawmakers scuffle in parliament during a row over the law.Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences, but critics say they are not enough.The scale of protests continues to increase as more than half a million people take to the streets. Police use rubber bullets and teargas against the biggest protests Hong Kong has seen for decades.Lam says the proposed extradition law has been postponed indefinitely.The protests continue as demonstrators storm the Legislative Council, destroying pictures, daubing graffiti on the walls and flying the old flag of Hong Kong emblazoned with the British union flag. The protests coincide with the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the UK back to China.Armed men in white T-shirts thought to be supporting the Chinese government attack passengers and passers-by in Yuen Long metro station, while nearby police take no action.44 protesters are charged with rioting, which further antagonises the anti-extradition bill movement.By now the protest movement has coalesced around five key demands: complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, withdrawal of the use of the word ""riot"" in relation to the protests, unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped, an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of genuine universal suffrage.The mass protests enter their fifteenth week, with police resorting to teargas and water cannon against the demonstrators, and a wave of ""doxxing"" using digital techniques to unmask police and protesters as a new front in the battle.Police shoot a protester with live ammunition for the first time, as demonstrations continue on the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People's Republic of China.The first charges are brought against protesters for covering their faces, after authorities bring in new laws banning face masks in order to make it easier to identify or detain protesters.Hong Kong officials spark outrage in the city as it revealed that nearly a third of protesters arrested since June have been children. Seven hundred and 50 out of the 2,379 people arrested  were under 18, and 104 were under 16.Lam is forced to deliver a key annual policy speech via video link after after being heckled in parliament, as the legislative council resumed sessions after it was suspended on 12 June. Later in the day one of the protest leaders, Jimmy Sham, was attacked by assailants wielding hammers and knives.Chan Tong-kai, the murder suspect whose case prompted the original extradition bill is released from prison, saying that he is willing to surrender himself to Taiwan. The extradition bill is also formally withdrawn, a key demand of protesters.Graffiti included anti-China messages mocking the day’s celebrations across the border, calls for freedom and democracy, and a warning with a prophetic ring that has become a protest staple: “if you burn, we burn with you”.Many families and young children were among the crowds at first. “You can see, we don’t have any protective gear,” said Terrence, a logistics worker walking with his eight-year-old daughter. “We want freedom, and don’t want to belong to China.”Still, a large proportion of protesters wore face masks or carried umbrellas, to stop them being filmed or identified by authorities who have already arrested hundreds. Some have been charged with rioting, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years.Police had said ahead of Tuesday that they feared violent protests, and made a string of raids and arrests, claiming to have uncovered bomb-making equipment and ingredients.Aggressive policing and the scale of the recent violence fuelled fears that authorities might use it as a pretext to bring in draconian emergency legislation, which would allow the government to arrest people at will, and control the press and communications, in the name of stability.“It seems there is no sign of this coming to an end until the government is determined to clamp down,” said pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, who has previously called for an emergency law, in a statement carried by the South China Morning Post.The day began with an episode of police aggression, when officers used pepper spray on a small group of protesters outside the government’s official flag-raising ceremony and national day reception, which was closed to the public.It was calm throughout the morning, as Beijing celebrated its anniversary and rise to super-power status with a military parade showing off its latest hardware, and a civilian procession celebrating everything from communist heroes to agriculture and bicycles.After more than 20 years of civil war, Mao Zedong leads the communists to victory over the nationalists, and proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China on 1 October.China launches a five-year economic plan, the ""Great Leap Forward"",  collectivising farming and investing in heavy industry.

The following year it becomes the world's second-largest economy, over-taking Japan.The Chinese economic ""miracle"" falters, as growth falls to its lowest level for 25 years.China becomes increasingly embroiled in a trade war with the US.A series of major pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong challenge Chinese rule there. The country's human rights record also comes under scrutiny for its treatment of the Uighurs, with claims that more than 1 million of them have been detained in camps the Chinese have euphemistically called “vocational education centres”.Hong Kong’s protesters began turning out only after those events wrapped up, preparing their own response to mark the day.“It’s National Day but there is nothing to be happy about in Hong Kong,” said Sarah, 17. “We’re under one party rule and the Communist party controls our government.”",Hong Kong protester shot with live round during China National Day

"Yuen Long, a quiet residential area close to the Chinese border, has become the unlikely next battleground of Hong Kong’s protest movement.Over the last seven weeks, demonstrators have planned rallies across the territory – in parks, along main roads, in the airport and outside government offices – calling for the withdrawal of an extradition bill and making other political demands. But Yuen Long, known as one of the more remote, isolated areas in the north-west, had never been on the agenda.On Sunday that changed. Commuters returning from dinner, going to meet friends or some coming back from the pro-democracy rally in central Hong Kong, pulled into the mass transit station to find dozens of men in white T-shirts waiting for them. They were masked, armed with rattan rods and other weapons.Over the next half hour, passengers were chased, punched and lashed. Some frantically dialled emergency services but got no response. Police arrived after the assailants had gone and left before the men came back a second time. At least 45 people were sent to hospital. The attack stunned locals, and many suspected the involvement of organised crime groups, the triads, which are active in the villages surrounding Yuen Long. Opposition lawmakers accused authorities of colluding with organised crime groups. Police arrested 12 people in connection with the attack, some with triad backgrounds.I’m scared. I think all Hongkongers are scaredIn the immediate aftermath Yuen Long became a ghost town: shops across the main strip were closed and the streets were empty. Some locals rented hotel rooms out of town for a few nights.As businesses gradually returned to normal, residents began bracing themselves for clashes between protesters, the police and suspected gangsters this weekend, as as previously planned demonstration in Kowloon, a commercial and residential district closer to central Hong Kong, on Saturday, was cancelled in order to hold a march in Yuen Long. “Before the terrorist attack, none of the people are coming to Yuen Long for protest,” said Max Chung, 39, a resident of Yuen Long who submitted paperwork to the police for the march this weekend. “We have our local issues, our local problems but it hasn’t really been that serious until the attacks. That’s why I was so surprised the villagers are so against the movement.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongMei, who runs a noodle restaurant near the train station, had reopened its doors on Tuesday. At 7pm her restaurant was half full. “I’m scared. I think all Hongkongers are scared,” she said.Aubree Au, 39, said she was shocked and horrified by news of the attack, and unable to sleep that night as she watched live updates of what was happening. “It was literally a gangster movie in real life,” she said. It continued to affect her. “It hurts,” she said. “I was terrified, knowing it was where I live.”A former satellite town built by the British in the 1970s and used for years as farmland, Yuen Long is still largely conservative and dominated by village traditions, according to Chung. Pro-Beijing and pro-establishment sentiment is strong, especially in the villages where the triads are believed to have the support of local authorities and Chinese public security.Yet residents are also frustrated by China’s encroachment into their lives. They blame Chinese tourists and parallel traders, who can reach Yuen Long in half an hour by bus from Shenzhen, for driving up real estate and living costs and crowding their streets.Many in Yuen Long may agree with the demonstrators but choose not to say so, given how polarising the topic is, according to Fong, 60, a caretaker from the area. “A lot of people in Yuen Long do support the protesters, but they won’t say it out loud. There’s a large silent majority,” he said.Fong has been supportive of his son who has been at the protests. Fong who says he is “incredibly angry” at what he believes is the obvious collusion between the police and the triads, plans to attend Saturday’s march. “I’m not scared,” he said. “Hong Kong people care about these things. We all know it matters.”Not all residents – from Yuen Long or elsewhere – may be as brave as Fong and his son. This time protesters fear the triads, whose presence is usually visible only through the scattering of mahjong parlours, brothels advertised as massage services, and other businesses in Yuen Long. “Normally, they don’t hurt people. They’re businesspeople,” said Fong.Before the attack on Sunday, posters had circulated online warning people not to come to Yuen Long and set up Lennon Walls – named for the wall daubed with John Lennon-inspired political graffiti in Prague – or else they would have their hands and legs “chopped”. The heads of several Hong Kong universities issued a letter making the “strongest plea” to students not to attend.“You will have angry young people from various parts of Hong Kong and the triads may gather from all over Hong Kong. I’m worried and ordinary people are worried,” said Joseph Cheng, a retired political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong.Despite the warning, on Tuesday evening commuters passing through the same station where Sunday’s attack took place had covered the walls, columns and railings with photos of the victims, photos of the attackers posing with their weapons, hundreds of sticky notes, and signs that said “Take Back Yuen Long”. A group of volunteers who had heard about the wall online had come to guard passersby posting things there.For Kay To, 29, a protester from Yuen Long, the attacks have made people in this normally peaceful district think about their safety, their role as citizens and the responsibilities of their leaders.“They are starting to care,” he said. “In Yuen Long we never had a protest maybe in these 100 years. There have been a lot of first times for Yuen Long.” ",'All Hongkongers are scared': protests to widen as rural residents fight back,2019-07-25/03:00:32,yuen long a quiet residential area close to the

"Thousands of people turned out in heavy rain across Hong Kong on Sunday to denounce a ban on face masks, brought in under sweeping colonial-era emergency powers in the city government’s latest attempt to stem a four-month-old protest movement.Instead of cowing protesters, the ban has enraged them. Crowds shouting “Hong Kong resist” and “wearing a mask is not a crime” marched through the city centre, Kowloon district and several other areas under a sea of umbrellas.The first few hours were peaceful but in late afternoon the protests slipped into violence after police tried to disperse the crowds. They fired teargas and used rubber bullets and pepper spray; protesters responded with bricks and molotov cocktails, and vandalised businesses thought to be pro-China.China’s military also warned protesters they could be arrested for targeting the People’s Liberation Army barracks with laser lights, the first direct interaction between China’s military and Hong Kong’s protesters, Reuters reported. They unfurled a yellow flag with the arrest warning on their roof.Earlier on Sunday judges had refused a second attempt to get an injunction against the mask ban, but agreed to a judicial review of the chief executive Carrie Lam’s use of emergency powers. The court did not set a date but indicated it would be this month.This is the first time in more than half a century that Hong Kong’s government has activated the emergency regulations ordinance, which gives Lam virtually unlimited power. Critics say it is unjustified, and a first step towards authoritarianism.“We are frightened and furious. It is exactly because we are frightened that we need to come out and march,” said one protester, a graduate of the same school as Lam, carrying a school banner.“We wanted to say she has brought shame on our school. And to remind her of our motto: ‘Live by the truth in love.’ We feel she violates it.”Like almost everyone else at the marches, the protester wore a mask, even though that is an offence that now carries a fine and up to a year in jail. Police said they made the first arrests for violating it on Sunday.Masks have been common at marches for months, because people fear that if they are caught on camera and identified by the authorities they could be arrested or face retaliation in the future.Lam claimed the ban was the only way to restore order to a city that has been convulsed by the protests for nearly four months. More than 1,120 people have been injured, more than 2,000 arrested, thousands of rounds of teargas fired and two teenage students seriously wounded by live ammunition.But since she unveiled it on Friday, the new law appears to have deepened Hong Kong’s crisis, prompting three straight days of chaos.“If the law is allowed to stand, we don’t have any future, that’s why we have come here,” said one 23-year-old marching on Sunday with a group of friends. “Nowadays all Hong Kong people are fighters.”On Saturday, protesters had called for a “day of rest” before Sunday’s larger protests but the city was virtually paralysed after authorities closed the entire metro system, and many banks, supermarkets and other businesses decided to shut for the day.The protests were originally sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent for trial in mainland China, but have swelled into a much broader movement with goals including greater democracy and an independent investigation of police brutality.It is the biggest political crisis for the territory since the handover from British colonial rule in 1997, and one of the most serious challenges to China’s strongman leader, Xi Jinping, since he took power.Although Hong Kong is officially self-ruled under the agreement that ended colonial rule, its leader is effectively handpicked by Beijing, and ultimately answers to the Communist party leadership there.Worries about media safety also deepened on Sunday after police detained and beat one journalist, and protesters hit another reporter with a molotov cocktail. Several correspondents have been injured, and one lost her sight in one eye after she was hit in the face by a rubber bullet fired at short range.",Thousands on streets of Hong Kong rage against mask ban,2019-10-06/15:12:23,thousands of people turned out in heavy rain across hong kong on sunday to denounce a ban on face masks brought in under sweeping colonial era emergency powers in the city government s latest attempt to stem a four month old protest movement instead of cowing protesters the ban has enraged them crowds shouting hong kong resist and wearing a mask is not a crime marched through the city centre kowloon district and several other areas under a sea of umbrellas the first few hours were peaceful but in late afternoon the protests slipped into violence after police tried to disperse the crowds they fired teargas and used rubber bullets and pepper spray protesters responded with bricks and molotov cocktails and vandalised businesses thought to be pro china china s military also warned protesters they could be arrested for targeting the people s liberation army barracks with laser lights the first direct interaction between china s military and hong kong s protesters  reported they unfurled a yellow flag with the arrest warning on their roof earlier on sunday judges had refused a second attempt to get an injunction against the mask ban but agreed to a judicial review of the chief executive carrie lam s use of emergency powers the court did not set a date but indicated it would be this month this is the first time in more than half a century that hong kong s government has activated the emergency regulations ordinance which gives lam virtually unlimited power critics say it is unjustified and a first step towards authoritarianism we are frightened and furious it is exactly because we are frightened that we need to come out and march said one protester a graduate of the same school as lam carrying a school banner we wanted to say she has brought shame on our school and to remind her of our motto live by the truth in love we feel she violates it like almost everyone else at the marches the protester wore a mask even though that is an offence that now carries a fine and up to a year in jail police said they made the first arrests for violating it on sunday masks have been common at marches for months because people fear that if they are caught on camera and identified by the authorities they could be arrested or face retaliation in the future lam claimed the ban was the only way to restore order to a city that has been convulsed by the protests for nearly four months more than   people have been injured more than   arrested thousands of rounds of teargas fired and two teenage students seriously wounded by live ammunition but since she unveiled it on friday the new law appears to have deepened hong kong s crisis prompting three straight days of chaos if the law is allowed to stand we don t have any future that s why we have come here said one  year old marching on sunday with a group of friends nowadays all hong kong people are fighters on saturday protesters had called for a day of rest before sunday s larger protests but the city was virtually paralysed after authorities closed the entire metro system and many banks supermarkets and other businesses decided to shut for the day the protests were originally sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent for trial in mainland china but have swelled into a much broader movement with goals including greater democracy and an independent investigation of police brutality it is the biggest political crisis for the territory since the handover from british colonial rule in  and one of the most serious challenges to china s strongman leader xi jinping since he took power although hong kong is officially self ruled under the agreement that ended colonial rule its leader is effectively handpicked by beijing and ultimately answers to the communist party leadership there worries about media safety also deepened on sunday after police detained and beat one journalist and protesters hit another reporter with a molotov cocktail several correspondents have been injured and one lost her sight in one eye after she was hit in the face by a rubber bullet fired at short range ,Hong Kong Protests,0.249627531
"The messages from Beijing to protesters in Hong Kong are increasingly ominous. First there was propaganda footage of Chinese soldiers garrisoned in Hong Kong drilling for intense urban fighting that looked more like a civil war than search and rescue or crowd control.Now footage has emerged of armoured paramilitary vehicles massing across the border. Two months into demonstrations sparked by a controversial extradition law, official rhetoric from Beijing has escalated too. Authorities recently denounced protests as “terrorist acts”, promised an “iron fist” response and, perhaps most alarmingly, described the movement as a “colour revolution”.China considered the pro-democracy protests which swept across the former Soviet Union during the early years of this century, most prominently Ukraine’s 2004 Orange Revolution, to be existential threats to be tackled at almost any cost. Putting the same label on protesters implies Beijing will stop at little to crush the movement.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office.

China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongThe question many are now asking in Hong Kong is whether that might include Chinese troops in the city’s streets, or if Beijing is simply trying to frighten protesters into backing down by publicly flaunting its military muscle.As protesters and Hong Kong authorities become more entrenched in their positions, and hopes for a compromise dim, the reality may be that China is considering both options, said Prof Steve Tsang, the director of the Soas China Institute.“I don’t think we should see it in a binary way; it’s not either/or. A huge amount of that [rhetoric and footage] is clearly intimidation, but potentially they could also use them,” he said.“If they truly see what’s happening in Hong Kong as a colour revolution, they will do whatever it takes [to stop it], which is why I feel we are on much more dangerous ground than a few weeks ago.”The protest movement took off just days after the 30th anniversary of the slaughter around Tiananmen Square and the shadow of the 1989 bloodshed hangs over all discussions of Hong Kong’s fate.Beijing is as aware of that grim precedent as protesters on the ground, of the international revulsion, and the political and economic isolation that followed.Any deployment of the People’s Liberation Army would also be hugely damaging to Hong Kong and its economy, and so Beijing is likely to want to keep that only as a last resort.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. “The deployment of PLA troops, however controlled and contained it might seem, will mean the end of Hong Kong and its rapid decline,” said Kenneth Chan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University.That would be a big hit for China at a damaging time. The country’s population is ageing, economic growth hit a 30-year low this year, and the national balance sheet is weighed down by huge debt incurred during the boom years.Instead, Chan said he expected Beijing to explore other ways of crushing protests, through a combination of harsher policing, and political and economic pressure.They may include “massive arrests by police and escalation of state-sanctioned violence against the activists and protesters; economic sanctions against businesses; censorship and other hidden forms of pressures against universities, civil society groups and the pro-democracy movement”, he said.The PLA garrison in the city, estimated by Hong Kong’s legislature at between 8,000 and 10,000 troops, would be on standby as both last resort and source of pressure, he added.Looming over the protests is a deadline of sorts, though. The 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China falls on 1 October. It will be celebrated with a military parade and other activities around the country, and China’s autocratic president, Xi Jinping, is unlikely to want it overshadowed by events in Hong Kong.Perhaps the biggest question for the future of Hong Kong and its protesters is what he might consider more of a spoiler – crowds still clogging the streets of Hong Kong in a dramatic, democratic denunciation of Xi’s “China dream”, or celebrations held in the bleak wake of a bloody crackdown.",China flaunts military muscle as it seeks to quell Hong Kong's ‘colour revolution’,2019-08-13/19:00:06,the

"The leader of Hong Kong’s government has said she remains determined to pass a proposed extradition law despite a huge protest march against the legislation on Sunday that drew hundreds of thousands of people.The bill creates a system for case-by-case fugitive transfers between semi-autonomous Hong Kong and regions with which it does not already have agreements, including mainland China.Opponents of the law say it is being pushed by the Chinese government, and fear that Beijing will use it to extradite activists, dissidents and other political opponents who will end up in China’s opaque and politicised courts.Striking a defiant tone on Monday, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said: “This bill is not initiated by the [Chinese] central people’s government. I have not received any instruction.” Opposition to the bill was a result of a misunderstanding, she added.The bill’s supporters say it plugs existing loopholes and will prevent the city from becoming a bolthole for fugitives. Hong Kong’s administration is determined to pass the bill before July, and has pegged its urgency on the case of a man wanted for the murder of his girlfriend in Taiwan.“Hong Kong has to move on,” Lam said. “Nobody wants Hong Kong to be a fugitive offenders’ haven.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongOn Sunday hundreds of thousands of people marched in opposition to the bill. Organisers estimate that 1 million people took part in the march – which would make it the city’s biggest protest since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997 – although police put the figure at 240,000 at its peak.The protests were peaceful until midnight, when police and demonstrators clashed after attempts to disperse some remaining protesters from the area outside the legislative offices.Another rally will be held on Wednesday, when the second reading of the bill will be debated by legislators.Martin Lee, a leading barrister, former legislator, and key figure of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, told the Guardian he believed there would be lots more protests if the government did not adequately respond to Sunday’s enormous public showing. Lee said the government was “saying no to democracy and suppressing human rights and the rule of law”.There is widespread fear in Hong Kong of Beijing’s increasing encroachment into the city, 22 years after it was was returned from British rule to exist under the “one country, two systems” regime, which guarantees it an independent legal system.Lam said the size of the demonstration showed there were “clearly still concerns” about the bill, but the fact that so many people had taken part showed the city was still free. “I think they clearly demonstrate that these rights and freedoms are as robust as ever,” she said.China’s ministry of foreign affairs said it continued to firmly support Hong Kong in passing the bill. The ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing “resolutely opposes” the interference of “external forces” in Hong Kong’s legislative affairs. In an editorial on Monday, the state-owned China Daily defended the legislation and blamed opposition parties and “foreign forces” for creating chaos in Hong Kong.“Any fair-minded person would deem the amendment bill a legitimate, sensible and reasonable piece of legislation that would strengthen Hong Kong’s rule of law and deliver justice,” it said, adding that Hong Kong residents had been “hoodwinked” by the opposition camp and their “foreign allies”.“Some foreign forces are seizing the opportunity to advance their own strategy to hurt China by trying to create havoc in Hong Kong,” the paper said.",Hong Kong protests: government vows to push ahead with extradition bill,2019-06-10/09:54:20,the leader of hong kong s government has said she remains determined to pass a proposed

"Brian Chan, a 23-year-old university graduate, was having his arms rinsed in saline water at a makeshift first-aid station manned by volunteers. Both his arms were red from an allergic reaction after he was pepper-sprayed by police at the mass rally against an extradition law under a sweltering sun on Wednesday.Asked what he would do if the bill was passed, Chan looked pensively into the distance. “We don’t want to get violent and it’s wrong, but if the government keeps ignoring us, we can’t rule out escalating our actions.”After the end of last Sunday’s estimated million-strong mass demonstration against the bill, which could result in suspects being sent to mainland China, the Hong Kong government issued a statement saying it noted the “peaceful and orderly” march but would resume the second reading of the bill in the legislature on Wednesday as planned.An hour later, the scene turned ugly. Shortly after midnight, hundreds of protesters tried to storm the legislative council building, throwing metal barriers and bottles and rushing towards the police line outside. Hong Kong’s top leader, Carrie Lam, condemned the violence and refused to retract the bill.At Wednesday’s mass rally, which filled the streets outside the legislature and spilled over on to the dual carriageways in Admiralty, a downtown business district, at least a dozen, mainly young protesters, told the Guardian it was the government’s refusal to listen that had prompted them to stage another rally. They said they simply had no other way to make their voices heard.Later that afternoon, riot police used rubber bullets, batons and teargas against protesters. In several cases, crowds charged at armed officers, throwing bottles and other debris.Some unarmed protesters were shot at by police and several were arrested as they sought treatment in hospitals. At least 72 people were taken to hospital and two were in a serious condition.Analysts warn that frustrations, particularly among the young, could boil over into even bigger and more violent confrontations if the Hong Kong government continued to ignore people’s voices.After a long day of protest in sweltering heat on Wednesday, a young man and woman talked to the Guardian about their frustration and sense of helplessness in the face of their rights being increasingly infringed upon by China. On the subject of protesters increasingly resorting to violence, the young people, who declined to give their names, said it was “inevitable” as they had exhausted all peaceful channels. “It’s useless talking to them. They never listen to us.”Ching Cheong, a veteran journalist who was jailed in mainland China for three years on trumped-up espionage charges, blamed the government for pushing the unpopular law in the face of opposition from groups across a diverse political spectrum, including the legal sector and even some pro-Beijing figures.“They have completely ignored all the peaceful, rational and non-violent expressions. The frustrations are felt across the board,” he said. “The students’ emotions are just an expression of Hong Kong society. They feel there is no way out.”Hong Kong’s government has taken an increasingly hard line on dissent in the years since the 2014 Occupy Central mass civil disobedience movement, jailing protesters and leaders, banning activists from standing for election and disqualifying  elected pro-democracy lawmakers for flouting regulations at a swearing-in ceremony.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. Young people have also learned to be more protective of themselves than a few years ago.On the surface, the scene on Wednesday looked like the 79-day Occupy Movement in 2014. Volunteers were handing out food, water bottles, towels and snacks at makeshift supply stations, which also gave out protective gear such as face masks, goggles, umbrellas and hard hats.But despite the air of solidarity, people were reluctant to reveal their identity to reporters, refusing to be photographed and mostly declining to give their names and ages. When a Guardian reporter was interviewing a teenager in an underground station on Wednesday, his friends swiftly pulled him away.And unlike the Occupy Movement, whose charismatic founders such as Prof Benny Tai and Prof Chan Kin Man, or young leaders such as Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law often made speeches, no leaders have emerged in recent days. Tai and Chan are  in jail for conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and inciting others to cause a public nuisance. Wong, Law and Chow were sentenced to between six and eight months in jail on charges of “unlawful assembly” for staging a demonstration, although they later won an appeal.The NGO worker Isaac Tsang said the spate of arrests and jailings for involvement in the 2014 movement had made young people more protective of themselves. But at the same time, knowing that the government often ignored peaceful expressions, the youngsters increasingly believed they had no choice but to resort to radical actions.“This is a vicious circle,” he warned. “More violent confrontations may happen and at this rate, it is a matter of time before the police use real bullets.”",Hong Kong activists warn of violence if protests are

"Pro-democracy activists and lawmakers in Hong Kong have accused the police of standing by as men dressed in white attacked commuters and protesters, leaving 45 people hospitalised, including one who is critically injured.Video footage showed dozens of men, mostly in masks, storming a mass transit station in Yuen Long late on Sunday, chasing passengers and beating them with sticks. Among those hurt in the attack were demonstrators returning from a large anti-government rally, as well as a pregnant woman and a woman holding a child, according to witnesses.The footage, which emerged after an anti-government march by hundreds of thousands of people, caused widespread anger and condemnation as protesters and critics accused pro-Beijing officials of hiring thugs to intimidate protesters – a charge that Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam vehemently denied in a briefing Monday afternoon.“Is Hong Kong now allowing triads to do what they want, beating up people on the street with weapons?” the Democratic party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, who was among the injured, asked reporters.A former legislator previously with a pro-Beijing party that usually supports Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, also criticised her over the attack. James Tien on Facebook called on Lam to resign, writing: “Chief executive Lam, are you still a chief executive? Or are triads ruling Hong Kong now?”The pro-democracy lawmaker Ray Chan tweeted: “Hong Kong has one of the world’s highest cop to population ratio. Where were @hkpoliceforce?” Another lawmaker Gary Fan said: “Hong Kong is no longer a safe city”.Flanked by Hong Kong’s police commissioner, security chief and government ministers on Monday, Lam attempted to deflect blame by condemning both sides. “Violence will only breed more violence and at the end of the day the whole of Hong Kong and the people will suffer,” she said.Details of the attack shocked residents. A woman sobbed while recounting what happened during the Yuen Long attack, telling one witness in audio circulated online: “They beat people in the carriage indiscriminately whoever they were, even people who were returning home from work … Some men were shielding us. They didn’t fight back otherwise we would have been beaten even worse. They beat even women and children.”Video filmed inside the train showed passengers screaming and crying as they attempted to shield themselves with umbrellas. The attackers used metal and wooden rods, as well as canes and brooms.Footage showed a young man dressed in black being punched and kneed in the stomach by several men. A female journalist was beaten while filming the attack. Photos showed commuters bleeding and smears of blood on the station ground.When police arrived at the station after 11pm, the assailants had left and angry protesters demanded to know why they had taken so long to get there. Police left and the attackers later came back a second time, breaking into a closed gate of the train station.Hong Kong’s hospital authority said 45 people between the ages of 18 and 64 were injured in the attack, including one man who was in a critical condition and three in a serious condition. Late on Monday, police said they had arrested five people – some of them allegedly Triads – in relation to the attacks on charges of “unlawful assembly”.Snippet of a live broadcast from lawmaker Lam Cheuk ting, showing self-professed pro-Gov't mobsters attacking passengers in train cars at #MTR #YuenLong Stn. #HongKong has 1 of the world's highest cop to population ratio. Where were @hkpoliceforce? Lam was injured as shown live. pic.twitter.com/Aq5JmJlf5uOn Monday, Yoho Mall, a shopping centre connected to the Yuen Long mass transit station, said some shops had closed amid rumours the armed men would return in the evening. Businesses outside the station in Yuen Long were also closed on Monday afternoon, leaving the normally colourful streets eerily quiet. Local public recreation centres were closed at 7pm due to “public safety considerations,” according to Hong Kong’s leisure and cultural services department. Many shops in the normally bustling shopping centres in the towns of Shatin and Tuen Mun have also closed.Hiring men to beat up protesters is not a new tactic, according to activists and observers, who say thugs were also behind attacks on pro-democracy protests in 2014. Men, possibly from southern China, where the practice is more common, heckled and assaulted demonstrators.A widely circulated video showed the pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho, who lives in Yuen Long, shaking hands with men in white and giving them a thumbs up. In response to accusations that he had hired the men to go after protesters, Ho said in a press briefing on Monday that he had nothing to do with the attack. Asked why he did not call the police, Ho said: “They appeared to be normal residents, just like the protesters in your eyes.”Protesters later covered Ho’s office in pro-democracy sticky notes and threw documents of his over an escalator. Several who covered their faces with scarves and hats later broke down a glass wall of his office in a shopping mall in Tsuen Wan. One poster on the wall stuck on by protesters said: “Rural bullies beat up people and carry out terrorist attacks!”In the early hours of Monday, morning police entered a village near the station in Yuen Long where groups of men in white had gathered but said they had seen no weapons and made no arrests because they “could not be sure of who was involved”.On Monday, Lam and her colleagues were pressed on why police took so long to reach the attacks, even after several people had called emergency services. The police chief, Stephen Lo, said officers, at the time facing down protesters who had amassed near Beijing’s liaison office, had to be redeployed.Lam was criticised after lambasting protesters for their “blatant challenge to national sovereignty” before condemning the Yuen Long attack in statements issued late on Sunday after protesters clashed with police. Asked if she would characterise the attack in Yuen Long as a terrorist attack, Lam said only that she condemned all kinds of violence.The protests, which began over a bill that would allow suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China, have take on wider demands, including an investigation into police behaviour. The violence in Yuen Long and the police’s response is likely to be the focus of another protest.On Sunday, thousands of protesters attending a peaceful anti-government march defied the police-sanctioned route and pushed westwards to Beijing’s representative office in Hong Kong, where they graffitied the building’s walls, threw eggs at it, and defaced the emblem of the People’s Republic of China.Speaking outside the building on Monday, Wang Zhimin, the director of Beijing’s liaison office, said an “illegal mob” had “seriously hurt the feelings of the entire Chinese people”. Chinese state media called the attack a “blatant challenge to the central government”.The demonstrations challenge Beijing’s authority over the former British colony, returned to Chinese control in 1997. Under the one country, two systems framework, Hong Kong is meant to maintain a high degree of autonomy from the mainland, with an independent judiciary and a free press. But critics say they have witnessed Hong Kong’s freedoms quickly disappearing.Among protesters’ demands are democratic reforms that would give Hong Kongers the ability to directly elect their leaders. Protest groups have vowed to continue until their demands are met. “I don’t see this ending. It looks like it’s just going to escalate … it’s almost becoming ungovernable,” said Victoria Hui, a political scientist from Hong Kong, now at Notre Dame University.",'Where were the police?'

"Demonstrators in Hong Kong have vowed to march despite a police ban to condemn an attack by suspected gangs on commuters earlier this week.On Thursday, police rejected an application by protesters to hold a rally in Yuen Long, in north-west Hong Kong, where dozens of masked men beat commuters on Sunday with rattan and iron rods.“The march must go on,” said Michael Mo, a co-signer of the application submitted to police, on behalf of a group of protesters. Previously, Max Chung, who met police to submit the forms, also said he would move ahead if denied. “For me personally I will, 100%,” he said on Tuesday.The ban raises the likelihood of clashes with local villagers, who had reportedly asked police to reject the application. Observers worry that an unsanctioned rally will embolden attackers from Sunday, believed to belong to organised crime groups, known as the triads. Yuen Long is surrounded by villages where these groups are active.“We have enough reasons to believe the protesters may have violent conflicts with the residents of the villages, which is dangerous for both sides,” the police said in a letter of objection given to Chung.“Based on the conflicts in previous protests and the recent atmosphere in society, the police have enough reason to believe you cannot control the behaviour of the protesters. This is not good for maintaining public security or protecting others’ rights and freedom,” it said.Online protesters wrote under news of the rejection that they would travel to Yuen Long on Saturday, the date of the planned rally, to buy traditional Cantonese pastries or “take a stroll”. The police letter means that the march is in effect illegal and anyone found demonstrating could be arrested.“Since we can’t protest, we in Yuen Long invite people to come and visit,” one user wrote on a forum for protesters. Others called on Hong Kongers to head to Yuen Long to “boost the economy” and by walking what would have been the route for the march, along a main road in the town’s commercial district.“I myself on the same time and the same day will walk from the start point to end point by myself. I’m just telling everyone in Hong Kong my daily schedule,” Chung said after receiving news of the ban. He has applied to appeal the decision.Meanwhile, Hong Kong authorities came under intense pressure to investigate and sanction those connected to the Yuen Long attack, which has prompted accusations of collusion between security, local authorities and the triads.The Civil Human Rights Front and the Labour party filed formal complaints with Hong Kong’s anti-graft agency, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, accusing police commissioner and other top police officials of misconduct.On Wednesday, the democratic lawmaker Andrew Wan, from the New Territories, and his party also lodged a complaint, accusing the police of knowing of the attack beforehand but doing nothing to prevent it. A district councillor from Yuen Long has said he alerted police to threats of an attack that day and was told the police had “a plan”.Calls for a government response have mushroomed over the past week, with rallies planned at Hong Kong airport and in a major hospital, as well as in Yuen Long. More than 23 groups, including civil servants, legislative staff, hospital workers, kindergarten teachers and pilots, have published statements condemning the attack and urging the government to respond.The attack has escalated public anger at Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, whose resignation is one of the protesters’ key demands. Previous criticism was focused on her refusal to meet demands by demonstrators including a full withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill that started the protests.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongNow, the ability of Lam’s administration to govern has come into question. “The people of Hong Kong are already on the verge of collapse … the police no longer protect the public [and] the Hong Kong government is incapable of governance,” said a letter signed by more than 100 civil servants from 23 departments that issued “severe condemnation” of authorities.Lam, who was last seen in public on Monday when she gave widely criticised comments to the press, said police would investigate the incident. The police have arrested 12 people in connection with the attack, on suspicion of “unlawful assembly”. No charges have yet been made.“The government is under a lot, a lot of pressure,” said Joseph Cheng, a retired political scientist based in Hong Kong. “People are wondering if the administration can even be effective in maintaining law and order.”",Hong Kong protesters to defy police ban on march after gang attack,2019-07-25/10:44:42,demonstrators in hong kong have vowed to march despite a police

"China has offered its full support to Hong Kong’s embattled leader and its police force, and said violent protesters must be swiftly punished, in rare remarks by the government office that oversees policy towards the territory.Hong Kong has been rocked by two months of escalating pro-democracy protests that have posed the most significant challenge to Beijing’s authority since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.In its first press conference since 1997, the state council’s Hong Kong and Macau affairs office said the protests were “horrendous incidents” that have caused serious damage to the rule of law.“No civilised society or rule of law society will tolerate rampant violence,” said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the office. Yang said the violence, which he blamed on a “few radicals”, had seriously undermined Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability.“In our view, the most dangerous situation in Hong Kong is that violent crimes have not been effectively stopped,” he added. “The most important task of Hong Kong at present is to resolutely punish violent crimes according to law, restore social stability as soon as possible, and safeguard Hong Kong’s good legal system.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office.

China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongThe last eight weeks of protests were sparked by a now delayed bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China, but most recently the anger has pivoted towards the police, who have been accused of using excessive force.Protesters have also focused their ire on what many believe to be collusion between the authorities and triads, Hong Kong’s organised crime groups, after masked and armed thugs conducted vicious attacks on metro commuters, protesters and journalists on 21 July.At the press conference on Monday the Hong Kong office said “rumours” of police or Chinese involvement in the attacks were “unfounded and insulting”.Echoing statements previously made by state-owned media and other Beijing officials, the spokesman also sharply criticised foreign “interference”, blaming western politicians for trying to cause trouble in the country.Hours before the briefing on Monday, the People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist party, called on the Hong Kong government and police to “not hesitate” and “do what needs to be done” to end the weeks of protest.“For some time, the power of the Hong Kong police has been severely limited by politics, public opinion, and even the judicial environment,” said one editorial, describing protesters as “thugs” and “militants” who have undermined stability in Hong Kong.“Facing these circumstances the Hong Kong government and police should not have any hesitation or any ‘psychological burden’ – do what needs to be done.” The article called on the police to “punish lawbreakers regardless of whether they hold up the banner of ‘freedom and democracy’ or wear the cap of ‘civil disobedience’”.Monday’s remarks by government officials and the party paper are the strongest statements Beijing has made since the mass protests began in June. Observers have been looking for clues as to how Beijing would respond and the possibility of escalation, including deploying the People’s Liberation Army, which has a garrison in Hong Kong.At the briefing, the spokesperson sidestepped a question on potential intervention, saying he had nothing to add to what was already stated in the Basic Law, the city’s constitution. Last week, an official from the Chinese defence ministry said Beijing could legally intervene should the Hong Kong government ask for help “in maintaining social order”.In a front-page article in the overseas edition of the People’s Daily on Monday, the paper also criticised the Civil Human Rights Front, a group in Hong Kong that has organised mass marches against the extradition bill. The paper accused the group of collaborating with “western forces” and warned citizens to keep their eyes open to such groups who “lead the wolves into your home and hurt the country”.“[China] will never allow any foreign forces to collaborate with the internal forces, endanger Hong Kong’s development, and trample on ‘one country, two systems’,” the article said.With anger mounting over police violence, including the use of teargas in residential areas over the weekend, there is no end in sight to the mass demonstrations. Protests are scheduled for the next three weeks all over the territory, including a mass transit strike, a rally by civil servants and a city-wide strike.“For the Chinese Communist party, the continuing crisis in Hong Kong is not only a direct challenge to its authority but also damaging to its domestic prestige and international reputation,” said Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Australia.“Essentially, Beijing just doesn’t have any simple short-term answers to the current impasse,” he said. “Beijing’s Hong Kong problem is here to stay.”",China calls for Hong

"Chen Siming, a 58-year-old Chinese activist, has followed the protests in Hong Kong from afar, feeling inspired but also helpless.From across the border in the southern province of Hunan, Chen does what he can to support the thousands calling for greater democracy in Hong Kong. In late August, he and more than 20 others posted online selfies of themselves covering their right eye, a gesture of solidarity for a young Hong Kong woman who says she was badly injured during a clash between police and protesters.Last week, Chen was summoned “for a chat” with the police – the sixth time he has been questioned by police, who also interrogated more than 20 others who posted the self portraits. The police threatened Chen with imprisonment and suggested his son could be badly affected. The police call him every day to check his whereabouts.“They play hard and soft at the same time. Sometimes they say good things and sometimes they threaten you. They try all kinds of ways,” he said.But Chen has not been dissuaded. He regularly “jumps” China’s great firewall to access foreign news sites and posts links in a Wechat group of more than 200 people. Every few days censors shut down the group, but he and his friends keep reopening it. The group is now on its 20th iteration.“I feel deeply ashamed that we can’t do anything. Morally speaking, if you don’t condemn a crime, you are complicit in it,” he added.Chen is one of dozens of Chinese intellectuals, activists, and regular people in the mainland who support the protests in Hong Kong but have had their voices muffled by Chinese authorities. On the mainland officials have been quick to censor Hong Kong-related news that has not been sanctioned and detain the few activists who have travelled to to the special administrative region.In the lead up to China’s 1 October National Day, when the country celebrates 70 years of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, authorities are more sensitive than usual. Chen and other Chinese activists have been ordered not to travel to Hong Kong until after 10 October.Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a rights advocacy group, has documented more than 20 cases of mainland Chinese being threatened or detained for posting messages of support, traveling to Hong Kong, or just retweeting news stories about the protests.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said her government will formally withdraw the bill that ignited months of protests. Hong Kong residents had feared it could be used by China to extradite people for political reasons. They want guarantees that it cannot be reintroduced at a later date.Protesters want the government to officially recognise that their movement has been a series of legitimate protests, rather than a riot, as has been stated in official communications.Hundreds of people have been arrested in recent weeks, and the protesters are demanding that all of them be freed, and that no convictions should stand against any of them.Police use of force has escalated since the demonstrations began, while protesters have also resorted to increasingly violent measures. Demonstrators say an inquiry into police brutality is the number-one priority.Hong Kong's chief executive is currently selected by a 1,200-member committee, and nearly half of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by limited electorates representing different sectors of the economy. The protesters want to be able to vote for their leaders in free and open democratic elections. “The government’s battle for Hong Kong is also being fought in mainland cities,” wrote Frances Eve, deputy director of research. “The Chinese government is working overtime to threaten and detain mainlanders from sharing and commenting on the protests in Hong Kong for fear of what it may spark back home”.Chen Quishi, a Beijing-based lawyer who traveled to Hong Kong in mid-August, saw his Weibo account shut down a few days after he published three videos of anti-government protests that were then reposted by others on Youtube. He was called back to Beijing and on Tuesday said he had to report to “leaders” what he was doing in Hong Kong and how his videos were reposted.“I can understand. It is almost the national anniversary, so it is quite sensitive,” Chen Qiushi said.Wei Xiaobing, an activist in Zhejiang province, was held for 15 days in June after he shared a Facebook post and a tweet that said: “keep it up Hong Kong!”China’s propaganda machine has been in overdrive over the last two months, depicting the protesters as rioters seeking to overthrow the government, but activists say many people see through it.“Actually a lot of young people on the mainland support Hong Kong but because of the suppression, the constant monitoring, they dare not speak out loudly,” said Lu, a 25-year old resident of Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, who began going to the protests in June out of curiosity.Lu said he was shocked by scope and size of the protests and on 7 July, when demonstrators marched to a Kowloon rail station linking China and Hong Kong, he decided to join.After nervously crossing the border into Hong Kong that morning with a pair of clothes to change into, a pen and paper, he locked himself in a bathroom at a KFC. Trembling, he wrote the words on a sign that he held up that day: “I’m from mainland China, I am thankful to Hong Kong people! Don’t give up, fight for freedom!’A little more than a month later after Lu attended several more protests, he was detained for 10 days in Shenzhen. He has now fled to Thailand and is debating what to do next.“I really feel guilty and shameful. The price of this struggle should have been borne by us. Now Hong Kong people are bleeding for us and even losing their lives,” he wrote in an essay on Medium.“It is our indifference, indulgence and indifference that has lead to more and more arrogance of this dictatorship until it endangers everyone,” Lu added.The police have also ordered Chen to delete his account or his posts on Twitter, where he is also active, but he refused.Chen believes more regular Chinese citizens would support the protests if they had the right information. “Many people don’t know what is going on at all,” he said.“Like our compatriots in Hong Kong, we can’t go back. We must stand out. To support the people of Hong Kong is to support ourselves,” he said.",'We can't do anything': China accused of muffling voices of Hong Kong supporters,2019-09-11/02:09:53,chen siming a  year old

"China has issued its most pointed threat yet to pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, warning that it has “enough solutions and enough power to swiftly quell unrest” should it deem the situation “uncontrollable”.Speaking to international media in London on Thursday, China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, also accused some British politicians of harbouring a “colonial mindset” in their interventions.On Wednesday satellite images showed hundreds of armoured paramilitary police vehicles parked in a stadium in the southern Chinese city of Shenzen, close to the Hong Kong border.Demonstrations in Hong Kong that began 10 weeks ago in opposition to a proposal to allow extraditions to China have widened into more comprehensive anti-government protests.The ambassador accused “extremists” of posing as as pro-democracy activists and said Beijing was not prepared “to sit on its hands and watch”.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong“We hope this will end in an orderly way. In the meantime we are fully prepared for the worst,” he said, warning that the protesters risked dragging the territory into a “dangerous abyss”.Liu rejected a tweet from Donald Trump calling on Beijing to treat Hong Kong “humanely” in order to reach a trade deal, insisting that China would not “barter” over the territory.Declining to speculate on what might trigger a Chinese intervention, the ambassador reiterated Beijing’s warnings that it regarded recent incidents of “radical street protest” – including clashes during an occupation of Hong Kong’s airport – as showing signs of “terrorism”.Liu’s swipe at UK politicians followed a proposal by the foreign affairs select committee chairman, Tom Tugendhat, to extend UK citizenship rights to Hong Kong Chinese. China took over the former British colony in 1997 under the framework of “one country, two systems”, which protesters fear is being eroded. Recently Beijing told the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to stop interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs.“Politicians in this country know their body is in the 21st century but their heads are still in the colonial days,” Liu said. “They are going to have to change their mindset, put them in the proper position and regard Hong Kong as a part of China, not as a part of the UK.”Referring to the 300,000 UK citizens and thousands of UK businesses in Hong Kong, Liu added: “I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life in the UK will have a clear understanding of a big picture, act in the interests of Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, and refrain from saying or doing anything that interferes in Hong Kong’s affairs or undermines the rule of law in Hong Kong.”1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. On Thursday Hong Kong’s government unveiled $2.44bn (£2bn) worth of economic relief measures and downgraded its growth forecasts.Although framed as a mini-budget amid economic uncertainty, some analysts saw the move as a sweetener aimed at winning over support from moderate Hongkongers.Police made five arrests on Tuesday night and 17 more on Wednesday during clashes outside police stations in the Sham Shui Po district as flights were suspended by mass demonstrations in Hong Kong airport.China initially censored all news of the protests but in recent days has taken to denigrating the protesters as criminals being manipulated by the US, Taiwan and other unnamed foreign powers.The ambassador accused foreign officials of fomenting unrest by meeting protest leaders, suggesting the involvement of “dark hands”.The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984 paved the way for Hong Kong’s handover back to China and said the city would enjoy a “high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs” and be “vested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power”.The US national security advisor, John Bolton, warned China against creating a “new” Tiananmen Square in its response to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in comments published on Thursday.“The Chinese have to look very carefully at the steps they take because people in America remember Tiananmen Square, they remember the picture of the man standing in front of the line of tanks,” Bolton said in an interview with VOA News.",Hong Kong protests: envoy says China has 'power to quell unrest',2019-08-15/15:17:30,china has issued its most pointed threat

"As Hong Kong enters its third month of mass anti-government protests, across the border in China, people are seeing a very different version of events.On Saturday, as protests entered their tenth weekend and demonstrators and police clashed in Hong Kong, the People’s Daily posted an article on the Chinese WeChat webchat service saying members from “all parts of Hong Kong society” were calling for the “violence to stop”. As peaceful rallies at the Hong Kong airport continued over the weekend, Chinese state media posted videos on Weibo of a tussle between demonstrators and an angry resident yelling: “We just want Hong Kong to be safe”.Other special reports include letters between the Chinese and Hong Kong police applauding “the great bravery” of the Hong Kong police – a main target of the protests. Last week, a journalist with state news agency Xinhua travelled to Hong Kong and described the city as “shrouded in black terror”.Over the past two months, Chinese state media outlets have gone from near silence on the protests and blanket censorship of footage of the demonstrations to actively pushing news, editorials, videos and online discussions.“On the topic of Hong Kong, the mainland media can’t be seen as journalism. It’s purely propaganda… It is intercepting a small part of the information, distorting it and magnifying it,” said Fang Kecheng, a professor at Chinese University of Hong Kong, specialising in communications.In Chinese state media the demonstrations, most of which have been peaceful, are routinely described as “riots”. Daily coverage show footage of protesters hurling bricks, jeering at police, and surrounding police stations. The protesters are described as “radicals” and “thugs” seeking to topple the entire system through independence for the city, a former British colony now under Chinese sovereignty.Few protesters have been pushing for independence – their demands have included the permanent withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill and an independent investigation into police behaviour.Taking a page from the protesters’ book, the People’s Daily published a range of posters, one featuring muscular riot police facing off against brick-throwing rioters. “It’s hard to say whether it is right or not to hit them,” the posters declare. “I only hate that they are also Chinese people.”Protesters are also portrayed as “lured by the evil winds” of foreign agents. Chinese officials have accused the US and other western countries of being the “black hand” behind the protests – a narrative that pro-government figures and media in Hong Kong have also seized on.Observers see the shift as a way to prepare the public for more drastic action Beijing or the Hong Kong government may take toward the protesters as well as a chance to push China’s view of events.“The propaganda authorities perhaps realised this could be an opportunity,” said Fang. “There is not much to say when the marches are peaceful. But now with these violent incidents, the authorities can exaggerate them and stir Chinese people’s emotions. They can play into nationalist sentiment.” That appears to be working. A discussion topic on Weibo hosted by the People’s Daily – titled “Protect Hong Kong, firmly say no to violence” – has more than 1 million comments, most in support and some calling for more extreme measures. A “protect the national flag” campaign on Weibo has been trending, after protesters in Hong Kong twice threw the Chinese flag into the sea.Many mainland Chinese believe foreign agents are indeed behind the protests, a claim protesters and observers see as laughable.“At the end of the day, Hong Kong is still part of China. What they are doing is pointless. The foreign countries pushed and they just followed,” said a student studying overseas in Seoul who asked not to be named.“I don’t know their motivation is,” he admitted. “The news we receive is biased and only from one perspective.”Few Chinese residents are clear on why the protests began in the first place. “I don’t know the details,” said Guo, 20, who lives in Beijing. “But I think we should be united and together and we should be patriotic. Only a united country can continue to develop stronger.”Others also pointed to a lack of patriotism as the problem. “Maybe it’s the education system. If they were educated to be patriotic from an early age, it wouldn’t be the way it is now,” said Liu, 18, a recent high school graduate from Shandong province.Observers say Chinese state media have purposefully obscured why the protesters have been demonstrating for the last two months, focusing instead on violent clashes between the protesters and police. Chinese state media have described armed men who have attacked commuters and protesters as “patriots”.“Left out is reporting on and images of police violence, of which there has been a good deal and the attacks on unarmed protesters by armed thugs,” said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a historian of modern China at the University of California, Irvine.“The implication is that what protesters have been doing is creating ‘chaos’ or luan, a very freighted word in the People’s Republic of China,” he said, referring to the term’s usage to describe the upheavals of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s as well as to criticise protests in Tiananmen Square that were violently put down on 4 June 1989.“This echo is worrying, even if it is always too simplistic to look for history repeating itself step by step in a different context,” he said.Not everyone subscribes to the official media’s version of events. Images have circulated online of ID cards posted by Chinese netizens in support of the protesters.A blogger on Weibo, who asked to identify herself only as Z, has been trying to share articles she believes show the real nature of what is happening in Hong Kong. Her posts are often deleted or blocked on Wechat or Weibo. An article she and her friends tried to circulate, with a timeline of events in Hong Kong and answers to questions about the protests, was blocked after receiving more than 100,000 views.“The main reason why Hong Kong people are against the extradition bill is distrust of the mainland judicial system, so how could they let the 1.4 billion people of China see that?”“I think all the actions that Hong Kong people took are reasonable and understandable. I feel sad and heartbroken,” she said.She added: “As a citizen, it is common to protest against what you think is unreasonable. It’s just that this is not common here on the mainland.”",Beijing’s new weapon to muffle Hong Kong protests: fake news,2019-08-11/10:00:46,as hong kong enters its third month of mass anti government

"Thousands of people swept into the streets of Hong Kong for a night of protests marked by violence after the government activated sweeping colonial-era powers for the first time in over half a century, using them to ban face masks.The chief executive, Carrie Lam, also said harsher measures could be on the table if the protest movement continued, amid calls from police groups and pro-Beijing politicians for a citywide curfew, and discussion of delays to local elections set for November.The government appeared braced for more clashes between police and protesters before Lam’s announcement that she had invoked the emergency regulations ordinance and passed a law forbidding the use of face masks.Government employees were sent home early, all after-school activities were cancelled, and many shopping malls, banks and businesses shuttered.Shortly after she finished a two-hour press conference, the first groups of protesters were filtering on to the streets of Hong Kong island.After darkness fell, crowds set fire to two metro stations and vandalised shops and businesses considered pro-China; police responded with teargas, and in at least one case live ammunition.There were reports that a student had been hit in the thigh by a bullet, after a group of protesters attacked an off-duty police officer. Hospital authorities said they had received a 14-year-old boy, who was in a serious condition.At the press conference to announce the new anti-mask law, Lam said that if violence was not halted the government would not rule out any measures permitted by law. “Freedoms are not without limits,” she told journalists.The emergency regulations ordinance, created by British authorities to break up port strikes in 1922, had not been used for more than half a century, and never since the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997.It gives Lam virtually unlimited powers, although legal scholars said the government could be challenged in court if anything it did violated the Basic Law, the territory’s constitution.“We have the duty to use all available means to stop the escalating violence and restore calmness in society,” Lam said in a combative press conference unveiling the new law. “The decision to invoke the emergency regulations ordinance is a difficult, but also a necessary one for public interest.”Masks have become common among protesters who fear either arrest now, or retaliation from Hong Kong and Chinese authorities in the longer term if they are identified. But the ban seemed unlikely to deter crowds who have already defied multiple government bans to turn out on illegal marches and demonstrations.Activists and rights groups warned the mask ban might pave the way for fiercer controls on public life, once the government had tested public and legal response to using the emergency ordinance.Asked whether she would consider other measures proposed by pro-Beijing politicians, including a curfew or a delay to upcoming local elections, Lam said everything was on the table.“If the violence escalates, as a responsible government, we must make use of existing legal provisions,” she said. “We would not rule out any measures that we can reasonably implement under the current law.”Later she added: “Freedoms are not without limits, OK, so there are things which one has to strike a balance, dealing with a particular situation.”Protesters, rights groups and academics denounced the use of emergency powers as a gross abuse of power, and a dangerous precedent for a city that for the last 20 years has enjoyed an unusual combination of civic freedoms without full democratic rule.“Today, she declared that the authoritarian government can take away your freedoms any time,” said Prof Ma Ngok, political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He added that the new law would likely prove impossible to enforce and counterproductive, provoking “an even larger and more violent resistance”.The regulation came into effect at midnight on Friday and bars all face coverings, including paint, at any public gathering, on pain of a fine and a year in jail.In the testy press conference, one journalist put on his gas mask and protective goggles and shouted at Lam: “Would I be arrested if I am dressed like this while working?” Officials said there would be exemptions for anyone who covered their face for health, religious or professional reasons.A new Hong Kong extradition law is proposed, which would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for a variety of crimes. Residents fear it could lead to politically motivated extraditions into China's much harsher judicial system.Large public demonstrations start as thousands march in the streets to protest against the extradition bill.Hong Kong lawmakers scuffle in parliament during a row over the law.Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences, but critics say they are not enough.The scale of protests continues to increase as more than half a million people take to the streets. Police use rubber bullets and teargas against the biggest protests Hong Kong has seen for decades.Lam says the proposed extradition law has been postponed indefinitely.The protests continue as demonstrators storm the Legislative Council, destroying pictures, daubing graffiti on the walls and flying the old flag of Hong Kong emblazoned with the British union flag. The protests coincide with the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the UK back to China.Armed men in white T-shirts thought to be supporting the Chinese government attack passengers and passers-by in Yuen Long metro station, while nearby police take no action.44 protesters are charged with rioting, which further antagonises the anti-extradition bill movement.By now the protest movement has coalesced around five key demands: complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, withdrawal of the use of the word ""riot"" in relation to the protests, unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped, an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of genuine universal suffrage.The mass protests enter their fifteenth week, with police resorting to teargas and water cannon against the demonstrators, and a wave of ""doxxing"" using digital techniques to unmask police and protesters as a new front in the battle.Police shoot a protester with live ammunition for the first time, as demonstrations continue on the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People's Republic of China.The first charges are brought against protesters for covering their faces, after authorities bring in new laws banning face masks in order to make it easier to identify or detain protesters.Hong Kong officials spark outrage in the city as it revealed that nearly a third of protesters arrested since June have been children.

The extradition bill is also formally withdrawn, a key demand of protesters.Despite the sense of crisis, and the deployment of emergency powers, Lam insisted that the city was not in a state of emergency. The ordinance also covered situations where there was a “danger to public order”, she said.The city was wracked by the worst violence of the four-month-old protest movement on Tuesday, as crowds fought pitched battles with police across the city and an officer shot a teenage student in the chest.The government’s response to that chaos and and an outpouring of grief and anger over the injured student, suggested a worrying lack of flexibility in tackling the city’s crisis, said Jean-Philippe Béja, research emeritus professor at the centre for international studies and research at Sciences Po in Paris.“The only thing that they have come up with is using a police response to solve political problems,” he said. “This is a further restriction on HK’s freedoms, but the way it is implemented is more worrying than the law itself because it’s completely arbitrary.”• Additional reporting by Verna Yu",Violence grips Hong Kong as Lam activates emergency powers,2019-10-04/18:04:50,thousands of people swept into the streets of hong kong for a night of protests marked by violence after the government activated sweeping colonial era powers for the first time in over half a century using them to ban face masks the chief executive carrie lam also said harsher measures could be on the table if the protest movement continued amid calls from police groups and pro beijing politicians for a citywide curfew and discussion of delays to local elections set for november the government appeared braced for more clashes between police and protesters before lam s announcement that she had invoked the emergency regulations ordinance and passed a law forbidding the use of face masks government employees were sent home early all after school activities were cancelled and many shopping malls banks and businesses shuttered shortly after she finished a two hour press conference the first groups of protesters were filtering on to the streets of hong kong island after darkness fell crowds set fire to two metro stations and vandalised shops and businesses considered pro china police responded with teargas and in at least one case live ammunition there were reports that a student had been hit in the thigh by a bullet after a group of protesters attacked an off duty police officer hospital authorities said they had received a  year old boy who was in a serious condition at the press conference to announce the new anti mask law lam said that if violence was not halted the government would not rule out any measures permitted by law freedoms are not without limits she told journalists the emergency regulations ordinance created by british authorities to break up port strikes in  had not been used for more than half a century and never since the handover of hong kong to chinese rule in  it gives lam virtually unlimited powers although legal scholars said the government could be challenged in court if anything it did violated the basic law the territory s constitution we have the duty to use all available means to stop the escalating violence and restore calmness in society lam said in a combative press conference unveiling the new law the decision to invoke the emergency regulations ordinance is a difficult but also a necessary one for public interest masks have become common among protesters who fear either arrest now or retaliation from hong kong and chinese authorities in the longer term if they are identified but the ban seemed unlikely to deter crowds who have already defied multiple government bans to turn out on illegal marches and demonstrations activists and rights groups warned the mask ban might pave the way for fiercer controls on public life once the government had tested public and legal response to using the emergency ordinance asked whether she would consider other measures proposed by pro beijing politicians including a curfew or a delay to upcoming local elections lam said everything was on the table if the violence escalates as a responsible government we must make use of existing legal provisions she said we would not rule out any measures that we can reasonably implement under the current law later she added freedoms are not without limits ok so there are things which one has to strike a balance dealing with a particular situation protesters rights groups and academics denounced the use of emergency powers as a gross abuse of power and a dangerous precedent for a city that for the last  years has enjoyed an unusual combination of civic freedoms without full democratic rule today she

"BEIJING/SHANGHAI   - Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise were pulled from several Nike (NKE.N) stores in major Chinese cities amid the furor surrounding a tweet from the team’s general manager in support of anti-government protests in Hong Kong.  Managers at five Nike stores in Beijing and Shanghai told Reuters during visits on Thursday they had been told in recent days via a memo from management that all Rockets merchandise had to be removed. Reuters was unable to view the memo.  Although Rockets general manager Daryl Morey has since apologized for his tweet last week, National Basketball Association (NBA) Commissioner Adam Silver further angered authorities when he said the league backed Morey’s right to exercise his freedom of expression.  Despite the controversy, the NBA was pressing ahead with an exhibition game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai on Thursday night. Promotional events earlier in the week had been canceled. The stakes are high for NBA, whose league business in China is said to be worth more than $4 billion. The world’s most populous nation is Nike’s top source of revenue growth as other regions slow. Three Nike stores in Shenzhen also kept Rockets merchandise off the shelves, as well as NBA products in general, staff told Reuters by phone. Three Nike stores in Chengdu, a bustling inland city in southwest China, also removed Rockets products.  Nike and its China office did not respond to multiple Reuters requests for comment.  A specialist NBA store at Super Brand Mall, a major shopping center in the Shanghai financial district of Lujiazui, has also removed all Rockets-related merchandise. “Other stuff, there hasn’t been any impact, and no one has said we need to withdraw it,” said a store manager, laughing. “If they say that all NBA stuff has to be withdrawn then our store will go bankrupt.”   At two basketball-themed NBA Playzone family entertainment centers in Shanghai and Beijing opened by NBA China, staff confirmed that Rockets products had been removed. “Rockets products were hot before and when you stepped into the store, it was full of red. Now, it is mostly yellow and blue,” the colors of the Golden State Warriors, said a manager at the Shanghai Playzone, who like the NBA store employee declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. NBA China did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about the entertainment centers.  Major Chinese e-commerce platforms Alibaba (BABA.N) and JD.com (JD.O) have taken Houston Rockets merchandise off their sales platforms, including mobile apps. Searches for sneakers with the NBA logo on Alibaba and JD.com also yielded no results. Those include collaboration sneakers marketed with brands such as Nike and Carlyle-backed (CG.O) Supreme. A handful of individual online merchants still sell the sneakers.  Alibaba, which declined to comment, told domestic media that Morey’s comments had seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, and that there was no room for negotiation.  JD.com, which also did not comment, told local media that the firm deeply resented and strongly condemned Morey’s remarks. Two of the largest online resale marketplaces for sneakers in China have also removed all branded shoes connected to the NBA, according to four sneaker traders.  Poizon and DoNew, two mobile shopping apps popular among fans of designer sneakers, have taken NBA shoes off their platforms, traders said. A Reuters search on Poizon and DoNew’s apps with the keyword “NBA” returned no results.  Poizon did not respond to an emailed request for comment and phone calls to DoNew’s office in Shanghai went unanswered.  “As long as the bosses of Nike and Adidas don’t come out and say something stupid and get banned by China’s central government, I think sneaker resales in China will remain pretty profitable,” said Zhu Junwen, a reseller in Guangzhou.  Adidas (ADSGn.DE) is in the middle of a reported $200 million, 13-year endorsement contract with Houston Rockets star guard James Harden, who is the centrepiece of the apparel maker’s basketball shoe lineup.   “But if (Nike and Adidas get banned), that would be the end of it,” Zhu said.

"Hong Kong’s leader plans to use harsh colonial-era emergency powers for the first time, banning face masks in a bid to curb the city’s protests.Opposition politicians warned it represented a slide towards authoritarianism and risked further inflaming tensions.Adding to concerns about a hardline government approach, a leaked memo showed police had relaxed their guidelines on using lethal force the day before a teenage student was shot in the chest, the first live-ammunition injury since protests began in June.Police have insisted the officer acted lawfully, and the 18-year-old student, who is still being treated in hospital, was charged with rioting and assaulting a police officer.Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, was expected to announce details of the face mask ban on Friday, local media reported, in response to chaotic violence across the city on China’s national day, 1 October.Lam was at a gala in Beijing celebrating 70 years of communist rule while pitched battles were fought in the streets of her city between police and protesters, but since her return she has been under heavy pressure from pro-China groups to use the sweeping powers bequeathed by the British.The emergency regulations ordinance was introduced in 1922 so colonial authorities could break up strikes paralysing the ports. It allows the government to make any regulations it considers in the public interest, if it decides the city faces “an occasion of emergency or public danger”.Measures imposed could include censorship, control or suppression of the media, arrests, detentions, deportations, and seizure of property. The legislature can only amend or repeal any law passed under the emergency regulations once it has already been implemented.The regulations are considered so extreme that they have not been used for over half a century, and never deployed since the 1997 handover to Chinese sovereignty.“The emergency regulations are the start of a slip towards an authoritarian state,” a lawmaker, Dennis Kwok, said at a news conference, adding that he did not expect any form of government crackdown to end the protest movement.“The yearning for freedom, democracy and liberty are not going to go away just because you bring in more draconian regulations,” he said.A ban on masks would appear to be a limited use of emergency powers, but government critics say they believe it could serve as a way to test public and legal reaction, and pave the way for more extensive controls.“It will be tempting [for the government] to expand its use to other areas, such as cancelling the district council elections scheduled for November and declaring a curfew,” said Kenneth Chan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and former lawmaker.A new Hong Kong extradition law is proposed, which would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for a variety of crimes.

"A group of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists have been sentenced to prison for their role in the Umbrella Movement protests, with two of its leaders jailed for 16 months.A district court judge jailed sociology professor Chan Kin-man, 60, law professor Benny Tai, 54, and Baptist minister the Rev Chu Yiu-ming, 75, to 16 months each for conspiracy to commit public nuisance. Chu’s sentence was suspended for two years.The men were the founders of the social movement Occupy Central with Love and Peace and were among nine pro-democracy campaigners convicted over their leadership in the “umbrella movement” rallies in Hong Kong in 2014, which triggered a massive city-wide strike for democratic elections.The group were found guilty earlier this month on rarely used colonial-era public nuisance charges for their roles in the 2014 protests calling for free elections, the largest civil disobedience movement in the city’s history.District court judge Johnny Chan said none of the defendants expressed any regret.“Regret does not mean giving up their political beliefs or demands, but regret for the inconvenience or sufferings experienced by the public,” Chan said. “It is an apology the public rightly deserves from the defendants but was never received.”Raphael Wong and Shiu Ka-chun were sentenced to eight months while former student leader Eason Chung and Democratic party member Lee Wing-tat were given eight-month sentences suspended for two years.Tommy Cheung was given a community service order of 200 hours. After the hearing, he walked through a crowd of supporters, stunned.“I don’t think they deserved a 16 month sentence. I was quite shocked,” he said. “I don’t think people who fight for Hong Kong society should be treated like that.”Tanya Chan’s sentencing was delayed to June after revealing she needed a scan for a brain tumour. Her counsel said the issue was life-threatening. Chan, who blinked back tears as she hugged her fellow defendants, will be sentenced on June 10.Outside of court, hundreds of chanting supporters wearing yellow, the colour of the protest, waved banners.Some wore yellow T-shirts with a slogan written in Chinese: “I was not incited”. It was a sly criticism against one of the colonial-era charges lodged against several defendants: inciting others to cause public nuisance.“Thou shall not speak. That’s the message,” said Kam Tsang, a veteran protester who held aloft a banner that urged “Fight for Universal Suffrage.”Man-kei Tam, Amnesty International’s Hong Kong director, said: “Today’s appalling jail sentences … are an affront to justice and the human rights to peaceful protest and freedom of expression. All four are prisoners of conscience imprisoned solely for peacefully advocating for democracy for Hong Kong, and they must be immediately and unconditionally released and have their sentences overturned.”Maya Wang, the Hong Kong-based chief researcher for China at Human Rights Watch, said the sentences sent “a chilling warning to all that there will be serious consequences for advocating for democracy”.Public officials, including Chris Patten, Hong Kong’s last governor when it was under British rule, rebuked the government for bringing charges so long after the event.The activists planned to use civil disobedience tactics and occupy Hong Kong’s central business district in hopes that Beijing would allow Hong Kong voters to choose the city’s leader for the first time in history in 2017.The Occupy Central founders planned a sit-in of two or three days. The protests were joined by a large number of university students who stormed a civic square near the government headquarters. After the police doused the crowd in pepper spray and tear gas, tens of thousands of residents joined the action.In his ruling issued earlier this month, the judge agreed that Tai, Chan and Chu had requested that the protest remain peaceful, but said that the concept of civil disobedience was not a defence to a criminal charge.",'Umbrella nine' Hong Kong pro-democracy leaders sentenced to jail,2019-04-24/11:58:28,a group of hong kong pro democracy activists have been sentenced to prison for their role in the umbrella movement protests with two of its leaders jailed for  months a district court judge jailed sociology professor chan kin man  law professor benny tai  and baptist minister the rev chu yiu ming  to  months each for conspiracy to commit public nuisance chu s sentence was suspended for two years the men were the founders of the social movement occupy central with love and peace and were among nine pro democracy campaigners convicted over their leadership in the umbrella movement rallies in hong kong in  which triggered a massive city wide strike for democratic elections the group were found guilty earlier this month on rarely used colonial era public nuisance charges for their roles in the  protests calling for free elections the largest civil disobedience movement in the city s history district court judge johnny chan said none of the defendants expressed any regret regret does not mean giving up their political beliefs or demands but regret for the inconvenience or sufferings experienced by the public chan said it is an apology the public rightly deserves from the defendants but was never received raphael wong and shiu ka chun were sentenced to eight months while former student leader eason chung and democratic party member lee wing tat were given eight month sentences suspended for two years tommy cheung was given a community service order of  hours after the hearing he walked through a crowd of supporters stunned i don t think they deserved a  month sentence i was quite shocked he said i don t think people who fight for hong kong society should be treated like that tanya chan s sentencing was delayed to june after revealing she needed a scan for a brain tumour her counsel said the issue was life threatening chan who blinked back tears as she hugged her fellow defendants will be sentenced on june  outside of court hundreds of chanting supporters wearing yellow the colour of the protest waved banners some wore yellow t shirts with a slogan written in chinese i was not incited it was a sly criticism against one of the colonial era charges lodged against several defendants inciting others to cause public nuisance thou shall not speak that s the message said kam tsang a veteran protester who held aloft a banner that urged fight for universal suffrage man kei tam amnesty international s hong kong director said today s appalling jail sentences are an affront to justice and the human rights to peaceful protest and freedom of expression all four are prisoners of conscience imprisoned solely for peacefully advocating for democracy for hong kong and they must be immediately and unconditionally released and have their sentences overturned maya wang the hong kong based chief researcher for china at human rights watch said the sentences sent a chilling warning to all that there will be serious consequences for advocating for democracy public officials including chris patten hong kong s last governor when it was under british rule rebuked the government for bringing charges so long after the event the activists planned to use civil disobedience tactics and occupy hong kong s central business district in hopes that beijing would allow hong kong voters to choose the city s leader for the first time in history in  the occupy central founders planned a sit in of two or three days the protests were joined by a large number of university students who stormed a civic square near the government headquarters after the police doused the crowd in pepper spray and tear gas tens of thousands of residents joined the action in his ruling issued earlier this month the judge agreed that tai chan and chu had requested that the protest remain peaceful but said that the concept of civil disobedience was not a defence to a criminal charge ,Hong Kong Protests,0.233239919
"Thousands of Hong Kong’s legal professionals have staged a march to put pressure on the city’s Department of Justice over what they say are political prosecutions of protesters, after China said the territory was facing its worst crisis since it was handed back from Britain in 1997.In the scorching midday heat about 3,000 people gathered in the heart of Hong Kong’s financial district to call on the justice secretary, Teresa Cheng, to answer allegations of politically motivated prosecution, with dozens of protesters held in police stations across the semi-autonomous city.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong“We see there has been selective prosecution,” said a 29-year-old litigator who would only give her name as JL.Referring to attacks on demonstrators by suspected triads, she said: “The [lack of prosecutions over the] white shirt attack in Yuen Long, compared to the speed of charging so-called rioters, there’s a difference in how police handle the case.”JL was part of the thick line of legal professionals dressed sombrely in black snaking 200 metres uphill from the court of final appeals to the offices of the justice department.It is rare for the city’s legal sector to take part in protests. “People are sceptical,” she said. “We need to restore that trust [of the legal sector] in society and that’s why we’re here today.”“All we want is justice, all we want is consistency, we don’t want to see thugs get away while the best of our youth get prosecuted,” said Kevin Yam, a solicitor.“We ask for justice, we ask for consistency, we ask for proper record keeping. Nothing more, nothing less.”Yam said those trying to get information from the DOJ were being told verbally, and questioned why they were not being provided with documentation. “If we said that I think we’d be in trouble, don’t you think?”The DOJ issued a statement denying the accusations, saying prosecutors were discharging their “duties fairly and without prejudice or favour”.Hong Kong is in its ninth week of consecutive mass protests, with police stating on Tuesday that they fired 800 grenades of teargas the previous day as they tried to disperse demonstrations in at least seven districts.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. The protests began in opposition to a now-suspended extradition law, which would have allowed suspects to be tried in mainland Chinese courts. They have now broadened, turning into a backlash against the government, fuelled by many residents’ fears of eroding freedoms under the tightening control of China’s Communist party.Zhang Xiaoming, one of the most senior Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong affairs, spoke about the issue at a meeting set up in Shenzhen to discuss the crisis: “The central government is highly concerned about Hong Kong’s situation, and trying to study, make decisions and arrangements from a strategic and across-the-board level,” Zhang said. “Hong Kong is facing the most serious situation since its return to China.”At a press conference on Tuesday, Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau affairs office of the Chinese government, said: “Don’t misjudge the situation or take restraint as a sign of weakness … don’t underestimate the firm resolve and tremendous power by the central government and people across China to maintain prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.”Australia on Wednesday joined Ireland, the UK, and Japan in issuing Hong Kong travel warnings. More than 5 million people visited Hong Kong in June this year, of which roughly 80% were from mainland China. Still, there are varying reports about whether tourism has been affected by the protests.Police said they arrested 148 people in connection with Monday’s protests, and another nine on Tuesday night. A total of 589 people have been arrested in connection to the protests in the past two months.Hong Kong’s legal system, which was inherited from the British, and the prospect of being extradited to face authoritarian justice in China, was at the heart of the protests when they first broke out earlier this year.Under the Sino-British joint declaration, Hong Kong should maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.But, over the years, Chinese influence over Hong Kong has grown, with its government and legislature tilted in favour of Beijing. Education, publishing and the media have all come under pressure.",Hong Kong's lawyers march against 'political prosecutions',2019-08-07/13:13:52,thousands of hong kong s legal professionals have

"An employee at the UK’s consulate in Hong Kong has been detained by mainland Chinese authorities on his way back to the city, his girlfriend has said.Simon Cheng, 28, was returning from a trip in Shenzhen to his native Hong Kong on 8 August when his girlfriend, Li, stopped receiving communications from him.A spokesman for the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “We are extremely concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen … We are providing support to his family and seeking further information from authorities in Guangdong province and Hong Kong.”Li said Cheng had messaged her just before he went silent. “Ready to pass through the border … pray for me,” he had written.More than 10 days later, Li and Cheng’s family have not been able to get in touch with him. Li said Hong Kong immigration authorities had told her Cheng had been placed under “administrative detention” in mainland China in an unknown location and for unknown reasons.The detention of Cheng, who works in the British consulate as a trade and investment officer for Scottish Development International, comes amid more than two months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that have threatened Beijing’s authority over the city.In a separate development on Tuesday, two police officers were arrested after video emerged of them beating an older man on a hospital trolley, heaping further pressure on a force already facing accusations of brutality.The footage, recorded in late June, shows two uniformed officers assaulting the man with batons and holding a cloth over his mouth. There are no other people in the room as the officers abuse the patient over several minutes. Police said the man was under arrest at the time. Cheng’s detention was first reported by the Hong Kong news site HK01. According to Li, he regularly travels to mainland China for meetings and had gone there most recently for work. Hong Kong immigration officials said in an emailed statement that they had contacted the city’s liaison office in Guangdong province as well as the Hong Kong government “to understand the situation” and provide further assistance to the family.Hong Kong has been rocked by mass protests triggered by a bill that would allow the extradition of suspects to mainland China. Cheng’s case further underlines fears of a lack of transparency and fairness in the mainland Chinese judicial system and the possibility that Hongkongers may be detained for political reasons.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office.

Human rights advocates say torture and other forms of ill treatment are common under this type of detention.Li said she was not aware of Cheng participating in the protests or expressed his position on the movement in any public forums. “As far as I know, he did not attend any of the protests, even the 1 million march. I am just worried about him,” she said.Cheng, who studied political economy at the London School of Economics, described himself as a “social activist” on his Facebook page. In early June, just before the mass protests began, he posted a yellow sign with people holding umbrellas – possibly a reference to the 2014 pro-democracy “Umbrella movement” in Hong Kong – and the words: “It’s the spirit that defines us.”Li, who met Cheng while he was studying in Taiwan – where she is from – has been calling and writing to British, Chinese, and Hong Kong officials for help. “He grew up to be a very caring, diligent and hardworking person,” Li said. “Now, he is missing and detained for no reason. This is deeply distressing for his family and friends.”Li said she and Cheng had discussed marriage, and possibly moving back to Taiwan, but Cheng wanted to remain in Hong Kong. “He said he loves Hong Kong and wanted to sacrifice all he has for his motherland.”More than a million Hong Kong residents defied a police ban and poured into the streets on Sunday in a peaceful march, calling for the withdrawal of the extradition bill and other demands.Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday she would set up “a platform for dialogue” to tackle complaints against the police in the government’s first attempt at conciliation in weeks.A rally in Cheng’s name has been called for outside the British consulate on Wednesday.In recent weeks, Beijing has taken an increasingly hard line against the protests, which it has described as an attempt to start a “colour revolution”. Twitter blocked almost 1,000 accounts associated with the Chinese government on Monday while Facebook also removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts that originated in China.China has repeatedly warned Britain – the former colonial ruler of Hong Kong – against “interference”. Chinese immigration officials have increased checks at the border between mainland China and Hong Kong, detaining people and checking their phones and other devices.Additional reporting by Verna

"As Hong Kong woke up after a night of unprecedented drama, the city was divided on whether protesters who stormed and vandalised the city’s legislature had gone too far in their quest to make their voices heard. Anti-government and anti-police graffiti still adorned pillars and walls as police stood guard while legislators attempted to go about their day.Two main narratives were emerging after the ransacking of the legislature: one that spoke of hopelessness in the face of semi-authoritarian rule, and another that condemned the destruction of property.Pro-democracy figures placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of leader Carrie Lam, saying a government that only listens to a pro-Beijing party had driven young people to desperation.“The protesters who broke into the Legislative Council complex were not rioters. They were not violent,” said activist Joshua Wong, jailed for two months after the 2014 umbrella protests. “They wanted to make the regime hear Hong Kongers’ voice, and they had no other option. “Perhaps not all of you will agree with every single action they took yesterday. But what are a few pieces of glass worth in comparison to the deaths of three young men and women? What are a few portraits worth in comparison to the very survival of Hong Kong as a place?”But pro-establishment figures focused on condemning the violence done to property and lamenting a loss of law and order. Protesters who vandalised the legislature could face up to 10 years in prison should the government chose to prosecute them under rioting charges.“What we saw last night was shocking violence, unprecedented violence and damage to the Legislative Council. No slogan, no demand can justify such violence,” said Regina Ip, chair of the pro-Beijing New People’s party. “Totally unacceptable for a civilised society like Hong Kong.”Some Hong Kong residents questioned why police had apparently stood aside as protesters moved on the legislature, allowing them to break through the windows and inflict extensive damage inside the building.“The strangest thing was, police were there all along in the morning, confronting the protesters and standing guard inside Legco. Suddenly they all disappeared late afternoon, leaving an empty Legco wide open for the protesters to enter. Empty fort strategy much?” wrote the outspoken democracy activist Denise Ho on Twitter.In a later tweet, she added: “The reason why the protesters have resorted to storming into the Legco, is because of this authoritarian government WHO DOES NOT LISTEN.”For the past month, protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland as anger has grown against Hong Kong authorities and morphed into a wider political crisis.Tuesday night’s occupation of the legislature coincided with a massive peaceful protest in which more than half a million people marched through the cityon the anniversary of Hong Kong’s 1997 return to Chinese rule.It remained unclear if public opinion had shifted after the violence at the legislature, but Wong told the Guardian he had “faith and belief in Hong Kongers that they will understand why the protesters did what they did”.Such opinions were reflected on the city’s streets on Tuesday.“Breaking all those things, that was wrong,” said an 80-year-old retiree who gave his name as Mr Zhang, who watched the drama unfold on television. But he added: “The government – they’re not listening.”A 49-year-old businessman, who gave his name as Mr Lai, said he believed the vandalism was understandable – and echoed the suggestion that the police had purposely allowed the protesters to enter the legislature. “[The protesters] just broke the window, it’s not violent at all. You can’t be violent to an object. They set them up.”His wife, Karen Lai, 48, a financial services worker, added: “In general the older generation are more pro-Beijing. They don’t understand what the younger generation is fighting for, all they see is disruption, and they can’t see past that.”Frederick Chan, a 31-year-old graduate student who had attended the 16 June 2 Million Person March, said he was “furious” the Hong Kong government had not listened to its demands.“Most people don’t love to see violence, and we much regret it, but 2 million people should be quite extraordinary.”The rallies reflect fears that China is stamping down on the city’s freedoms and culture with the help of the finance hub’s pro-Beijing leaders.Although returned to Chinese rule in 1997, Hong Kong is still administered separately under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems”. The city enjoys rights and liberties unseen on the autocratic mainland, but many residents believe Beijing is reneging on that deal.The city’s former no 2 official Anson Chan called for the government to address the deeper issues at hand.“Violence does not solve anything, but I think the chief executive and the governing team should ask themselves what has led to this degree of violence?” said Chan to reporters. Chan was the chief secretary under the city’s last British governor, Chris Patten, and was the public face of the treaty that ceded Hong Kong back to Chinese rule. “Hong Kong youngsters particularly following the 79-day siege umbrella movement and achieving absolutely nothing, [are] feeling an increasing sense of anger, futility and frustration – the government needs to address this.”Lawmaker Michael Tien – one of the few pro-establishment figures to express concerns over the extradition bill, told reporters that the protests demonstrated the need for political reform. Calls for engagement with the protesters are spreading, including from members of the the legal and business community.The Law Society of Hong Kong deplored the “serious criminal damage” inflicted on Monday night, but called on the government and public to “respect others, work together, restore trust and confidence and move forward”. They also appeared to question police inaction, adding: “The police should take appropriate action to prevent criminal violence, secure observance of the law and uphold order for the protection of life and property.”",Hong Kong protests: city divided over storming of legislature,2019-07-02/17:57:08,as hong kong woke up after a night of unprecedented drama the city was divided on whether protesters who stormed and vandalised the city s legislature had gone too far in their quest to make their voices heard anti government and anti police graffiti still adorned pillars and walls as police stood guard while legislators attempted to go about their day two main narratives were emerging after the ransacking of the legislature one that spoke of hopelessness in the face of semi authoritarian rule and another that condemned the destruction of property pro democracy figures placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of leader carrie lam saying a government that only listens to a pro beijing party had driven young people to desperation the protesters who broke into the legislative council complex were not rioters they were not violent said activist joshua wong jailed for two months after the  umbrella protests they wanted to make the regime hear hong kongers voice and they had no other option perhaps not all of you will agree with every single action they took yesterday but what are a few pieces of glass worth in comparison to the deaths of three young men and women what are a few portraits worth in comparison to the very survival of hong kong as a place but pro establishment figures focused on condemning the violence done to property and lamenting a loss of law and order protesters who vandalised the legislature could face up to  years in prison should the government chose to prosecute them under rioting charges what we saw last night was shocking violence unprecedented violence and damage to the legislative council no slogan no demand can justify such violence said regina ip chair of the pro beijing new people s party totally unacceptable for a civilised society like hong kong some hong kong residents questioned why police had apparently stood

"Hong Kong’s leader has described a extradition bill that has prompted weeks of mass protests as “dead”, but held back from completely withdrawing it, drawing criticism from her opponents who have promised to return to the streets.At a press conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was “reaching the end of its life”. Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month.In the city’s sharpest challenge to Beijing’s rule in decades, millions of Hong Kong residents have taken to the streets in opposition to legislation that would allow extraditions to China.Many see the proposed law as an encroachment on the territory’s autonomy, promised under the “one country, two systems” principle established when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997. Critics worry Beijing will use the law to extradite activists and political enemies to China. “We suspended it and we have no timetable,” Lam said. “What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response … the bill has actually died. So people won’t need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.”Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: “I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us. Otherwise the Civil Human Rights Front will plan our next action.”Joshua Wong, a student leader during the mass pro-democracy protests in 2014 and secretary general of the Demosisto party, said: “The core of this political movement is the demand for free elections, because all governance crisis stems from the political inequality. Protests continue.”1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. Others criticised Lam’s refusal to formally withdraw the bill. Lokman Tsui, who teaches journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said: “‘Officially dead’ is not a legal or political term. So it’s still unclear whether it is withdrawn, and we can only assume it is not since she still has not said those words.”Public opinion of Lam, a target of protesters who see her as a lackey for Beijing, has reached a new low and few trust her pledges.One protester, who would only give his surname, Ip, said: “She said the bill is dead but in the legislative rules, there is only ‘postpone’ or ‘withdrawal’. I absolutely don’t trust her verbal promises.”On Facebook, comments posted under a live stream of Lam’s speech were critical. One posted: “So stubborn … she said nothing! Just suspended!!” Another said: “We need withdrawal!”Pronouncing the bill dead while not withdrawing it appears to be a political compromise. Lam, who ultimately answers to Beijing, described the government’s response as the result of “deliberations of the various concerns and factors” and a “practical measure for us to move ahead”.She also refused several of the protesters’ key demands, including her resignation and an independent investigation into police wrongdoing. Protesters and residents have accused the police of using excessive force against demonstrators. Lam has made one concession, however: public discussions with student protesters. Previously she had only agreed to closed-door talks.Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said: “She is still trying hard to put up this strong leader face, refusing to succumb to the people … that could send a dangerous message to mainland dissent too. Lam thinks she can stop a hill fire using a garden hose, but the young are neither giving in, nor giving up.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongHundreds of protesters clashed with police at the weekend as they blocked streets in the commercial district of Kowloon after a march earlier in the day. Six people were arrested. Activists accused authorities of using excessive force on demonstrators and journalists.The crisis in Hong Kong has spread beyond the territory. China has criticised “British intervention” after the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, stressed London’s support for Hong Kong’s freedom.Last week, the outgoing US consul general, Kurt Tong, was barred by the US state department from giving a critical speech on government actions in Hong Kong for fear it would derail a temporary trade truce between Washington and Beijing, according to the Financial Times.According to the report, citing people familiar with the matter, Tong had planned a “kick-ass” speech to be delivered on 2 July at the Asia Society in Hong Kong, describing Beijing’s growing influence over the territory. Instead, the speech was watered down and made off the record at the last minute.On Tuesday Beijing criticised the pro-democracy Hong Kong singer Denise Ho after she called for the UN to remove China from the body’s human rights council for trying to erode the city’s autonomy.Ho was repeatedly interrupted by a Chinese diplomat while she spoke at the UN on Monday. On Tuesday a foreign ministry spokesman told a press briefing Ho was “delusional” and had “overestimated herself”.

"Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam has said that she has never offered to step down, a day after an audio recording emerged of her saying she would quit if she had “a choice”.In a press conference on Tuesday, Lam did not deny veracity of the audio, but told reporters: “I have never tendered resignation to the central people’s government. I have not even contemplated tendering resignation ... The choice of not resigning is my own choice.” She added: “The reason being I believe I can lead my team to come out of this impasse.”Her comments came less than 24 hours after a leaked audio recording, obtained by Reuters, was published. In it, the chief executive can be heard saying she was “very, very limited” in how her government could respond to the mass protests that began in June over a proposal to allow extradition to mainland China.“For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable. If I have a choice, the first thing [I would do] is to quit, having made a deep apology,” Lam is heard saying in the recording.The remarks suggested Beijing has been directing the Hong Kong government’s response to months of mass protests that have plunged the semi-autonomous territory into its worst political crisis since it was returned to Chinese control in 1997.Over the last three months of protests, which began over a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China and has since turned into a broader democracy movement that has challenged Beijing’s authority over the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.In a press briefing on Tuesday, China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not address the recording and reiterated its support of Lam. Spokesman Yang Guang condemned the protesters and accused some of trying to launch a “colour revolution” to establish Hong Kong independence.“From their faces, we can see four words. On the left: oppose China. And on the right: ‘Hong Kong independence,’ he said. “Hong Kong’s sovereignty belongs to China and to the 1.4 billion Chinese people.”Referring to one of the slogans of the protest, “If we burn, you burn with us,” Yang said: “I don’t know how you feel, but I distinctly smell terror and madness.”In July, a month after protests began, Lam shelved the controversial bill, proclaiming it “dead”. But demonstrators, fearing the bill could be revived, have continued to protest and demand its permanent withdrawal. Lam has refused the protesters other demands, which include launching an inquiry into police behaviour toward protesters and implementing direct elections.Reuters reported earlier this month that Beijing had refused a proposal to de-escalate the crisis, ordering Lam not to concede to any demands, even more politically palatable ones such as a formal withdrawal of the bill and police inquiry.In the press conference, Lam called the leak “very inappropriate” and said was attempting to offer the perspective of “an individual” where resigning “might be an easy choice.”“But I told myself repeatedly in past months that I and my team should stay on to help Hong Kong. That is my decision. I know it is not going to be an easy path.”The press conference comes as Hong Kong braces for another day of protests, after a weekend of some of the most intense clashes of the last three months.On Tuesday, riot police patrolled the city as protesters vowed to come out again and students continued a class boycott that started on Monday. In a video posted online, police were seen chasing secondary school students and tackling one to the ground.More than 200 students and alumni of the the Church of Christ in China Ming Yin College formed a human chain around the school chanting: “Reclaim Hong Kong!” The group scattered after a report that police were coming to the scene, according to public broadcaster RTHK.Police, who have now arrested more than 1,000 people since June, detained several organisers, including student union president Keith Fong of Baptist University, who has been supportive of the boycott. Fong was detained Monday night for alleged theft while police arrested Ivan Lam, chairman of the pro-democracy political organisation Demosisto as he arrived at the Hong Kong airport on Tuesday morning.Michael Mo, who helped organise marches in the New Territories, was detained at his home on suspicion of illegal assembly, according to a statement released by a friend.As the protests continue with few signs of stopping, the government has hinted it could deploy an emergency ordinance that gives Lam sweeping powers to restore “public order”.The colonial era law, last used to put down riots in 1967, mean the government could censor media and suppress communications, as well as arrest, detain, deport and search residents as it deems necessary.Lam refused to rule out the use of the law, saying: “As a government we have the responsibility to see what we have in our existent law that can deal with the unrest. If the violence calms down then there would be no need to do this.”",Hong Kong protests: Carrie Lam denies offering to resign,2019-09-03/10:37:59,hong kong s embattled leader carrie lam has said that

"The activist Joshua Wong has called for Germany to stop the export of riot control weapons and equipment to Hong Kong police, as he embarked on a global tour to promote his pro-democracy message.Hong Kong police were using water cannon manufactured in Germany to suppress the protests against a proposed new extradition bill that flared up on the streets of the city in late March, the prominent activist said. “They [German manufacturers] should not be the supporters of Hong Kong riot police.”After a meeting with Germany’s foreign minister and ahead of a series of speaking engagements in the US, Wong appealed to Germany to suspend trade negotiations with China until the government of Xi Jinping puts on the agenda human rights laws “that respect European standards”.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong“Hong Kong can serve as an example for the world to learn from,” Wong told the audience at a press conference in Berlin. For too long, the 22-year-old said, authorities in the semi-autonomous region had been unaware of the ways in which the Chinese Communist party used trade to turn its “one country, two systems” motto into “one country, one-and-a-half systems”.“China uses the Belt and Road initiative as a way to increase and expand its economic influence and political gain – not just in Hong Kong, China, Asia Pacific, but also in Europe,” he said.Wong and fellow founders of the Demosisto political party had arrived in the German capital on Monday, where he was feted by politicians and media commentators at a party in the rooftop restaurant of the Reichstag building on Monday night hosted by the tabloid Bild.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said her government will formally withdraw the bill that ignited months of protests. Hong Kong residents had feared it could be used by China to extradite people for political reasons. They want guarantees that it cannot be reintroduced at a later date.Protesters want the government to officially recognise that their movement has been a series of legitimate protests, rather than a riot, as has been stated in official communications.Hundreds of people have been arrested in recent weeks, and the protesters are demanding that all of them be freed, and that no convictions should stand against any of them.Police use of force has escalated since the demonstrations began, while protesters have also resorted to increasingly violent measures. Demonstrators say an inquiry into police brutality is the number-one priority.Hong Kong's chief executive is currently selected by a 1,200-member committee, and nearly half of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by limited electorates representing different sectors of the economy. The protesters want to be able to vote for their leaders in free and open democratic elections. A meeting with the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas – photos of which Wong tweeted from his official account – drew anger from the Chinese government, which said the encounter was “disrespectful” of Beijing’s sovereignty.The Chinese ambassador to Germany on Wednesday said the meeting had sent out “very negative signals”, and confirmed his German counterpart in China had been officially summoned by the Beijing foreign ministry in protest. Ambassador Wu Ken added that China had sufficient evidence that foreign forces intervened in Hong Kong during protests.Wong was charged last month with inciting people to join a protest in June, and is out on bail. He was sentenced to two months in prison in May on a contempt charge after pleading guilty to obstructing the clearance of a major protest camp in 2014.Speaking to German media on Wednesday, he said: “The air of freedom I breathe here, instead of the irritative smell of teargas, reminds me how important it is for me to share the thoughts of people who attend the protests in Hong Kong right now.”A meeting with the chancellor, Angela Merkel, who was on a state visit to China last week, did not materialise during his trip, and Wong appeared reluctant to comment on attempts to contact the German leader. His global tour, he said, was focused on meeting with lawmakers to build up bipartisan support for his cause.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. “Next time I come to visit Berlin, it would be great to have the chance to meet with anyone from the office of the foreign minister, or even the chancellor.” Merkel was criticised in parliament on Wednesday morning for failing to arrange a meeting with the protest leader.Wong will meet US media in New York on Friday and move on to Washington next week, where he is seeking to lobby Democratic and Republican politicians to support the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would require the US government to regularly reassess Hong Kong’s level of political autonomy to determine whether it should continue to have a special trade status.In Berlin, Wong said he hoped to carry his pro-democracy message even to China: “First is Hong Kong, next is mainland China.”“We hope for more and more people who live in mainland China to recognise the importance of universal values and freedom. Three decades ago, the Berlin Wall fell, and we hope that in the future, the great firewall of China will also fall.”",Hong Kong activist to Germany: stop selling riot control kit to

"“We are officially in a police state,” the Hong Kong Cantopop star and activist Denise Ho told a sold-out audience in Sydney on Sunday night.Speaking at the Sydney Opera House’s Antidote festival, Ho told an audience of mostly self-identifying Hongkongers that the political upheaval in their home had reached “a point of no turning back”.“We are in a state of humanitarian crisis where police have full authority to do whatever they want with the people, and the government is hiding behind the police force,” she said.As protests in Hong Kong headed towards their 14th week, Ho reflected on the resilience and tenacity of the protesters, who have turned out in hundreds of thousands since the first demonstrations in June.“Where does this courage come from? Hong Kong has never been known to be a politically conscious society,” she said. “Nothing like this has ever been seen before and now people have been pushed to this edge – these young people are fighting for their lives and for their future.”She rejected allegations by Beijing that the movement was being provoked by the US or other international players. “This is a leaderless, centralised movement,” she said. “They are still claiming there are foreign forces coming into the movement … it’s just not the truth.”Before she was an activist, Ho was a singer. She launched her music career in the 1990s when she won a singing competition run by a Hong Kong TV station, but it wasn’t until the early 2000s that she broke through into the mainstream. She began to identify publicly as a lesbian in 2012 – the first person in Cantopop to come out – and became an advocate for LGBT+ rights.In 2014 she was arrested for taking part in the “umbrella movement” for universal suffrage in Hong Kong. As a result she was blacklisted in mainland China, where she had a growing audience, and was dropped from major sponsorship deals and by her record label. She responded by starting her own label, and by intensifying her political activism.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office.

China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongDespite being billed as a talk about pop and politics, Ho’s session at the annual ideas festival focused firmly on the latter. In conversation with the journalist Zing Tsjeng, Ho touched on her singing career only insofar as it related to her activism.Art and creative practice, she said, was a space in which “the fight can go on”. “They can lock you up, they can ban you from going into the country, and they can censor your name on Chinese social media, but they cannot really control your mind.”She said she believed most celebrities had been “silencing themselves” on the political situation in Hong Kong “for fear of being blacklisted, as I have been, on the China market”.The audience gave no indication that they minded the singular focus of the event. Crowd members chanted pro-freedom slogans. Questions from the floor were focused mainly on protest strategy. They wanted to know what they could do from Australia to help their families at home. They called out in encouragement and support when the event took an emotional turn.Ho was brought to tears as the audience was shown a short video summarising the months of protests, which were triggered in June by the introduction of a bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to mainland China to face court. The bill was seen as an attempt by Beijing to undermine democracy in the relatively liberal territory, governed by China under the “one country, two systems” framework.News had emerged in the past 48 hours that police had fired dye-filled water cannons at people in the street. They had disguised their identities and violently arrested protesters, as well as attacking them in a train carriage at a metro station, pepper spraying them and beating them with batons.“The police have really been completely out of hand, and so Hong Kong people are furious,” Ho said.Ho said she expected the crisis to escalate in the lead-up to celebrations on 1 October to mark the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.“What will happen during this month, nobody will really answer this question,” she said. “What we can really do in this moment is become more united in this fight and become really strategic in the face of this huge machine that is the [Chinese] communist government.”She said six young people had killed themselves “because of despair” during the protest period.“I really want the world to know that although we are seeing a lot of violence from all sides at this moment, this really started out as a largely peaceful protest in June,” she said.“We tried all sorts of ways to get our voices heard, to get to the government. But they only responded with teargas, more teargas, rubber bullets, sponge bullets, police brutality.”",Denise Ho: Hong Kong has reached 'a point of no turning back',2019-09-01/23:11:16, we are

"LONDON   - Fallout from Brexit has helped New York overtake London to become the world’s pre-eminent financial centre, a survey of financial executives by Duff & Phelps showed on Tuesday. The consultants said their annual Global Regulatory Outlook survey contacted 180 executives in asset management, private equity, hedge funds, banking and brokerage. They were asked where they think the top financial centre is located. More than 60% of responses were from Britain and the United States, with the rest mainly from Hong Kong, Ireland, Singapore and Luxembourg. Just over half of respondents now see New York as the world’s top financial centre, up 10% from 2018, while 36% see London as the leader, down 17% from last year. “Last year, Brexit cast a shadow of uncertainty over the United Kingdom’s economy; it has now escalated to a full-blown crisis,” Duff & Phelps said. “Looking ahead, however, globalisation’s diffusion of influence begins to be apparent: 12% of respondents expect Hong Kong to be the world’s preeminent financial centre five years from now.” British government ministers said last week that the UK financial sector would emerge stronger from Brexit. Duff & Phelps said Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg also fared better this year as the European Union’s financial industry searches for a new hub. Britain’s departure from the EU has already been delayed twice, with the next deadline set for Oct. 31, and uncertainty over future bilateral trade relations has prompted banks, asset managers and insurers to set up operations in the bloc to maintain links with customers.

"The memories of the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen Square’s pro-democracy protests 30 years ago are sharpening. Hong Kong is heading down the path of no return, warns Carrie Lam, its chief executive. Beijing’s rhetoric is more threatening still, with an official warning of “terrorism” in the city. China’s state media has shown paramilitary police troop carriers apparently massing in Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong.Ten weeks after the protests began in reaction to the anti-extradition bill, the impact is growing, the mood is turning uglier and violence is spiralling. For now, Beijing’s intent still seems to be intimidation, not direct action. Brute force by the People’s Liberation Army or mainland paramilitaries is likely to be its last resort. But hardline language, harsh policing, attacks by thugs and punitive charges have not exhausted activists. They have only inflamed matters.Tuesday saw a new level of violence at the airport – extraordinary clashes with police, and protesters hitting two suspected undercover officers even as others tried to protect them. Such assaults are unjustifiable and many in Hong Kong – including activists – will rightly revile them. Protests that target symbols of authority have won a remarkable degree of support in a city that once prided itself on its political caution and conservatism. But the airport occupation, which led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights, and especially the attacks there, take the movement into new territory. The astounding backing that protesters have won – with finance professionals, medics, lawyers and even civil servants taking to the streets – could easily fray.The aggression of some participants has been fuelled not only by the government’s intransigence but by brutal police tactics, including firing tear gas into a metro station, and directly at protesters. A woman may have lost an eye after she was hit in the face, apparently by a beanbag round. The UN human rights office has urged the Hong Kong government to launch an inquiry after reviewing what it calls credible evidence of police employing these kinds of weapons in ways that are prohibited by international norms and standards, “creating a considerable risk of death or serious injury”. The use of undercover police has fuelled suspicion of provocateurs.Authorities have done their best to stamp protest leadership out in recent years. Two of the founders of the 2014 Occupy movement, academics Chan Kin-man and Benny Tai, are locked up in maximum security prisons for their role; many more activists have served time. Elected legislators have been disqualified. The lessons that many have drawn are that protests are the only way to make themselves heard; that no one should take the lead; and that they are bound to pay heavily for their activism when the protests end. None of these are conducive to an early end to the disorder.While the leaderless quality of the movement may offer it flexibility and resilience, it also makes it far harder to channel. The protesters are far more sophisticated, politically astute, informed and connected than 1989’s students – they have grown up with a lively civil society and strong traditions of protest and free expression, the very things they want to protect from Beijing’s encroachments. Yet, as in 1989, these protests have developed their own momentum and cannot easily be controlled.The Communist party does not want to mar the celebrations of its 70th year in power on 1 October. But if protests show no sign of ebbing before then, might it decide that it is better to act sooner rather than later? The demonstrators should give Beijing no excuse for violent suppression. But the behaviour of a small minority does not justify a ruthless response to the movement as a whole. The UK and other governments should remind China of the political and economic costs attached to violent suppression of these protests.",The Guardian view on Hong Kong: on the brink,2019-08-13/18:42:06,the memories of the bloody crackdown on tiananmen square s pro democracy protests  years ago are sharpening hong kong is heading down the path of no return warns carrie lam its chief executive beijing s rhetoric is more threatening still with an official warning of terrorism in the city china s state media has shown paramilitary police troop carriers apparently massing in shenzhen bordering hong kong ten weeks after the protests began in reaction to the anti extradition bill the impact is growing the mood is turning uglier and violence is spiralling for now beijing s intent still seems to be intimidation not direct action brute force by the people s liberation army or mainland paramilitaries is likely to be its last resort but hardline language harsh policing attacks by thugs and punitive charges have not exhausted activists they have only inflamed matters tuesday saw a new level of violence at the airport extraordinary clashes with police and protesters hitting two suspected undercover officers even as others tried to protect them such assaults are unjustifiable and many in hong kong including activists will rightly revile them protests that target symbols of authority have won a remarkable degree of support in a city that once prided itself on its political caution and conservatism but the airport occupation which led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and especially the attacks there take the movement into new territory the astounding backing that protesters have won with finance professionals medics lawyers and even civil servants taking to the streets could easily fray the aggression of some participants has been fuelled not only by the government s intransigence but by brutal police tactics including firing tear gas into a metro station and directly at protesters a woman may have lost an eye after she was hit in the face apparently by a beanbag round the un human rights office has urged the hong kong government to launch an inquiry after reviewing what it calls credible evidence of police employing these kinds of weapons in ways that are prohibited by international norms and standards creating a considerable risk of death or serious injury the use of undercover police has fuelled suspicion of provocateurs authorities have done their best to stamp protest leadership out in recent years two of the founders of the  occupy movement academics chan kin man and benny tai are locked up in maximum security prisons for their role many more activists have served time elected legislators have been disqualified the lessons that many have drawn are that protests are the only way to make themselves heard that no one should take the lead and that they are bound to pay heavily for their activism when the protests end none of these are conducive to an early end to the disorder while the leaderless quality of the movement may offer it flexibility and resilience it also makes it far harder to channel the protesters are far more sophisticated politically astute informed and connected than  s students they have grown up with a lively civil society and strong traditions of protest and free expression the very things they want to protect from beijing s encroachments yet as in  these protests have developed their own momentum and cannot easily be controlled the communist party does not want to mar the celebrations of its th year in power on  october but if protests show no sign of ebbing before then might it decide that it is better to act sooner rather than later the demonstrators should give beijing no excuse for violent suppression but the behaviour of a small minority does not justify a ruthless response to the movement as a whole the uk and other governments should remind china of the political and economic costs attached to violent suppression of these protests ,Hong Kong Protests,0.21729055
"Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, is the person responsible for mobilising the biggest protests in the city’s history, the freed student activist Joshua Wong has said.The 22-year-old, who was the face of the last major demonstrations in Hong Kong in 2014, was released from jail on Monday following a two-month term for contempt of court.He said that despite Lam’s “sincere and solemn” apology at a press conference, and her hint that the extradition law that sparked this month’s mass protests had been effectively retracted, the chief executive had not met any of her critics’ demands.“For the 2 million-strong protest, all she said was sorry, but she has completely ignored public opinion,” Wong told the Guardian. “She couldn’t even make a promise that she won’t revive the bill within her tenure.”Lam promised only that she would not revive the extradition law – which would allow Hong Kongers to be extradited to a Chinese justice system where the conviction rate is often as high as 99% – before it expires in July next year, and she refused to step down before her term ends in 2022.Protesters are demanding she fully withdraw the extradition law and account for police brutality during the demonstrations, in which riot officers used rubber bullets and tear gas. They also want her to release those arrested, refrain from calling last week’s protest a riot, and resign.Messages on social media indicate that unless these demands are addressed before 5pm on Thursday, demonstrators will rally in front of the government headquarters the following day.“Against the backdrop of the G20 meeting, she is essentially mobilising people to take to the streets and embarrassing [the Chinese president] Xi Jinping,” said Wong. The 2019 G20 summit of the world’s leading economies will be held in Japan on 28 and 29 June.Wong acknowledged, however, that, in a semi-autonomous city where there are civil freedoms but no democracy, forcing the government to indefinitely suspend the bill was “a symbolic achievement even if not a complete victory”.The poor living conditions in Hong Kong’s prisons, such as being allowed to change uniform only once every four days despite having no air conditioning in sub-tropical heat, did not seem to have dented Wong’s determination. The secretary general of the Demosistō party said he regretted missing out on the mass protests of the past 10 days and was looking forward to joining any further actions.Despite his youth, Wong is a seasoned activist. At 15, he became the face of a campaign which in 2012 forced the authorities to shelve a plan to introduce “national education” to Hong Kong schools. He was one of the leaders of the 2014 “umbrella movement”, which began when he was just about to turn 18.Asked whether he would like to be the leader of the next set of protests, Wong sidestepped. He said: “As an organic movement, the anti-extradition protest is very decentralised. The key is not who is leading it.”Many learned about the protests through messaging services, such as WhatsApp and Telegram, or via social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. “When a movement has no leaders, it constitutes even greater pressure on the authorities to give concessions because they have no one to negotiate with and they can’t just go and arrest one of the leaders,” he said.The opposition to the extradition bill came from not only the pro-democracy camp and young people, but also the business sector. The huge turnout for the protests – an estimated 1 million on 9 June and nearly 2 million on 16 June, were beyond anyone’s imagination, Wong said.“The price they are paying for turning Hong Kong into a war zone is that they get to find out that the people’s reaction can be so strong,” Wong said.He said Hong Kong people had been fighting to retain their freedoms since they came under Chinese rule in 1997 – from the opposition to a subversion law in 2003 which prompted500,000 to march, to the recent demonstrations. Each time, the fighting spirit grew stronger, he said.“They have already radicalised a whole generation of young people,” Wong said.But even under the “one country two systems” policy – which China pledged to stick to for 50 years after Britain handed over its former colony – Hong Kong has limited room to manoeuvre politically and the ultimate goal of democracy seems remote.Asked whether he could face the same fate as the Chinese student leaders who went into exile after the crackdown on the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement 30 years ago, Wong said: “We don’t want to end up like them; that’s why we are doing what we are doing now.”","Carrie Lam's failures have radicalised new generation, says freed activist",2019-06-18/23:34:58,hong kong s leader carrie lam is the person responsible for mobilising the biggest protests in the city s history the freed student activist joshua wong has said the  year old who was the face of the last major demonstrations in hong kong in  was released from jail on monday following a two month term for contempt of court he said that despite lam s sincere and solemn apology at a press conference and her hint that the extradition law that sparked this month s mass protests had been effectively retracted the chief executive had not met any of her critics demands for the  million strong protest all she said was sorry but she has completely ignored public opinion wong told the guardian she couldn t even make a promise that she won t revive the bill within her tenure lam promised only that she would not revive the extradition law which would allow hong kongers to be extradited to a chinese justice system where the conviction rate is often as high as  before it expires in july next year and she refused to step down before her term ends in  protesters are demanding she fully withdraw the extradition law and account for police brutality during the demonstrations in which riot officers used rubber bullets and tear gas they also want her to release those arrested refrain from calling last week s protest a riot and resign messages on social media indicate that unless these demands are addressed before pm on thursday demonstrators will rally in front of the government headquarters the following day against the backdrop of the g meeting she is essentially mobilising people to take to the streets and embarrassing the chinese president xi jinping said wong the  g summit of the world s leading economies will be held in japan on  and  june wong acknowledged however that in a semi autonomous city where there are civil freedoms but no democracy forcing the government to indefinitely suspend the bill was a symbolic achievement even if not a complete victory the poor living conditions in hong kong s prisons such as being allowed to change uniform only once every four days despite having no air conditioning in sub tropical heat did not seem to have dented wong s determination the secretary general of the demosistō party said he regretted missing out on the mass protests of the past  days and was looking forward to joining any further actions despite his youth wong is a seasoned activist at  he became the face of a campaign which in  forced the authorities to shelve a plan to introduce national education to hong kong schools he was one of the leaders of the  umbrella movement which began when he was just about to turn  asked whether he would like to be the leader of the next set of protests wong sidestepped he said as an organic movement the anti extradition protest is very decentralised the key is not who is leading it many learned about the protests through messaging services such as whatsapp and telegram or via social media platforms such as facebook and twitter when a movement has no leaders it constitutes even greater pressure on the authorities to give concessions because they have no one to negotiate with and they can t just go and arrest one of the leaders he said the opposition to the extradition bill came from not only the pro democracy camp and young people but also the business sector the huge turnout for the protests an estimated  million on  june and nearly  million on  june were beyond anyone s imagination wong said the price they are paying for turning hong kong into a war zone is that they get to find out that the people s reaction can be so strong wong said he said hong kong people had been fighting to retain their freedoms since they came under chinese rule in  from the opposition to a subversion law in  which prompted  to march to the recent demonstrations each time the fighting spirit grew stronger he said they have already radicalised a whole generation of young people wong said but even under the one country two systems policy which china pledged to stick to for  years after britain handed over its former colony hong kong has limited room to manoeuvre politically and the ultimate goal of democracy seems remote asked whether he could face the same fate as the chinese student leaders who went into exile after the crackdown on the tiananmen pro democracy movement  years ago wong said we don t want to end up like them that s why we are doing what we are doing now ,Hong Kong Protests,0.216006517
"Hong Kong’s police chief has admitted his officers had sought to arrest wounded demonstrators in hospitals, and acknowledged that only a “minority” had been violent and would face rioting charges.The police commissioner, Stephen Lo Wai-Chung, said officers had followed procedure when he was asked about reports that police used medical records to search hospitals for protesters.“Whenever there are people delivered to the emergency ward, there is a responsibility for police to check whether it is an accident, natural sickness, or [if they were] involved in certain crimes,” he said.“The allegation that we are going to hospitals, chasing people to disturb their treatment, I disagree.”As the city’s crisis entered its second week, protesters kept up pressure on Chief Executive Carrie Lam by re-occupying streets outside the shuttered legislature building and welcoming the city’s most prominent political activist, Joshua Wong, on his release from jail.Hong Kong was electrified by a record march on Sunday, the third major demonstration in a week. Organisers claimed that nearly 2 million people turned out to oppose an extradition law pushed by Lam, called for her resignation, condemned police brutality against protesters and demanded they drop any rioting charges.The police commissioner, Stephen Lo Wai-Chung, refused to apologise for police use of teargas, rubber bullets and truncheons, saying their hand was forced when “a minority” turned to violence on Wednesday.He claimed police use of riot charges for some of those arrested over the showdown, had been misunderstood, however.“We’re not saying that the public gathering on that day was a riot,” Lo told a late night press conference. “Some protesters used violence, that’s why the situation was a riot. As for other peaceful protesters … they need not worry about the riot crime.”Of 32 people arrested over the demonstrations so far, only five have been charged with rioting offences, he said. The legal designation of “riot” has been a focus of concerns because it means protesters face heavier sentences.The response was unlikely to satisfy protesters who marched under slogans including “they are kids, not rioters” and have been emboldened by the government’s unexpected climbdown over the extradition bill.The crowds on Monday were tiny by comparison to Sunday, but participants remained committed. “This is Hong Kong’s future at stake, it’s really important,” said one 29-year-old protester, who had skipped work to attend. He said his boss knew where he was, but asked not to be named because he feared arrest after roundups including hospital detentions.The timing of Wong’s release on Monday after serving half of a two-month sentence on a contempt charge was coincidental. He rose to prominence during the 2014 pro-democracy “umbrella movement”, and had been finishing a sentence for his role in those protests when Hong Kongers took to the streets again.He wasted no time adding his name to the cause. When he arrived at the protest site in the early afternoon, he told reporters he was in the same clothes he wore when he was jailed, not even taking time to return home and wash or change.“[The protests] showed the spirit and dignity of the Hong Kong people,” Wong said. He urged her to withdraw the controversial law and step down.Sunday was the largest demonstration in Hong Kong’s history and the potent display of public anger pushed Lam to apologise for her handling of the crisis in a statement, but she did not respond to demonstrators’ key demands.Many have sworn they will not rest until she goes. “I know this is going to be a serious fight, but I think it is somehow necessary,” said a 22-year-old student who gave his name as Draven.“We all know that just one protest is not going to have any long-term impact; we have to go further to let the government know what we need.” That includes bringing an end to Lam’s leadership, he said.China, which handpicked Lam for the job, has stood by her publicly. The foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday she had the government’s support. But analysts and opposition politicians said her campaign to force through a much-criticised bill, and her repeated misreading of the public mood as Hong Kong’s people rose up against it, had fatally undermined her authority.“Her government cannot be an effective government, and will have much, much, much difficulties to carry on,” the Democratic party legislator James To told the government-funded broadcaster RTHK.The extradition law at the heart of the crisis would allow both residents and visitors to be sent to China for trial in opaque, communist-controlled courts, which many in Hong Kong fear would prove a devastating blow to their economy and society.The city functions as a regional business and trade hub, protected from China by its judicial “firewall”. Without that protection everyone from dissidents to business tycoons could be at risk; some of the city’s wealthy have reportedly already started moving assets abroad over fears about the new law’s impact.Additional reporting by Verna Yu",Hong Kong police chief admits officers sought to arrest wounded protesters in hospital,2019-06-17/18:44:24,hong kong s police chief has admitted his officers

"US president Donald Trump has said he is “concerned” about the risk of a violent Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong, as the city prepared for another weekend of protests.Chinese authorities have stepped up rhetoric against protesters in recent days, likening them to terrorists and threatening to use force to end the demonstrations. Large numbers of paramilitary forces have also been moved to the nearby border city of Shenzhen, where they are drilling in a stadium.Trump said he would urge his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to sit down with protesters, but admitted that was unlikely. “I know it’s not the kind of thing he does,” he told reporters en route to a campaign rally. Trump had previously described the demonstrations as “riots” that China would need to handle internally.The popular uprising, initially sparked by a controversial extradition law, has plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since the handover from British colonial rule in 1997, with escalating violence on both sides.Over 700 people have been arrested since the protests began. Many have been injured as police stepped up use of non-lethal weapons, including teargas, rubber bullets and beanbags. A young woman who was hit in the face may lose an eye.Amnesty International has condemned the police tactics, but protesters also apologised after attacking and tying up two men suspected of being Chinese spies, during a demonstration that shut down the airport for several hours.Further unrest was expected over the weekend, after police refused permission for several protests. A rally scheduled for Friday night called “Stand with Hong Kong, Power to the People” will go ahead.But the Civil Human Rights Front, which organised a 2 million-strong march in June, was denied permission to hold another through central Hong Kong on Sunday, and told it can only rally in a park.The personal authority of Xi, a strongman who has centralised power and extended his mandate indefinitely, is at stake.The protests come at a particularly sensitive time, with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the communist-ruled People’s Republic of China in October; Beijing does not want nationwide celebrations planned for that day overshadowed.The political, cultural and economic clout of the Chinese government has been on display as the showdown intensified, with major companies and celebrities coming to the defence of Hong Kong police and authorities.The resignation of Cathy Pacific CEO Rupert Hogg, effective immediately, came after mounting scrutiny from both Chinese regulators and mainland residents of the role of airline employees in the protest.The company, 30% owned by Air China, has already fired two pilots for taking part in ‘“illegal” demonstrations and warned others could lose their position if they take part in any “illegal activities”.“There is no doubt that our brand and reputation are under immense pressure and this pressure has been growing for some weeks, particularly in the all-important market of mainland China,” Hogg said in an email to all employees on Friday.Positive displays of support for the Hong Kong authorities came from major international firms based there, including Swire and conglomerate Jardine Matheson, which put out a statement saying backed police in “efforts to restore law and order”.Martial arts icon Jackie Chan also sided with authorities, describing the demonstrations as “sad and depressing”, the South China Morning Post reported. He also claimed he had not heard about June’s 2 million-strong peaceful march.Chinese-American actress Liu Yifei, who stars in the upcoming live-action remake of Disney’s Mulan, also put out a message on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, saying, “I also support the Hong Kong police,” and sharing a pro-Beijing image.That decision prompted supporters of the Hong Kong protesters to launch a boycott campaign of the film.",Hong Kong: Trump urges Xi to talk to protesters as weekend rallies loom,2019-08-16/04:39:55,us president donald trump has said he is concerned about the risk of a violent chinese crackdown in hong kong as the city prepared for another weekend of protests chinese authorities have stepped up rhetoric against protesters in recent days likening them to terrorists and threatening to use force to end the demonstrations large numbers of paramilitary forces have also been moved to the nearby border city of shenzhen where they are drilling in a stadium trump said he would urge his chinese counterpart xi jinping to sit down with protesters but admitted that was unlikely i know it s not the kind of thing he does he told reporters en route to a campaign rally trump had previously described the demonstrations as riots that china would need to handle internally the popular uprising initially sparked by a controversial extradition law has plunged hong kong into its worst crisis since the handover from british colonial rule in  with escalating violence on both sides over  people have been arrested since the protests began many have been injured as police stepped up use of non lethal weapons including teargas rubber bullets and beanbags a young woman who was hit in the face may lose an eye amnesty international has condemned the police tactics but protesters also apologised after attacking and tying up two men suspected of being chinese spies during a demonstration that shut down the airport for several hours further unrest was expected over the weekend after police refused permission for several protests a rally scheduled for friday night called stand with hong kong power to the people will go ahead but the civil human rights front which organised a  million strong march in june was denied permission to hold another through central hong kong on sunday and told it can only rally in a park the personal authority of xi a strongman who has centralised power and extended his mandate indefinitely is at stake the protests come at a particularly sensitive time with the th anniversary of the founding of the communist ruled people s republic of china in october beijing does not want nationwide celebrations planned for that day overshadowed the political cultural and economic clout of the chinese government has been on display as the showdown intensified with major companies and celebrities coming to the defence of hong kong police and authorities the resignation of cathy pacific ceo rupert hogg effective immediately came after mounting scrutiny from both chinese regulators and mainland residents of the role of airline employees in the protest the company  owned by air china has already fired two pilots for taking part in illegal demonstrations and warned others could lose their position if they take part in any illegal activities there is no doubt that our brand and reputation are under immense pressure and this pressure has been growing for some weeks particularly in the all important market of mainland china hogg said in an email to all employees on friday positive displays of support for the hong kong authorities came from major international firms based there including swire and conglomerate jardine matheson which put out a statement saying backed police in efforts to restore law and order martial arts icon jackie chan also sided with authorities describing the demonstrations as sad and depressing the south china morning post reported he also claimed he had not heard about june s  million strong peaceful march chinese american actress liu yifei who stars in the upcoming live action remake of disney s mulan also put out a message on the chinese social media platform weibo saying i also support the hong kong police and sharing a pro beijing image that decision prompted supporters of the hong kong protesters to launch a boycott campaign of the film ,Hong Kong Protests,0.21534422
"In early June, Ivan Ip, 22, joined a public chat group on Telegram called “Parade 69”, named for a mass demonstration planned in central Hong Kong to protest a bill allowing for the transfer of suspects from the city to China. According to Ip, an administrator of the group of more than 30,000 people, they discussed things like bringing sunscreen, water, and umbrellas to block the sun or rain.Two days after the protest, which saw as many as one million Hong Kong residents march against the proposed extradition law, authorities arrived at Ip’s apartment in the evening. Banging on the door, they yelled: “Police! Open up the door!”For the next eight hours, the police, with a warrant for Ip’s arrest on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance, raided his room and questioned him at home and at the police station. After forcing him to unlock his phone and downloading chats from the group, they interrogated him about the group’s creator, the purpose of the forum, and whether Ip knew of other groups for planning “radical actions”.Ip’s arrest is one of several cases that have generated a wave of anxiety among protesters in Hong Kong, thousands of whom have come out to rally against a law they believe spells the end of freedom for their city, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory where residents have long enjoyed freedom of speech and press, and unfettered access to the internet, unlike their peers on the mainland.A protest movement that once capitalised on messaging apps and social media platforms is now seeing those same tools used against it. During pro-democracy protests in 2014, the mostly young, digitally savvy protesters mobilised and organised a two-month shutdown of the city over public platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and through groups on WhatsApp.Now, more protesters are keeping a low profile on social media, communicating only via secure messaging apps, deleting conversations related to the protests, and using pre-paid SIM cards not linked to their personal information. Wary of being tracked, others are disabling location tracking on their phones and buying paper subway tickets rather than using metro cards linked to their IDs.Protesters have been cautioned to always wear face masks, in case photos are used to identify them. Many declined to give out their phone numbers or contacts to reporters, fearing their information could wind up in the hands of police.“It is unprecedented for Hong Kong put such high pressure on freedom of speech. People are getting muted, as the regime wants,” Ip said, describing such methods as a “white terror”.Ip was released on bail around 3am on the morning of 12 June and is currently working with a lawyer on the case. The charge of inciting others to cause a public nuisance carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. The Telegram chat group Ip was in has now been shut down.The methods are reminiscent of mainland China, where citizens can be detained for comments posted on social media and dissidents’ communication is often surveilled.Telegram said on Wednesday it had suffered “powerful” denial of service (DDoS) attacks, originating from China. The platform’s founder, Pavel Durov, said the attacks coincided with the protests in Hong Kong that day.Much of the fear among Hong Kong protesters comes from the arrests of previous leaders of the 2014 protests who were charged with related crimes of inciting public nuisance and sentenced to varying jail terms.“People are very cautious now,” said Billy Li a convener for the Hong Kong Progressive Lawyers Group. “The incitement charge has made people very concerned about whether they can be charged similarly when they say something on the internet.”As a result, the protesters are also changing their language. In an online call, activists invited residents to join a “picnic” in a park the government complex on the evening of 11 June. By the next day, thousands of protesters had surrounded the government.Experts say another concern is what Hong Kong authorities do with the personal data of protesters. The police are equipped with cameras. The biometric data of those arrested is collected. It is not clear how long such data is kept for and for what it is used, according to Craig Choy, a data protection lawyer.Choy warned that another risk is Beijing being given access to the personal data of Hong Kong residents who have participated in the protests. “There is no restriction on cross-border data transfer.

"Two decades ago, many scholars began predicting that as China’s creation of wealth continued to speed ahead, the country would cross a threshold. Once a substantial new middle class had been created, they reasoned, politics would tip decisively in a more participatory, possibly even democratic, direction.But while robust economic growth continued, the first decade of this century came and went with no severe challenge to China’s authoritarian model. And under China’s present leader, Xi Jinping, who took office in 2013, it has only become more entrenched: last year he changed the longstanding rules of succession to allow himself to remain in charge for life.Now, however, this long-expected revolt of the middle class has arrived – not from China itself, but from Hong Kong. And more than any other problem China faces, the ongoing crisis in the city could determine Xi’s standing and his country’s direction over the next few years.A new Hong Kong extradition law is proposed, which would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for a variety of crimes. Residents fear it could lead to politically motivated extraditions into China's much harsher judicial system.Large public demonstrations start as thousands march in the streets to protest against the extradition bill.Hong Kong lawmakers scuffle in parliament during a row over the law.Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences, but critics say they are not enough.The scale of protests continues to increase as more than half a million people take to the streets. Police use rubber bullets and teargas against the biggest protests Hong Kong has seen for decades.Lam says the proposed extradition law has been postponed indefinitely.The protests continue as demonstrators storm the Legislative Council, destroying pictures, daubing graffiti on the walls and flying the old flag of Hong Kong emblazoned with the British union flag. The protests coincide with the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the UK back to China.Armed men in white T-shirts thought to be supporting the Chinese government attack passengers and passers-by in Yuen Long metro station, while nearby police take no action.44 protesters are charged with rioting, which further antagonises the anti-extradition bill movement.By now the protest movement has coalesced around five key demands: complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, withdrawal of the use of the word ""riot"" in relation to the protests, unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped, an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of genuine universal suffrage.The mass protests enter their fifteenth week, with police resorting to teargas and water cannon against the demonstrators, and a wave of ""doxxing"" using digital techniques to unmask police and protesters as a new front in the battle.Police shoot a protester with live ammunition for the first time, as demonstrations continue on the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People's Republic of China.The first charges are brought against protesters for covering their faces, after authorities bring in new laws banning face masks in order to make it easier to identify or detain protesters.Hong Kong officials spark outrage in the city as it revealed that nearly a third of protesters arrested since June have been children. Seven hundred and 50 out of the 2,379 people arrested  were under 18, and 104 were under 16.Lam is forced to deliver a key annual policy speech via video link after after being heckled in parliament, as the legislative council resumed sessions after it was suspended on 12 June. Later in the day one of the protest leaders, Jimmy Sham, was attacked by assailants wielding hammers and knives.Chan Tong-kai, the murder suspect whose case prompted the original extradition bill is released from prison, saying that he is willing to surrender himself to Taiwan. The extradition bill is also formally withdrawn, a key demand of protesters.The problem of open-ended civil unrest in Hong Kong, which has been punctuated by rising acts of violence and vandalism carried out by a distinct but hardline minority, is a reflection of China’s new assertiveness under Xi – an assertiveness that marks a break with the caution of the post-Mao era. It can be seen in Xi’s signature undertaking, the Belt and Road Initiative – an infrastructure building project with global ambitions. Or, most recently, the flaunting of new weapons systems during the military parade commemorating the 70th anniversary of Communist party rule – a declaration of China’s intention to rival American military power more openly than at any time in the recent past.Under Xi, China has been intervening much more directly in the governance of Hong Kong. The most notable example of this was the abduction to China of Hong Kong booksellers who traded in titles critical of Beijing or historical accounts that undermined Chinese orthodoxy. Beijing has also given quiet but clear support to a variety of restrictions on the city’s democracy that have strongly eroded Hong Kong’s sense of generous if limited legal and political autonomy – a notion captured by Beijing’s own slogan for the city’s dispensation, “one country, two systems”.Most notably, these have included the banning of pro-democracy political candidates and the proposal in February by Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, of the measure that sparked the ongoing protests: a law that would allow for the extradition of criminal suspects from Hong Kong to mainland China. Public approval of Lam has plummeted since then, and her position hasn’t been helped by her acknowledgment that many of her options are determined by Beijing. This has effectively meant refusing concessions on the protesters’ main demands – such as for direct election of the city’s leaders and an independent investigation of violent abuses by the police – and only recently grudgingly offering to formally withdraw the extradition proposal. Notably, she has also said that Beijing will not allow her to step down, another of the demonstrators’ key demands.This blocking of any path forward that would permit more self-determination under Chinese sovereignty – as promised when Britain handed Hong Kong back to the mainland in 1997 – has led to a marked radicalisation of Hong Kong’s population this year, and created a revolt of the middle class. The peaceful demonstrations that have regularly drawn hundreds of thousands of residents into the streets since the summer have included many older people, as well as plenty of residents from other segments of the population long assumed to be conservative or at least acquiescent, whether civil servants or business people.The situation might have unfolded far more gently had the city been handled with more suppleness or tolerance. But the central logic of power under Xi’s leadership has always been to push for more control, both domestically and within the region. The drive to impose tighter reins on Hong Kong now risks all kinds of unwanted damage. This only begins with the radicalisation of the Hong Kong population, and harm to the city’s economy and reputation as a dependable business mecca.Just in the past fortnight, the effects of the crisis in Hong Kong spread in an unanticipated way to the US. When an executive for an NBA team expressed support on Twitter for the Hong Kong protesters, Chinese companies immediately cut their ties to the American basketball league in lockstep. In a country where most people know little about China, this was the first time that many became aware of the lengths to which Beijing will go to censor speech and impose conformity.From here, Beijing’s choices in Hong Kong will not grow easier. The ultimate option, of course, is to mount a police or military intervention from the mainland in order to put down the protests. But at what cost? Hong Kong would lose forever its status as a global, cosmopolitan city, a goose that lays golden eggs for China. Since Deng Xiaoping introduced capitalism to China, Hong Kong has served as a critical business and investment portal for the country: a place where foreign companies feel it is safer for them to be based because of the independent judicial system and a banking structure that allows the free conversion of currencies and unlimited international transfers. As China has grown vastly richer it has become less dependent on Hong Kong for such purposes, but lots of investment into China still passes through the city.A takeover of Hong Kong by force would also destroy Beijing’s proposition – tattered as it may already be – that Taiwan should accept unification with China on the basis of one country, two systems. Recent events in Hong Kong have already strongly lifted the election prospects for the governing party in Taiwan, whose leader Tsai Ing-wen favours continued defiance of Beijing.Most unpredictable, though, is how this will play in China itself. A catastrophic crackdown in Hong Kong could go very badly for Xi, a leader who has tried to project an aura of resolve and near infallibility. Today Beijing trumpets that its 1.4 billion people stand united in their opposition to Hong Kong’s democracy movement. But that is a claim only sustainable in an environment of suffocating media control in China.If mass arrests or tanks were used to crush a protest movement aimed at securing democratic concessions, members of China’s own large and growing middle class would begin to see this not just as a defeat for Hong Kong, but as a loss for their own society as well.• Howard W French is an academic and author.

"Joshua Wong was serving a prison sentence for his role in the 2014 “umbrella movement” when Hong Kong’s current protests broke out.He said: “Agnes [Chow] visited me and said: ‘You know, on 17 June, when you are released, I guess the extradition bill will already have passed. In fact, 2 million people went on the street.”The unprecedented outpouring of public anger had already forced Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive, to announce that the bill was dead – and has kept the protests going. But as the movement enters its 13th weekend, Wong and Chow are among hundreds who have been arrested over the unrest.In an interview conducted before his arrest, the secretary general of pro-democracy group Demosistō said no one could have imagined such large-scale and enduring turmoil.He said: “They cannot govern Hong Kong any more. Five years ago, we said youngsters were standing on the frontlines and parents were criticising them. But baby boomers have been very supportive this time. People might not agree with all the behaviour of the protesters, but everyone is asking what’s the reason for teargas in residential areas, in roads where there aren’t even protesters?”He pointed to a poll showing that about four-fifths of the population want an independent inquiry into the police response to unrest – a key demand of the movement – and that almost as many want the government to completely withdraw the bill.He said: “Never in Hong Kong history have you had people supporting a political demand like that.”Wong said that while low wages and cramped housing had played a part in fomenting discontent, they were not driving the protests, with many professionals and wealthier people taking part, too. He said: “Everyone knows Hong Kong people are just asking for fundamental rights enjoyed by western countries since the last century.”Wong was a student leader who became the face of the 2014 movement and co-founded Demosistō. This time the protests are leaderless and he is just one face among many. Participants make their own decisions on the streets or via online voting.But arresting him and Chow, another leading figure in Demosistō, is a gamble. Protesters may well be intimidated by the cumulative effect of arrests, sackings and attacks by thugs. But many of the previous attempts to turn up the pressure have created further anger, and sustained mass participation.Wong said: “Mistakes by the riot police and Hong Kong government encourage people to continue this movement.”Protesters are under no illusions about the likelihood of retaliation once the movement is over, given what happened after 2014.Wong said: “One country, two systems [China’s formula for ruling Hong Kong after Britain returned the city to Beijing in 1997] was eroded [systematically] after the umbrella movement: there were jailings, the disqualification of legislative council members, the booksellers were kidnapped, a foreign correspondent’s visa was not renewed … If we don’t continue, the crackdown will be far worse than you can imagine.”Many believe authorities will crack down far more harshly if there is no sign of the movement dwindling. Mainland media have shown paramilitary police drills near the border with Hong Kong and there is growing talk that the government might invoke the emergency regulations ordinance, a colonial-era giving sweeping powers to the chief executive on everything from censorship to arrest and property seizures.Wong said: “I can’t imagine what would be the outcome. Of course they’re trying to scare people. But I think it also scares the world.“World leaders may not care about the extradition bill or whether Hong Kong people have the right to vote. But the idea of troops in the CBD [central business district] – that’s what they worry about.“It would have an impact on the global economy. Just imagine the internet being shut down – how could financial markets operate smoothly? Even the [pro-establishment] tycoons will urge Carrie Lam not to use this ordinance. Political freedom for Hong Kong depends on Beijing. But the economy [also] depends on western countries.”He said he believed that international opinion was shifting, citing the recent joint statement from the G7 on Hong Kong, remarks from the UK’s foreign affairs select committee and growing political support among US politicians.Wong said: “People ask, how can we succeed? Someone told me the state would win. They’ve won for the last 22 years [since the handover] already, and especially in the last five years. We have nothing to lose.”",Joshua Wong predicted Hong Kong crackdown in interview before arrest,2019-08-30/08:35:26,joshua wong was serving a prison sentence for his role in the  umbrella movement when hong kong s current protests broke out he said agnes chow visited me and said you know on  june when you are released i guess the extradition bill will already have passed in fact  million people went on the street the unprecedented outpouring of public anger had already forced carrie lam the city s chief executive to announce that the bill was dead and has kept the protests going but as the movement enters its th weekend wong and chow are among hundreds who have been arrested over the unrest in an interview conducted before his arrest the secretary general of pro democracy group demosistō said no one could have imagined such large scale and enduring turmoil he said they cannot govern hong kong any more five years ago we said youngsters were standing on the frontlines and parents were criticising them but baby boomers have been very supportive this time people might not agree with all the behaviour of the protesters but everyone is asking what s the reason for teargas in residential areas in roads where there aren t even protesters he pointed to a poll showing that about four fifths of the population want an independent inquiry into the police response to unrest a key demand of the movement and that almost as many want the government to completely withdraw the bill he said never in hong kong history have you had people supporting a political demand like that wong said that while low wages and cramped housing had played a part in fomenting discontent they were not driving the protests with many professionals and wealthier people taking part too he said everyone knows hong kong people are just asking for fundamental rights enjoyed by western countries since the last century wong was a student leader who became the face of the  movement and co founded demosistō this time the protests are leaderless and he is just one face among many participants make their own decisions on the streets or via online voting but arresting him and chow another leading figure in demosistō is a gamble protesters may well be intimidated by the cumulative effect of arrests sackings and attacks by thugs but many of the previous attempts to turn up the pressure have created further anger and sustained mass participation wong said mistakes by the riot police and hong kong government encourage people to continue this movement protesters are under no illusions about the likelihood of retaliation once the movement is over given what happened after  wong said one country two systems china s formula for ruling hong kong after britain returned the city to beijing in  was eroded systematically after the umbrella movement there were jailings the disqualification of legislative council members the booksellers were kidnapped a foreign correspondent s visa was not renewed if we don t continue the crackdown will be far worse than you can imagine many believe authorities will crack down far more harshly if there is no sign of the movement dwindling mainland media have shown paramilitary police drills near the border with hong kong and there is growing talk that the government might invoke the emergency regulations ordinance a colonial era giving sweeping powers to the chief executive on everything from censorship to arrest and property seizures wong said i can t imagine what would be the outcome of course they re trying to scare people but i think it also scares the world world leaders may not care about the extradition bill or whether hong kong people have the right to vote but the idea of troops in the cbd central business district that s what they worry about it would have an impact on the global economy just imagine the internet being shut down how could financial markets operate smoothly even the pro establishment tycoons will urge carrie lam not to use this ordinance political freedom for hong kong depends on beijing but the economy also depends on western countries he said he believed that international opinion was shifting citing the recent joint statement from the g on hong kong remarks from the uk s foreign affairs select committee and growing political support among us politicians wong said people ask how can we succeed someone told me the state would win they ve won for the last  years since the handover already and especially in the last five years we have nothing to lose ,Hong Kong Protests,0.214398548
"Recent scenes from Hong Kong might have come from an 1980s gangster film, with hundreds of white-shirted triad members rampaging through subway trains brutally beating all in their path with bamboo poles and metal rods.Yet this was no movie. The police were mysteriously absent and emergency services didn’t answer the 24,000 phone calls seeking help. By the end of last Sunday night, 45 people were in hospital.The absence of authority reflects the disappearance of governance during this political crisis, which has allowed a spiral to pick up speed, shattering confidence in all that Hong Kong holds dear.Within the space of two months, Hong Kong has remade itself into something profoundly discombobulating for its residents. Its civil service, once feted for its neutrality and professionalism, has been left floundering and riven by dissent, as hundreds of civil servants threaten industrial action if the administration continues to ignore demands to withdraw the controversial extradition bill that sparked the crisis. The judiciary, once considered neutral and impartial, has been handing down sentences that call its independence into question. The police force, once touted as Asia’s finest, is widely hated, while Hong Kong’s reputation as the world’s safest city has been undermined.The transport system, a model of speed and efficiency, has become the latest theatre of civil disobedience, with protesters pulling the emergency handles on subway trains in protest at the lack of protection from the operator on the night of the attacks. Aviation workers occupied the city’s airport on a wildcat sit-in to spread their message to incoming visitors.Even the ancient practice of ancestor worship has been touched by this crisis, with the controversial pro-Beijing legislator Junius Ho, who was caught on camera shaking hands with white-shirted thugs the night they ran amok, complaining that his parents’ graves had been defaced with political slogans.It is as if Hong Kong has come unmoored and the unspoken social contracts that govern life no longer hold true. The unanchoring of this city is reflected in a mass mental health crisis for residents thrown into this sudden new reality. The fallout is eroding the very institutions that distinguish Hong Kong from mainland China. So how did things unravel so quickly in one of the world’s most cosmopolitan, most orderly, most law-abiding cities?The eye of the storm is the still, silent centre of an administration that has withdrawn into itself, refusing public dialogue with protesters or students. Its initial mistake – which kicked off the firestorm of protests – was attempting to ram through legislation that would allow Beijing to extradite anyone accused of a serious criminal offence to face trial in China. In an attempt to expedite the process, the government shrank the consultation period and ignored the correct legislative process, sparking massive public outrage. After more than a million people attended the first round of marches, the Hong Kong government has seemed to disappear from view.The inaction of the administration has left the police, normally the agency of last resort, as the only public interface between the authorities and those they govern. That “contact” has increasingly taken the form of teargas, rubber bullets and bean bags fired at the people, as a hard core of radical protesters have stayed on after peaceful marches have dispersed, occupying streets and besieging government offices. On 1 July, they even stormed Hong Kong’s legislative council, desecrating emblems linked to China. A recent survey shows that more than 80% of marchers are sympathetic to such actions, indicating widespread radicalisation. In a rare move, the police banned one march, increasing fears that the city’s cherished freedoms are under threat.Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has said that the offending extradition bill is “dead”, but is refusing to declare that it has been withdrawn. When Lam has emerged, she has unsettled politically attuned Hongkongers. She has been seen flanked by police, praising police actions or visiting injured policemen in hospital. She has not, as yet, visited any ordinary citizens injured by the gang members. Her stiff, defensive, clearly choreographed appearances increasingly ape mainland China’s political culture.Lam’s language has also raised hackles in Hong Kong, by blatantly adopting the political rhetoric of the mainland. After protesters defaced the national emblem of Beijing’s representative office in Hong Kong, she accused them of “hurting the feelings” of 1.4 billion Chinese people and of challenging Beijing’s sovereignty. Such phrases are completely alien to the political lexicon of Hong Kong. More predictably, Beijing has been shrill, angrily blaming “foreign forces” for the unrest and issuing veiled threats that the People’s Liberation Army could be called in to restore order.The breakdown in governance has undermined the administration’s performance legitimacy, while Hongkongers, through their acts of civil disobedience, have shown they are withdrawing their consent to be governed. In truth, that consent was always resting on the promise of future political reform and the well-worn mantra of “one country, two systems”. But the past 22 years under Chinese rule have shown that this formula was never an equation: one country always took precedence over two systems.As the Hong Kong government barricades itself in, pro-Beijing forces have filled the leadership gap with violence: the lawlessness of the thugs, the institutionalised violence of the police force. This has fuelled a weekend insurgency among a very small number of radical protesters, whose methods are increasingly supported by desperate and disenchanted peaceful demonstrators.In the absence of dialogue, violence is the only conversation between the two sides and every weekend the stakes are ratcheted higher. Nobody can predict what Hong Kong will look like at the end of the summer. What is certain, though, is that the city can no longer return to the way it once was.• Louisa Lim is an author and a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne.

subway trains in protest at the lack of protection from the operator on the night of the attacks aviation workers occupied the city s airport on a wildcat sit in to spread their message to incoming visitors even the ancient practice of ancestor worship has been touched by this crisis with the controversial pro beijing legislator junius ho who was caught on camera shaking hands with white shirted thugs the night they ran amok complaining that his parents graves had been defaced with political slogans it is as if hong kong has come unmoored and the unspoken social contracts that govern life no longer hold true the unanchoring of this city is reflected in a mass mental health crisis for residents thrown into this sudden new reality the fallout is eroding the very institutions that distinguish hong kong from mainland china so how did things unravel so quickly in one of the world s most cosmopolitan most orderly most law abiding cities the eye of the storm is the still silent centre of an administration that has withdrawn into itself refusing public dialogue with protesters or students its initial mistake which kicked off the firestorm of protests was attempting to ram through legislation that would allow beijing to extradite anyone accused of a serious criminal offence to face trial in china in an attempt to expedite the process the government shrank the consultation period and ignored the correct legislative process sparking massive public outrage after more than a million people attended the first round of marches the hong kong government has seemed to disappear from view the inaction of the administration has left the police normally the agency of last resort as the only public interface between the authorities and those they govern that contact has increasingly taken the form of teargas rubber bullets and bean bags fired at the people as a hard core of radical protesters have stayed on after peaceful marches have dispersed occupying streets and besieging government offices on  july they even stormed hong kong s legislative council desecrating emblems linked to china a recent survey shows that more than  of marchers are sympathetic to such actions indicating widespread radicalisation in a rare move the police banned one march increasing fears that the city s cherished freedoms are under threat hong kong s chief executive carrie lam has said that the offending extradition bill is dead but is refusing to declare that it has been withdrawn when lam has emerged she has unsettled politically attuned hongkongers she has been seen flanked by police praising police actions or visiting injured policemen in hospital she has not as yet visited any ordinary citizens injured by the gang members her stiff defensive clearly choreographed appearances increasingly ape mainland china s political culture lam s language has also raised hackles in hong kong by blatantly adopting the political rhetoric of the mainland after protesters defaced the national emblem of beijing s representative office in hong kong she accused them of hurting the feelings of   billion chinese people and of challenging beijing s sovereignty such phrases are completely alien to the political lexicon of hong kong more predictably beijing has been shrill angrily blaming foreign forces for the unrest and issuing veiled threats that the people s liberation army could be called in to restore order the breakdown in governance has undermined the administration s performance legitimacy while hongkongers through their acts of civil disobedience have shown they are withdrawing their consent to be governed in truth that consent was always resting on the promise of future political reform and the well worn mantra of one country two systems but the past  years under chinese rule have shown that this formula was never an equation one country always took precedence over two systems as the hong kong government barricades itself in pro beijing forces have filled the leadership gap with violence the lawlessness of the thugs the institutionalised violence of the police force this has fuelled a weekend insurgency among a very small number of radical protesters whose methods are increasingly supported by desperate and disenchanted peaceful demonstrators in the absence of dialogue violence is the only conversation between the two sides and every weekend the stakes are ratcheted higher nobody can predict what hong kong will look like at the end of the summer what is certain though is that the city can no longer return to the

"Staff at a small NGO in southern China with links to Hong Kong have been arrested on suspicion of state subversion, as authorities crack down on mainland activists with any possible connections to the protests.On Monday, lawyers for the three staff members of Changsha Funeng, a public welfare organisation focusing especially on disability rights, said the three had been formally arrested on suspicion of state subversion.The charge is unusually severe for a group that does not work on overtly political or sensitive issues. Changsha Funeng, a three-person large NGO founded in 2016, describes itself as a “public welfare organisation” advocating for the rights of vulnerable groups and government accountability through disclosure requests.“It has nothing to do with subverting the government and subverting the political system,” the organisation said in a statement.In July, police detained the “Changsha Three” as the group is now known. On 22 July, police stormed the home of Cheng Yuan, co-founder of the NGO, in Shenzhen. Cheng’s wife was taken to a neighbourhood committee office with a black hood over her head to face interrogation. The other two were arrested at their homes in Changsha.According to co-founder Yang Zhanqing, now in the US, the group had set up a company in Hong Kong through which it received funds from overseas. Cheng Yuan, who lived in Shenzhen near China’s border with Hong Kong, regularly traveled to Hong Kong for meetings related to the NGO’s work.Yang said the group was not affiliated with the protests. On Twitter, Liu Yongze, one of the arrested staffers, retweeted a BBC article about the protests and a comment by another user that read: “Hong Kong people can only fight.” According to Yang, there was no indication the other two were in support of the protests.Yang said the primary reason for the arrest appears to be the group’s funding, which he said did not violate any laws, but the Hong Kong protests may be another major factor.“Hong Kong and the anti-extradition movement has had a great impact on the mainland, so there is tighter control on mainland. It’s possible they are arresting people more quickly and putting them under more severe charges,” he said.The protests, started in June over a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China, have garnered support in some corners of China among liberal pockets of activists, intellectuals, and regular citizens.Several Chinese activists have been interrogated or detained for expressing support of the protests on social media. A dissident based in the southern province of Guangdong who attended the demonstrations in August was detained for 15 days when he returned. A Wechat user in Shandong province was also reportedly criminally detained for expressing his support of the protesters in Hong Kong in a Wechat group.“I feel any activists or civil society groups who have somewhat foreign connects are in a dangerous situation,” said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher for Human Rights Watch.Rights advocates say the space for civil society in China has shrunk dramatically under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who came to power in 2012. Groups that would previously not have been deemed sensitive have been shuttered.“It’s clear the real motivation is to crack down on independent civil society and rights advocacy,” said Wang. “The prosecutions show that rights advocacy NGOs in China are on the verge of total elimination.”",Staff of NGO linked to Hong Kong arrested in southern China,2019-08-29/09:56:56,staff at a small ngo in southern china with links to hong kong have been arrested on suspicion of state subversion as authorities crack down on mainland activists with any possible connections to the protests on monday lawyers for the three staff members of changsha funeng a public welfare organisation focusing especially on disability rights said the three had been formally arrested on suspicion of state subversion the charge is unusually severe for a group that does not work on overtly political or sensitive issues changsha funeng a three person large ngo founded in  describes itself as a public welfare organisation advocating for the rights of vulnerable groups and government accountability through disclosure requests it has nothing to do with subverting the government and subverting the political system the organisation said in a statement in july police detained the changsha three as the group is now known on  july police stormed the home of cheng yuan co founder of the ngo in shenzhen cheng s wife was taken to a neighbourhood committee office with a black hood over her head to face interrogation the other two were arrested at their homes in changsha according to co founder yang zhanqing now in the us the group had set up a company in hong kong through which it received funds from overseas cheng yuan who lived in shenzhen near china s border with hong kong regularly traveled to hong kong for meetings related to the ngo s work yang said the group was not affiliated with the protests on twitter liu yongze one of the arrested staffers retweeted a bbc article about the protests and a comment by another user that read hong kong people can only fight according to yang there was no indication the other two were in support of the protests yang said the primary reason for the arrest appears to be the group s funding which he said did not violate any laws but the hong kong protests may be another major factor hong kong and the anti extradition movement has had a great impact on the mainland so there is tighter control on mainland it s possible they are arresting people more quickly and putting them under more severe charges he said the protests started in june over a bill that would allow extradition to mainland china have garnered support in some corners of china among liberal pockets of activists intellectuals and regular citizens several chinese activists have been interrogated or detained for expressing support of the protests on social media a dissident based in the southern province of guangdong who attended the demonstrations in august was detained for  days when he returned a wechat user in shandong province was also reportedly criminally detained for expressing his support of the protesters in hong kong in a wechat group i feel any activists or civil society groups who have somewhat foreign connects are in a dangerous situation said yaqiu wang china researcher for human rights watch rights advocates say the space for civil society in china has shrunk dramatically under the leadership of xi jinping who came to power in  groups that would previously not have been deemed sensitive have been shuttered it s clear the real motivation is to crack down on independent civil society and rights advocacy said wang the prosecutions show that rights advocacy ngos in china are on the verge of total elimination ,Hong Kong Protests,0.209931493
"The decision by the Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, to withdraw the extradition bill that provoked months of turmoil represents a major and unexpected concession from Beijing, but is almost certainly too little, and too late, to end the protests.In June when millions first poured into the streets in peaceful protest, a promise to  ditch the  law might well have muted the burgeoning popular uprising. But Lam is only acting after months of police brutality, thug attacks on protesters, mass arrests, and barely veiled threats of security intervention from mainland China.“This is a government which has backed police abuses, threatened to use unlimited emergency powers, banned peaceful assemblies and arrested more than 1,000 protesters,” said Kenneth Chan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and former lawmaker. “Having gone through all this, few could thank Carrie Lam today.”Over the last three months, a movement born out of concerns over one law has morphed into something much broader. Demonstrators have drawn up a list of five key demands, including a public inquiry into police violence, amnesty for arrested protesters and democratic reforms to bring universal suffrage.Many protesters saw Beijing’s concession as meeting only the “easiest and ‘cheapest’” of their five demands, said Lokman Tsui, an assistant professor at the journalism school of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.“In the last few weeks the bill hasn’t been on most protesters’ minds, actually,” he said. “Instead it’s the government’s response to the protests, the way they tried to silence and suppress the protesters – by using teargas, inappropriate levels of force, arresting people for protesting etc – that is at the heart of the ongoing protests.”The law would have allowed any resident or visitor to Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China to face trial in opaque, politically controlled courts, in effect destroying the legal firewall that underpins Hong Kong’s economy and its political freedoms.It spurred unprecedented protests because many in the city, including those who normally steered clear of politics, saw it as an existential threat to both their livelihoods and way of life.The decision to drop it is certain to have been sanctioned by Beijing, which is balancing a desire not to look weak, and a fear that concessions will only embolden protesters, with concern over the political and economic toll of the protests.Hong Kong is deeply embedded in the southern Chinese economy, and is an important portal to international financial markets for the whole country. The turmoil has also come as the trade war between China and the US deepens.News of Lam’s announcement revived the city’s main Hang Seng index, and demonstrators were quick to capitalise on market enthusiasm for the concession with memes such as one that asked: “Did you know? If you respond to one demand, the Hang Seng index will rise a thousand points. Respond to five demands, the Hang Seng index will rise five thousand points.”The stakes are getting higher for both authorities and protesters as 1 October approaches, the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China. Lavish national celebrations have been planned to mark the date, and the president, Xi Jinping, is unlikely to want them overshadowed by unrest in Hong Kong.Demonstrators have not been deterred by police violence, mass arrests or threats of greater use of force, and so the decision to withdraw the bill may have been a first attempt at compromise. But there are also fears that Beijing may just be paving the way for the use of force, by allowing Chinese authorities to claim they tried and failed to compromise.“My worry is that what she did is part of Beijing’s blueprint to prepare a heavy crackdown,” said Chan. “The state propaganda officials have on numerous occasions argued that the movement ‘is no longer about the law, its subversive and anti-China’.”","Beijing's Hong Kong compromise is surely too little, too late",2019-09-04/18:52:53,the decision by the hong kong leader carrie lam to withdraw the extradition bill that provoked months of turmoil represents a major and unexpected concession from beijing but is almost certainly too little and too late to end the protests in june when millions first poured into the streets in peaceful protest a promise to ditch the law might well have muted the burgeoning popular uprising but lam is only acting after months of police brutality thug attacks on protesters mass arrests and barely veiled threats of security intervention from mainland china this is a government which has backed police abuses threatened to use unlimited emergency powers banned peaceful assemblies and arrested more than   protesters said kenneth chan a professor at hong kong baptist university and former lawmaker having gone through all this few could thank carrie lam today over the last three months a movement born out of concerns over one law has morphed into something much broader demonstrators have drawn up a list of five key demands including a public inquiry into police violence amnesty for arrested protesters and democratic reforms to bring universal suffrage many protesters saw beijing s concession as meeting only the easiest and cheapest of their five demands said lokman tsui an assistant professor at the journalism school of the chinese university of hong kong in the last few weeks the bill hasn t been on most protesters minds actually he said instead it s the government s response to the protests the way they tried to silence and suppress the protesters by using teargas inappropriate levels of force arresting people for protesting etc that is at the heart of the ongoing protests the law would have allowed any resident or visitor to hong kong to be sent to mainland china to face trial in opaque politically controlled courts in effect destroying the legal firewall that underpins hong kong s economy and its political freedoms it spurred unprecedented protests because many in the city including those who normally steered clear of politics saw it as an existential threat to both their livelihoods and way of life the decision to drop it is certain to have been sanctioned by beijing which is balancing a desire not to look weak and a fear that concessions will only embolden protesters with concern over the political and economic toll of the protests hong kong is deeply embedded in the southern chinese economy and is an important portal to international financial markets for the whole country the turmoil has also come as the trade war between china and the us deepens news of lam s announcement revived the city s main hang seng index and demonstrators were quick to capitalise on market enthusiasm for the concession with memes such as one that asked did you know if you respond to one demand the hang seng index will rise a thousand points respond to five demands the hang seng index will rise five thousand points the stakes are getting higher for both authorities and protesters as  october approaches the th anniversary of the founding of communist china lavish national celebrations have been planned to mark the date and the president xi jinping is unlikely to want them overshadowed by unrest in hong kong demonstrators have not been deterred by police violence mass arrests or threats of greater use of force and so the decision to withdraw the bill may have been a first attempt at compromise but there are also fears that beijing may just be paving the way for the use of force by allowing chinese authorities to claim they tried and failed to compromise my worry is that what she did is part of beijing s blueprint to prepare a heavy crackdown said chan the state propaganda officials have on numerous occasions argued that the movement is no longer about the law its subversive and anti china ,Hong Kong Protests,0.207983106
"The invocation of a draconian law to quell a four-month unrest in Hong Kong has signalled the start of an authoritarian era that will plunge the city in a worse crisis, analysts and Hong Kongers have said.The Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, announced on Friday that the government had invoked the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to pass a regulation forbidding the use of face masks. The decision bypassed the legislature, which resumes sessions in mid-October.Lam said the move was designed to stop violence and restore calm, but the government was prepared for immediate protests and a weekend of escalating violence: government employees were sent home early, schools were closed early on Friday and all school activities were cancelled on Saturday. Many shopping malls, banks and businesses were also closed.Thousands thronged on to the streets after Lam made the announcement on Friday afternoon. After dark, crowds lit fires at two metro stations and vandalised shops and businesses regarded as being pro-China. Police threw teargas and an off-duty officer reportedly fired a live round, hitting a 14-year-old boy in the thigh, after protesters attacked him.Political analysts said the use of the emergency law signalled the start of authoritarian rule in the semi-autonomous city.Hong Kong has had civil freedoms under China’s one country, two system policy since 1997. Although many have been eroded over the years, the emergency regulations were expected quickly eradicate many fundamental rights.“This symbolises very much the beginning of authoritarianism,” said Joseph Cheng, a retired political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong. “The Pandora’s box is opened. This law gives the government widespread power to do anything it likes. There is no more check and balance.“Suppression has begun, and there are no more considerations for reconciliation,” he said.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongThe ordinance, created by the colonial British government to break up port strikes in 1922, was last used in 1967 to quell pro-communist riots. It grants the city’s leader sweeping powers to “make any regulations” he or she may consider to be in the public interest in situations considered “an occasion of emergency or public danger”.The regulations empower the government to impose a series of draconian measures, including censorship, control and suppression of publications and other means of communications, arrest, detention and deportation as well as the freezing of assets, the authorisation of the entry and search of premises, and the taking of possession or control of any property.“Now the government has set the precedent of legislating by decree, more could come and it is a slippery slope,” said Ho-fung Hung, a professor of political economy at the Johns Hopkins University in the US.“Investors’ confidence in Hong Kong’s rule of law and freedom of speech, the two cornerstones of Hong Kong’s status as a global financial hub, are in jeopardy.”Lam threatened to implement harsher measures if the protests continued. Police groups have called for a citywide curfew, and there have been talks about delaying district elections planned for November.Many Hongkongers fear the government could use the emergency provisions to force through unpopular proposed laws and policies, such as a subversion law that was suspended in 2003 after a mass protest, a national anthem law and the criminalisation of insults against the police.“Hong Kong has become a dictatorial government. Now the floodgate is open, they can do what they like with the infinite power they have,” said an 18-year-old school leaver who wore a black face mask in protest at Lam’s announcement. “Like at a buffet, she picked the mask ban this time, and she is free to pick two or three more later as she wishes.”Apart from mandating schools to close, the government closed public culture and leisure facilities on Saturday and ordered teachers to ask parents to ensure their children refrained from wearing face masks at school. Many students, mostly in secondary schools, have worn medical masks while staging anti-government protests outside their schools.All the metro train services remained suspended for most of Saturday, after being closed late on Friday.Jean-Philippe Béja, a research emeritus professor at the centre for international studies and research at Sciences-Po in Paris, said the government was trying to “scare people with an atmosphere of war” and “many people will see this as a provocation”.Analysts said the emergency measure risked fuelling an even more violent and widespread resistance. “It is an attempt to extinguish a fire with gasoline,” Ho said. “It will only make protesters more determined and militant.”One protester, who has been demonstrating since June, said: “I would keep coming out and I would keep wearing a mask. I’m angry and also sad, because the government has declared war on the people.”Another protester, who refused to be identified, said further draconian measures, such as a curfew, sending in the Chinese army and taking control of communications, were all within his expectations. However, he insisted the militant protesters would be ready for any such moves as part of their “scorched earth” strategy.“If we burn, we burn together.

"Disney’s live-action remake of Mulan is facing calls for a boycott after its star voiced support for police in Hong Kong.Crystal Liu, also known as Liu Yifei, reportedly posted a message on the Chinese social media site Weibo, which translated as: “I also support Hong Kong police. You can beat me up now.” In English, the post added: “What a shame for Hong Kong.”Though Twitter and many other social media sites are censored within China, the comments provoked fierce criticism elsewhere and the hashtag BoycottMulan began trending.Liu’s comments were an apparent reference to chants heard by pro-police activists demonstrating in support of a journalist who was beaten by pro-democracy protesters. A T-shirt bearing the slogan “I love HK police” was reportedly found in a bag belonging to Fu Guohao, a journalist from the Chinese state newspaper the Global Times.Police have meted out violence against pro-democracy demonstrators during heightened tensions in the former British colony.The protests were originally sparked by controversial extradition proposals from the Hong Kong government in June which would have allowed some suspects to be sent to mainland China for trials. That led to fears of Hong Kong’s independent legal system being bypassed, with people being pulled into China’s legal system which can involve televised confessions and a lack of judicial safeguards.The government suspended the planned legislation but protesters have pressed on with broader calls for it to be scrapped entirely, along with demands for democratic reforms.Following Liu’s social media post, critics accused the naturalised US citizen of supporting police brutality and denying Hong Kong citizens the rights she enjoyed in her adopted country.She is not the only star who has been criticised for their stance on the protests. The martial artist Jackie Chan, who was born in Hong Kong, has been accused of failing to support pro-democracy protesters. He reportedly told China’s state broadcaster CCTV that the events were “sad and depressing”, adding: “I have visited many countries and I can say our country has been rapidly developing in recent years. I feel pride in being Chinese wherever I go and the ‘five-starred Red Flag’ is respected everywhere around the world.”Disney has been contacted for comment.

"Donald Trump has urged Beijing to treat Hong Kong “humanely” in order to reach a trade deal, in his most extensive comments yet on weeks of increasingly violent unrest in the territory.“Millions of jobs are being lost in China to other non-Tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. Of course China wants to make a deal.

But as the mass protests enter their third month, the warnings from Beijing have grown more trenchant and officials have hinted that military intervention is possible.Chinese officials have described the protests in Hong Kong, which have devolved into frequent clashes between protesters, residents, and the police, as “terrorism” and an effort to topple the government.On Thursday, the People’s Daily, the official voice of the ruling Chinese communist party ran a front-page article criticising protesters who seized a state media reporter during tense confrontations at the Hong Kong airport this week.“What they really want to is to fight against Hong Kong and engage in a “colour revolution,” read the article, among the first to appear on the paper’s front page. The editorial warned the “black hands” behind the protests that “1.4 billion Chinese people are united and will stop any damage to the country and its people.

On Wednesday evening, demonstrators burned joss paper and pointed lasers at a police station in Sham Shui Po in Kowloon, prompting the police to fire teargas in the residential area.Demonstrations by teachers, pet owners, and public transport workers were planned through the rest of the week as well as a large march on Sunday.Protesters have staged 10 weeks of relentless marches and demonstrations to demand greater freedoms in Hong Kong, including rallies that paralysed the semi-autonomous city’s airport, one of the world’s busiest travel hubs.Beijing has accused western countries, in particular the US, for instigating the protests.

"How far will China go to end Hong Kong’s unrest, now in its 13th week and still growing? Senior officials have spoken not only of “terrorist acts” but of “colour revolution characteristics”, making it clear that they have ruled out compromise.So far they have relied on the Hong Kong government to suppress the protests, but the banning of rallies, brutal police tactics, thug attacks, the arrests of high-profile activists and metro line closures have failed to dampen the unrest. On Sunday, thousands of activists descended on the airport.“They are trying very hard to scare people off the streets. It has only made people angrier,” said Ho-fung Hung of Johns Hopkins University, whose research areas include protest in China.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongThat has stirred fears that the authorities will resort to more extreme measures as 1 October approaches. Many see the date as Beijing’s deadline for ending the unrest, believing it would not tolerate anything overshadowing nationwide celebrations for the 70th anniversary of Communist rule in China.Memories of 1989’s crackdown on Tiananmen Square’s pro-reform movement shadow the current unrest, raising the question of how far authorities will go to crush the challenge.Margaret Ng, a pro-democracy activist former legislator, said that protesters were very aware of the risks. “Going forward may put them in the fire, but stopping is not going to save them.,” she said.For Beijing, “the question is whether they want to destroy Hong Kong. If they interfere directly it spells the end of one country, two systems”.Jean-Pierre Cabestan, an expert on Chinese politics at Hong Kong Baptist University, said that this arrangement – which is supposed to guarantee the region a high degree of autonomy – is useful to Beijing too.But he added: “It’s hard for the Communist party not to be tempted to interfere. It’s a political organisation, not just about management. On the one hand they are overconfident and on the other they are paranoid. They want to prevent Hong Kong becoming a base for subversion, and that trumps everything.”The Hong Kong government has hinted that it may invoke the emergency regulations ordinance which hands wide powers to the chief executive. Some fear it could be used to shut down the internet or allow mass detentions over 1 October to prevent protests that day.Officials and pro-establishment politicians have suggested limited uses of emergency powers, such as banning masks or targeting sites or platforms the activists use.Simon Young, a professor of law at the University of Hong Kong, noted that some restraints also remained on the executive. Courts can issue injunctions to halt measures and the legislative council can amend regulations, but it is in recess and not due to sit again until October. It is also stacked in Beijing’s favour.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. Opponents say using legislation designed to suspend basic rights is inherently drastic and would end Hong Kong’s status as Asia’s premier financial centre. Limited measures would also probably escalate.“The ordinance is not an across-the-board declaration of martial law. It’s piecemeal, as required, but with very sweeping powers,” said Steve Tsang, the director of the Soas China institute.“Once you invoke it you have crossed a threshold and it is far harder for the government to exercise self-restraint … I think they see it as a way to avoid sending in troops without realising that it will finally result in the People’s Liberation Army [PLA] and People’s Armed Police [PAP] coming in.”The region’s Basic Law allows the Hong Kong government to request the help of the PLA garrison in the city. Troops arrived across the border this week, though state media said it was a regular rotation.Some wonder if soldiers might initially be used to guard buildings such as the Central Liaison Office, with the justification that they are central government institutions and Hong Kong police are overstretched.The paramilitary police, also part of the armed forces, would be a more obvious choice because their job is domestic security. State media have covered their recent drills near the border heavily, but because they are not stationed in Hong Kong their use would require a national-level order saying that national laws applied, Young said.That would leave one country, two systems dead in the water, and might not end unrest. There is growing talk of the “Northern Irelandisation” of the city, a long-term troop presence on the streets with continuing resistance and inevitable violence.“The PAP are trained to beat people, not to crush them with tanks,” Tsang said. “But it will be a painful messy process that will provoke stronger international responses than I think Beijing is calculating at the moment.”Joel Wuthnow at the centre for the study of Chinese military affairs at the National Defense University in Washington suggested that the use of Chinese troops was Beijing’s last option. He told a Center for Strategic and International Studies podcast that it would look terrible and undercut China’s narrative, citing the Tank Man photograph from 1989: “Everyone has a smartphone … You could have hundreds of tank men and women, unarmed men and women standing in front of heavily armed Chinese troops.”A deployment could also easily escalate, he said. “You can’t rule out the possibility of an inadvertent incident, something that spins out of control.”",How far will China go to stamp out Hong Kong protests?,2019-09-01/14:30:06,how far will china go to end hong kong s

"Hong Kong’s top political leader has urged people to refrain from “radical actions” as small businesses geared up for a one-day shutdown and groups called for a boycott of work and classes on Wednesday to protest against a proposed extradition law.The bill, which will allow mainland China to pursue fugitives as well as government critics in the former British colony, is due for a second round of debate on Wednesday in the 70-seat Legislative Council, which is dominated by pro-Beijing lawmakers.Despite a huge protest march on Sunday that drew hundreds of thousands of people, the chief executive, Carrie Lam, said she remained determined to pass the controversial law.Many at the protest on Sunday, from young parents pushing prams to retirees on walking sticks, expressed worries that the civil rights and freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kong under the “one country two systems” arrangement will be quickly eroded under the new law as China often uses non-political crimes to prosecute its critics.“To oppose this bill, some have called for radical actions,” Lam said in a media briefing, referring to the clashes between protesters and police outside the legislature shortly after midnight on Monday, after a largely peaceful, nine-hour protest.“No civilised society would want to see youngsters being pushed to the frontline to take radical actions,” she said. “I urge schools, parents, organisations, corporations and unions to think about this carefully – if they call for radical acts, what good would it do for Hong Kong society and our youth?”Lam’s admonishment underscored the government’s anxiety about the unpopular bill, as hundreds of small businesses across Hong Kong pledged to close on Wednesday while unions as well as parents and teachers’ groups called for a boycott of work and classes so that people could join a protest outside the legislature.The businesses are mostly small retailers such as cafes, book and grocery shops, travel agencies, florists, small hotels, but also include tutorial schools, publishers, interior design and IT shops, opticians, and dental and medical clinics.The pro-democracy Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union called on members to join the protest on Wednesday and urged schools to allow teachers time off. Student unions of seven universities and colleges also said they would boycott classes and join the protest.The Hong Kong aviation industry gathered 1,700 employees’ signatures in an online petition to demand its union initiate a strike to urge the retraction of the “evil” law amendment, while the union of the New World First Bus Company condemned the government for ignoring citizens’ voices and urged its drivers to drive slowly on Wednesday. The pro-democracy Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, which has 190,000 members, also urged its members to stay off work for the day.In anticipation of large protests, the secretariat of the Legislative Council told lawmakers in a memo on Tuesday that it has closed the designated protest area outside its building due to “high risk” that it will be stormed by protesters during upcoming meetings on the extradition bill.Several churches will hold meetings to pray for the city’s leadership and peace for Hong Kong.An online petition called for 50,000 people to surround the legislature at 10pm (1400 GMT) on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday morning, when the debate over the law is scheduled to resume.The legislature’s chairman, Andrew Leung, told a media briefing on Tuesday that he would limit lawmakers’ debate on the extradition bill to 66 hours, meaning that the bill could be put to a vote on 20 June, reported Radio Television Hong Kong.",Hong Kong leader warns against 'radical actions' ahead of strike,2019-06-11/11:50:37,hong kong s top political leader has urged people to refrain from radical actions as small businesses geared up for a one day shutdown and groups called for a boycott of work and classes on wednesday to protest against a proposed extradition law the bill which will allow mainland china to pursue fugitives as well as government critics in the former british colony is due for a second round of debate on wednesday in the  seat legislative council which is dominated by pro beijing lawmakers despite a huge protest march on sunday that drew hundreds of thousands of people the chief executive carrie lam said she remained determined to pass the controversial law many at the protest on sunday from young parents pushing prams to retirees on walking sticks expressed worries that the civil rights and freedoms guaranteed to hong kong under the one country two systems arrangement will be quickly eroded under the new law as china often uses non political crimes to prosecute its critics to oppose this bill some have called for radical actions lam said in a media briefing referring to the clashes between protesters and police outside the legislature shortly after midnight on monday after a largely peaceful nine hour protest no civilised society would want to see youngsters being pushed to the frontline to take radical actions she said i urge schools parents organisations corporations and unions to think about this carefully if they call for radical acts what good would it do for hong kong society and our youth lam s admonishment underscored the government s anxiety about the unpopular bill as hundreds of small businesses across hong kong pledged to close on wednesday while unions as well as parents and teachers groups called for a boycott of work and classes so that people could join a protest outside the legislature the businesses are mostly small retailers such as cafes book and grocery shops travel agencies florists small hotels but also include tutorial schools publishers interior design and it shops opticians and dental and medical clinics the pro democracy hong kong professional teachers union called on members to join the protest on wednesday and urged schools to allow teachers time off student unions of seven universities and colleges also said they would boycott classes and join the protest the hong kong aviation industry gathered   employees signatures in an online petition to demand its union initiate a strike to urge the retraction of the evil law amendment while the union of the new world first bus company condemned the government for ignoring citizens voices and urged its drivers to drive slowly on wednesday the pro democracy hong kong confederation of trade unions which has   members also urged its members to stay off work for the day in anticipation of large protests the secretariat of the legislative council told lawmakers in a memo on tuesday that it has closed the designated protest area outside its building due to high risk that it will be stormed by protesters during upcoming meetings on the extradition bill several churches will hold meetings to pray for the city s leadership and peace for hong kong an online petition called for   people to surround the legislature at pm  gmt on tuesday and stay until wednesday morning when the debate over the law is scheduled to resume the legislature s chairman andrew leung told a media briefing on tuesday that he would limit lawmakers debate on the extradition bill to  hours meaning that the bill could be put to a vote on  june reported radio television hong kong ,Hong Kong Protests,0.20264788
"Hong Kong has been rocked by a series of protests by hundreds of thousands of people in recent weeks, many of which have ended in violent clashes between police and pockets of demonstrators.The protests were initially focused on a bill that that would make it easier to extradite people to China from the semi-autonomous city. But the authorities’ harsh policing of the protests, coupled with a refusal by Hong Kong’s leader to completely withdraw the bill, mean protesters have returned to the streets time and again.The law would allow the extradition of suspects to mainland China for the first time. Supporters say the amendments are key to ensuring the city does not become a criminal refuge, but critics worry Beijing will use the law to extradite political opponents and others to China, where their legal protections cannot be guaranteed.The government claims the push to change the law, which would also apply to Taiwan and Macau, stems from the killing last year of a Hong Kong woman while she was in Taiwan with her boyfriend. Authorities in Taiwan suspect the woman’s boyfriend, who remains in Hong Kong, but cannot try him because no extradition agreement is in place.Under the amended law, those accused of offences punishable by seven years or more in prison could be extradited. The new legislation would give Hong Kong’s leader, known as the chief executive, authority to approve extradition requests, after review by the courts. Hong Kong’s legislature, the legislative council, would not have any oversight over the extradition process.Many Hong Kongers fear the law would be used by authorities to target political enemies and that it would signify the end of the “one country, two systems” policy, eroding the civil rights enjoyed by Hong Kong residents since the handover of  sovereignty from the UK to China in 1997.China has often used allegations of non-political crimes to target government critics, and there are fears that Hong Kong officials would not be able to reject Beijing’s requests.Legal professionals have also expressed concern over the rights of those sent across the border to be tried. The conviction rate in Chinese courts is as high as 99%. Arbitrary detentions, torture and denial of legal representation of one’s choosing are also common.Supporters say the legislation is necessary to plug a “loophole” in the current law and protect Hong Kong from becoming a “haven for international fugitives”. Officials have promised to safeguard against abuses, pledging that no one at risk of political or religious persecution will be sent to the mainland and stressing the role of local judges as “gatekeepers” for extradition requests. Suspects who could face the death penalty would not be extradited.Many protesters say they feel overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness in the face of mainland China’s increasing political, economic and cultural influence in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s top political leader is not elected by ordinary voters but by a 1,200-strong election committee accountable to Beijing.

"Beijing and Hong Kong’s protesters can agree on this much about the unrest now in its ninth week: the turmoil is growing and violence is intensifying. The region is facing its most serious crisis for decades. In the first eight weeks, police fired 160 rubber bullets and 1,000 rounds of teargas. On Monday, they came close to matching those figures in a single day. Meanwhile Beijing issues barely veiled threats, such as the mass drill of 12,000 riot police in Shenzhen, just across the border, or explicit ones: “Those who play with fire will perish by it.”Hong Kong’s fabric is unravelling. Thirteen of the city’s 18 districts have seen protests. The youngest of those arrested is 13, the oldest 76. Thousands of civil servants, finance workers and lawyers have rallied. On Monday, Hong Kong’s first general strike in half a century brought out teachers and construction workers alike, halted metro lines and cancelled hundreds of flights. Many who were largely apathetic about the original issues are furious at the behaviour of politicians and police, but views are polarising: others are angered by or fearful of the disruption.A small but growing number in this leaderless movement has turned to force, mostly against property, but also against police. Others are dismayed by those tactics, and fear the reaction to direct if symbolic attacks on Beijing’s authority, but are outraged by the double standards. A student union leader has been arrested for possession of “offensive weapons” – laser pointers – and others have been charged with rioting, carrying a jail sentence of up to 10 years. In contrast, the men arrested after a gang rampaged through a metro station assaulting suspected protesters with metal and bamboo rods – while police were mysteriously absent – face the much lighter charge of unlawful assembly. Though demands have proliferated, many of those taking part would probably think again if the government formally withdrew the extradition bill which ignited this movement, rather than simply repeating that it is dead, and launched an independent inquiry into the unrest and its policing, as even pro-establishment lawmakers have requested. But officials ruled that out on Wednesday. Protesters are moved more by despair than hope. Some even say they are sticking it out because they could be arrested later: they see it as now or never. A deployment of the People’s Liberation Army remains a last resort for Beijing. Officials in Hong Kong and Beijing probably hope the return of schools and universities in September, as well as the sheer exhaustion of non-stop activism, will take the steam out of the movement before the Communist party celebrates the 70th anniversary of its taking power in China on 1 October. But they also seem to be relying on harsher policing on the streets and a more punitive pursuit of protesters through the justice system. Everything to date suggests this will pour fuel on the fire.

"Hong Kong officials have revealed that 750 of the protesters arrested during four months of unrest are children, sparking outrage in the city, as anger continues to grow over the government’s increasingly hardline measures against demonstrators.The semi-autonomous city’s number two official Matthew Cheung said at a press conference on Thursday it was “shocking and heartbreaking” that 750 out of the 2,379 people arrested – or nearly a third – since June were under 18, and 104 were under 16.Cheung appealed to parents and teachers to admonish youngsters and tell them to refrain from “illegal or violent acts” and avoid getting injured or arrested, something that would “end up destroying [their] future”.The high proportion of children arrested sparked outrage in the community.“[The government] says this is ‘heartbreaking’ but doesn’t ask why. Youth is rising up. They know they’re fighting for their future against a dictatorial regime,” said Kong Tsung-gan, an author and well-known blogger, on Twitter.“Totalitarianism is going to destroy our next generation, resist!” wrote another person on Twitter.On Tuesday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said after school term started in September, nearly 40% of those arrested were under 18, while 10% of those arrested last Sunday were under 15.A growing number of children have been arrested or injured in the increasingly violent and radical protests in recent weeks.A Hong Kong policeman fired at an 18-year-old high school student’s chest during heated, territory-wide protests on China’s National Day on 1 October, while a 14-year-old was shot in the thigh by a plainclothes police officer last Friday during protests against the anti-mask ban. In a recent protest, an 11-year-old was sent to hospital after sustaining an injury.Lam announced last Friday that the government had invoked the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to pass a regulation forbidding the use of face masks. There are widespread fears that the government would introduce more draconian measures to suppress civil freedoms.While Lam said she cared “deeply” for students, she insisted that they should not participate in violent attacks and the anti-mask ban was aimed at “helping parents, teachers and students recognise that they shouldn’t be engaged in these acts.”Schools across Hong Kong required parents to sign a notice saying they understood masks should not be worn inside or outside school, despite the fact that the ban applies only to public protests or assemblies. The Secretary for Education, Kevin Yeung, told reporters on Friday that the Education Bureau has required schools to report the number of students who wear masks to school after the ban was announced but stressed it was not going after schools or students.“When [young people] are on the streets fighting selflessly, they are called ‘criminals and rioters’,” said Kenneth Chan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. “The gap between the young people and the officials is impossible to bridge now.”“It is a total breakdown of trust between the government and young people. It can only get worse because Carrie Lam has nothing but harsh measures to suppress and intimidate the young people and their parents.”",Hong Kong: arrest of 750 children during protests sparks outcry,2019-10-11/07:16:14,hong kong officials have revealed that  of the protesters arrested during four months of unrest are children sparking outrage in the city as anger continues to grow over the government s increasingly hardline measures against demonstrators the semi autonomous city s number two official matthew cheung said at a press conference on thursday it was shocking and heartbreaking that  out of the   people arrested or nearly a third since june were under  and  were under  cheung appealed to parents and teachers to admonish youngsters and tell them to refrain from illegal or violent acts and avoid getting injured or arrested something that would end up destroying their future the high proportion of children arrested sparked outrage in the community the government says this is heartbreaking but doesn t ask why youth is rising up they know they re fighting for their future against a dictatorial regime said kong tsung gan an author and well known blogger on twitter totalitarianism is going to destroy our next generation resist wrote another person on twitter on tuesday hong kong leader carrie lam said after school term started in september nearly  of those arrested were under  while  of those arrested last sunday were under  a growing number of children have been arrested or injured in the increasingly violent and radical protests in recent weeks a hong kong policeman fired at an  year old high school student s chest during heated territory wide protests on china s national day on  october while a  year old was shot in the thigh by a plainclothes police officer last friday during protests against the anti mask ban in a recent protest an  year old was sent to hospital after sustaining an injury lam announced last friday that the government had invoked the emergency regulations ordinance to pass a regulation forbidding the use of face masks there are widespread fears that the government would introduce more draconian measures to suppress civil freedoms while lam said she cared deeply for students she insisted that they should not participate in violent attacks and the anti mask ban was aimed at helping parents teachers and students recognise that they shouldn t be engaged in these acts schools across hong kong required parents to sign a notice saying they understood masks should not be worn inside or outside school despite the fact that the ban applies only to public protests or assemblies the secretary for education kevin yeung told reporters on friday that the education bureau has required schools to report the number of students who wear masks to school after the ban was announced but stressed it was not going after schools or students when young people are on the streets fighting selflessly they are called criminals and rioters said kenneth chan a political science professor at hong kong baptist university the gap between the young people and the officials is impossible to bridge now it is a total breakdown of trust between the government and young people it can only get worse because carrie lam has nothing but harsh measures to suppress and intimidate the young people and their parents ,Hong Kong Protests,0.200044751
"In the spring of 1989, Zhou Guocong had just finished school and taken a job at a pipe factory to help his family – farmers living on the outskirts of Chengdu. At the age of 17 and the youngest of four, he was still a child in many ways. He played with his nieces and nephews and enjoyed cartoons. He was known for being introverted, but loving.On 6 June, Zhou went out, telling his mother he was heading “to play”, and never came home. For the past three decades, Zhou’s mother, Tang Deying, 83, has been seeking redress for the death of her son, one of dozens believed killed in Chengdu as police moved to put down student protests, after Chinese troops did the same a thousand miles away in the capital.Between April and early June 1989, the south-western Chinese city had been overtaken by students protesting in solidarity with their peers in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. In the early hours of 4 June, those students were shot or crushed by tanks as the military cleared the square. In Chengdu, enraged students and citizens poured on to the streets, demanding “blood for blood”. Following Beijing’s lead, the city’s security forces were deployed.Amid the chaos, Tang went looking for her son, talking to his former classmates and their relatives. After a few days, the family learned he had been detained by police. After two months, they received confirmation he had died. Zhou’s sister, Guoyun, who was 20 at the time, remembers her parents sobbing in the next room. “It was a sleepless night,” she told the Observer. As she recalls it, her father’s hair turned white overnight.The police never explained how Zhou died in their custody. After 11 years of constant trips to the police and the local court, Tang was given a photo by police of her son’s body, his face bruised and his nose covered in blood.Tang is emphatic that her son, whom the police accused of being a “counter-revolutionary”, an imprisonable offence at the time, had nothing to do with the protests. He never expressed interest in the issues the students were demonstrating over – government corruption, democratic reforms, or freedoms.“He just wanted to see the crowds,” said Tang, who has for years been placed under heavy surveillance for her efforts. “My son died at the age of 17. Even if he made a mistake, he didn’t deserve death.”Tuesday marks 30 years since the Chinese military cleared student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds – possibly thousands – of unarmed protesters, as well as bystanders, local workers and residents trying to protect the students.The Chinese leadership has worked to erase this chapter from the collective memory, omitting it from history books, censoring all mentions of “6/4” online, jailing those who were involved, as well as detaining any who attempt to memorialise it.In April 1989, popular Chinese reformist leader Hu Yaobang died. Two days after his death, on 17 April, several hundred students marched to Tiananmen Square and laid a wreath to him. They called for greater freedom of speech, economic freedoms and curbs on corruption. The demonstrations spread to hundreds of cities.On 26 April, an editorial in the Communist Party’s People’s Daily denounced the student demonstrations as a ‘premeditated and organised conspiracy and turmoil’. The next day, tens of thousands of students in Beijing staged a demonstration to protest against the editorial. On 13 May, just two days before the arrival of Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev for a state visit, hundreds of students began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. The protests forced the cancellation of the welcoming ceremony. On 20 May, martial law was declared in parts of Beijing. Troops moved in, but were blocked by the civilians and demonstrations continued.In the early hours of 4 June, Chinese troops launched a two-pronged attack with orders to put down the protests. Armoured cars and tanks smashed through the citizens’ barricades. Some forty workers who went to plead with the soldiers were shot. On 5 June, an unidentified young man stood in front of a tank convoy leaving Tiananmen Square, in a final act of defiance. The actual number of deaths from the crackdown remains unknown, but it is believed the Chinese army killed at least 10,000 people, according to a secret diplomatic cable from the British ambassador to Beijing.Thirty years on, the Chinese authorities continue to view the Tiananmen protests as one of the most sensitive and taboo subjects. ‘June 4’, as the movement is commonly known as in China, remains largely scrubbed from official history and is censored from school text books and online. The authorities punish those who try to commemorate the event, and relatives of the victims who died during the massacre are barred from openly mourning their loved ones.Verna Yu in Hong KongPerhaps at even greater risk of being forgotten are the pro-democracy protests that took place in more than 300 Chinese cities at the time. These lesser-known student movements contributed to the government’s ultimate decision to crack down in Tiananmen Square. Their legacy remains today, as authorities go to lengths to ensure such demonstrations don’t happen again.“It was nationwide. It wasn’t just one large protest. That’s what made it much more frightening to the government and one reason why it needed to have a show of force,” said Jonathan Unger, a sociologist at Australian National University, who edited the 1991 book The Pro-Democracy Protests in China: Reports from the Provinces.Protests were reported in 341 Chinese cities between April and June 1989, according to The Tiananmen Papers, a collection of leaked government documents. Between 5 and 8 June, as news of the violence in Beijing spread, the government received reports of demonstrations in 181 cities, including all provincial capitals, major cities and economic zones. By 9 June, most had petered out or were shut down by police.What remains today is an incomplete history of these protests, pieced together by witness accounts and scant details in government reports. The authorities launched a media blackout after the clampdown. Most Chinese who remember the demonstrations in their cities, including Zhou’s sister Guoyun, will not “talk about politics”.“It was a national event, yet we know so little,” said Zhou Fengsuo, a student leader in Beijing, who was later jailed with many other student activists. “They weren’t noticed, many of them we only knew of later, in recent years. We realised pretty much in every county there were protests. Anecdotally, we heard so many reports. Sometimes even just high school students.”When Chen Pokong, a student activist, moved to Guangzhou in 1987, friends told him to forget about bringing political change to the fast-growing trade hub.“People told me Guangzhou was a completely commercial city. People here only care about money. If you want to spread democracy here, no way will anyone listen to you,” said Chen, at the time a young assistant professor of economics.Soon Chen and his students were posting articles by liberal thinkers on campus bulletin boards and holding weekly salons to reflect on the country’s history and future. By late May of 1989, they were organising protests, drawing tens of thousands of people.Historians often attribute the 1989 protests to a paradox of China’s “reform and opening up” of the 1980s. Modernising the lagging economy meant opening the country to new ideas and reforms, but conservative top officials would only go so far.Students, while free to debate and explore new ideas, were subjected to myriad rules dictated by their universities – a remnant of the planned economy where the danwei, or work unit, determined most aspects of one’s personal life.“In one sense it was this enormous opening up and yet you had the party with its instinct to control. The party was doing one thing with the left hand and another with the right hand,” said Unger.In Changsha, in southern China, students were not allowed to date until their third year and, when they were, all romantic relationships had to be registered. Students had a bedtime, as well as designated times to listen to music or sit on their beds, according to an account by Andrea Worden, an English teacher at Hunan Medical College when the protests broke out.When the protests started, students demanded not just political reform, but more personal freedom. By mid-May, students at Worden’s university were skipping classes, plastering poems on the walls and marching in their white medical coats.“The city came alive. The school came alive. People were finally able to express themselves,” Worden said.Protests mirrored those in Beijing, beginning in April, after the death of former leader Hu Yaobang, a reformist beloved by students.“When Beijing students took to the streets, other cities also took to the streets,” said Shao Jiang, one of the student leaders in Beijing.But the influence went both ways. Students travelled between cities, bringing leaflets and magazines to share what was happening on campuses. News was transmitted via fax machines, while others wrote letters or sent telegrams. In Lanzhou, in China’s northern Gansu province, students had a direct line to demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Student teams were responsible for communication between schools, and workers also used the student networks to spread information, Shao said.By 4 June, communication was cut as tanks moved in on Tiananmen Square. Students across the country who had previously taken their cues from Beijing were suddenly on their own.In Lanzhou, the students were better prepared. Thanks to their hotline to Beijing, news of the crackdown reached the activists quickly. By daylight on the morning of 4 June, more than a thousand students had taken over the city, blocking roads, train tracks and a major bridge.“All of the students came out. By dawn, all of Lanzhou was ruled by students,” said a former organiser, still living in China, who asked not to be named for security reasons.He and other students blocked a main bridge, asking bus drivers to leave their vehicles on the bridge with the air let out of the tyres. Residents brought the students water, bread, zongzi (stuffed rice wrapped in a leaf) and salted duck eggs.Protests had sprung up in almost 200 cities in response to the Tiananmen massacre, as students mourned their peers in Beijing. But by 8 June, most of these were over. Lanzhou was one of the last to give up.“Everyone decided to leave, to retreat and be done. There was no more hope. All the students went home,” said the protest organiser.While the highest number of deaths were in Beijing – most estimates range between several hundred and 3,000 – the reprisals and repression against protesters in the provinces, far from international scrutiny, were in some cases worse.Many political prisoners in jail today were active in 1989 in cities other than Beijing. Xie Changfa, involved in the pro-democracy movement in Hunan province, spent two years in a “re-education through labour” camp and is currently serving a 13-year sentence. Li Bifeng, a poet jailed for five years for “counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement” in Chengdu, is serving an additional 10-year sentence. Jiang Fuzhen, now living overseas, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for helping protesters in Qingdao.One little-known episode of violent clashes with police in Xi’an, in central China, early on in the movement, has been documented by a handful of witnesses and government papers.Thousands of protesters had gathered outside the provincial government office on 22 April 1989 to demand a meeting with the governor. Activist Zhao Changqing, a university student at the time, was at the back of the crowd of students, workers and residents. In the late afternoon, some members of the group set cars outside the government offices on fire. A mushroom cloud enveloped the square.Hundreds of riot police arrived with batons and riot shields, beating people, dragging some by their feet and pulling others from trees, where they had fled. Zhao described a sea of people “see-sawing” back and forth as police advanced on protesters and then retreated when the protesters rolled street bins in front of them. Some threw bricks. Zhao said he witnessed at least 100 people being beaten by police.“With one hand holding a shield, and another a baton, they beat the unarmed protesters. It was cruel,” Zhao said. “The image is seared into my mind.”A work report sent to central government three days later, according to The Tiananmen Papers, said “many of the arrested were beaten with sticks, belts and fists”. The report noted: “The poorly educated military police and public security officers were overcome with rage.”The report said 270 people had been arrested, one of whom was “severely injured and in hospital”. According to the report, no one, police or arrestee, was “likely to die”.The scarcity of information raises the possibility that “other Tiananmens” occurred in the spring of 1989. The death toll in Chengdu, as documented by journalist Louisa Lim in her book The People’s Republic of Amnesia, ranges from 10 to 300.Tang and Guoyun, Zhou’s sister in Chengdu, steer away from these questions. Tang says she is still seeking justice for Zhou, but her children are urging her to move on. Guoyun doesn’t care about answers or an apology, just compensation that might give her mother closure.“We just want her to enjoy her last years,” Guoyun said. “Life is short and my parents have worked hard all their lives. If someone is gone, those who are living need to live a better life. That’s the way to honour them.”Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",China’s other Tiananmens: 30 years on,2019-06-02/09:00:36,in the spring of  zhou guocong had just finished school and taken a job

april after the death of former leader hu yaobang a reformist beloved by students when beijing students took to the streets other cities also took to the streets said shao jiang one of the student leaders in beijing but the influence went both ways students travelled between cities bringing leaflets and magazines to share what was happening on campuses news was transmitted via fax machines while others wrote letters or sent telegrams in lanzhou in china s northern gansu province students had a direct line to demonstrators in tiananmen square student teams were responsible for communication between schools and workers also used the student networks to spread information shao said by  june communication was cut as tanks moved in on tiananmen square students across the country who had previously taken their cues from beijing were suddenly on their own in lanzhou the students were better prepared thanks to their hotline to beijing news of the crackdown reached the activists quickly by daylight on the morning of  june more than a thousand students had taken over the city blocking roads train tracks and a major bridge all of the students came out by dawn all of lanzhou was ruled by students said a former organiser still living in china who asked not to be named for security reasons he and other students blocked a main bridge asking bus drivers to leave their vehicles on the bridge with the air let out of the tyres residents brought the students water bread zongzi stuffed rice wrapped in a leaf and salted duck eggs protests had sprung up in almost  cities in response to the tiananmen massacre as students mourned their peers in beijing but by  june most of these were over lanzhou was one of the last to give up everyone decided to leave to retreat and be done there was no more hope all the students went home said the protest organiser while the highest number of deaths were in beijing most estimates range between several hundred and   the reprisals and repression against protesters in the provinces far from international scrutiny were in some cases worse many political prisoners in jail today were active in  in cities other than beijing xie

qingdao one little known episode of violent clashes with police in xi an in central china early on in the movement has been documented by a handful of witnesses and government papers thousands of protesters had gathered outside the provincial government office on  april  to demand a meeting with the governor activist zhao changqing a university student at the time was at the back of the crowd of students workers and residents in the late afternoon some members of the group set cars outside the government offices on fire a mushroom cloud enveloped the square hundreds of riot police arrived with batons and riot shields beating people dragging some by their feet and pulling others from trees where they had fled zhao described a sea of people see sawing back and forth as police advanced on protesters and then retreated when the protesters rolled street bins in front of them some threw bricks zhao said he witnessed at least  people being beaten by police with one hand holding a shield and another a baton they beat the unarmed protesters it was cruel zhao said the image is seared into my mind a work report sent to central government three days later according to the tiananmen papers said many of the arrested were beaten with sticks belts and fists the report noted the poorly educated military police and public security officers were overcome with rage the report said  people had been arrested one of whom was severely injured and in hospital according to the report no one police or arrestee was likely to die the scarcity of information raises the possibility that other

"After another weekend of violent clashes between protesters and police, Hong Kong held its collective breath on Monday afternoon as the Chinese state council’s Hong Kong and Macau affairs office – the cabinet-level office with responsibility for Hong Kong policy – held a press conference to give its views on the “Hong Kong problem”.With official state media over the past week ramping up reports of “extremist elements” and foreign “black hands”, and senior establishment figures openly referring to the possibility of the People’s Liberation Army being deployed, Hong Kongers were braced for potentially paradigm-shifting news. It seemed almost anything was possible, from the resignation of the unpopular incumbent chief executive, Carrie Lam, to the imposition of a curfew to PLA troops on the streets of Hong Kong.As expected, the office’s spokesman Yang Guang expressed support for Lam and her administration, decried the use of violence by protesters, and insisted that Hong Kong’s rule of law should be upheld. But, as with so many messages in China, it was the unspoken that rang loudest.To begin with, Yang acknowledged the peaceful protests that had been held in opposition to Lam’s extradition bill, and further acknowledged that Lam had suspended work on the bill as a result. This in itself was remarkable: it would seem anathema to Beijing to publicly recognise the fact and effectiveness of political protest in Hong Kong, when such a possibility is unthinkable in the mainland.Second, while Yang unsurprisingly expressed support for Lam and her administration, his comments contained veiled criticism. Yang said that there had been “deficiencies” in the way Lam’s administration handled the extradition bill, leading the council to “reflect” upon its governing style. In China, where leaders are universally regarded as infallible (until, that is, they very publicly fall from grace) this is an extremely harsh statement. It also has some historical resonance: following similar mass demonstrations in Hong Kong, then-president Hu Jintao famously advised Hong Kong’s inaugural chief executive Tung Chee-hwa to “identify his deficiencies” in a December 2004 public appearance. By the following March, Tung had resigned, citing ill health. Today’s thinly veiled criticism does not bode well for the longevity of Lam’s administration.Beijing regards this, quite correctly, as a purely domestic problem for Hong KongThe focus in Yang’s prepared remarks on upholding Hong Kong’s rule of law, and severely punishing those who have engaged in acts of violence, was clearly intended for consumption by an international audience for whom Hong Kong’s rule of law is seen as a core value. But alongside this statement, Yang also expressed support for Hong Kong’s police force in its mission of upholding the law. This was a clear indication from Beijing that it has no intention of involving the PLA, however it also signalled Beijing’s assent to the Hong Kong police adopting harsher policing tactics. It is perhaps no coincidence that police also announced today that they would begin road tests this week for three powerful new riot control water cannon vehicles, with a view to deploying them on Hong Kong’s streets by mid-August.Also surprising, given recent rhetoric, was that the malign influence of “foreign forces” did not receive more airtime. Indeed, foreign influence was not addressed in Yang’s initial prepared remarks, and was only raised in a question from official state news agency Xinhua. While Yang did criticise foreign politicians, who he said wanted to make Hong Kong into a “problem” for China, there were no references to “colour revolutions” or ”black hands”, a welcome dialling-back on recent hysteria. This suggests that those in the highest levels of government in Beijing regard this, quite correctly, as a purely domestic problem for Hong Kong. Unfortunately, they seem to continue to be looking to blame it on the wrong targets. Affairs office spokeswoman Xu Luying, speaking of social problems in Hong Kong, focused on economic issues such as youth opportunity, social mobility and housing affordability. This holds out hope that Beijing intends to work with the Hong Kong government and, perhaps more importantly, Hong Kong’s all-powerful tycoons in addressing housing prices and other business and economic issues.However, while these indeed contribute to discontent in Hong Kong, Beijing would be sorely mistaken to believe this to be the root cause. The real motivation bringing Hong Kong people out on to the streets every weekend can be heard in the slogans they now chant: “Democracy now!” and “Reclaim Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!”The extradition bill that originally motivated the present protest movement and the livelihood issues Beijing is targeting are merely symptomatic of what Hong Kong’s protesters see as the underlying cause: Hong Kong’s undemocratic system, under which the people are governed by a government beholden to Beijing and accountable to Hong Kong’s tycoon class, and not governing in the interests of the people. Until democratic reforms are introduced, the protesters believe, Hong Kong will not see meaningful change.With no policy initiatives or specific measures coming out of today’s announcements, one thing is certain: protests in Hong Kong will continue. If Beijing does not realise that it will take more than economic fixes to bring an end to the current crisis, the cycle of protest and crackdown seems likely only to intensify.• Antony Dapiran is a Hong Kong-based writer and lawyer and the author of City of Protest: A Recent History of Dissent in Hong Kong",China is looking for a quick economic fix in Hong Kong.

"The UK is suspending future sales of teargas and other crowd control equipment to Hong Kong until an independent investigation is held into allegations of police brutality during mass protests earlier this month.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who is campaigning to be the next prime minister, said no new export licences would be approved until concerns about human rights abuses were “thoroughly addressed”. His statement appeared to leave existing export licences untouched, including open licences not due to expire until 2020.“We remain very concerned with the situation in Hong Kong and I raised those concerns with the chief executive [Carrie Lam, the semi-autonomous territory’s leader] on the 12th of June,” Hunt said. “I today urge the Hong Kong government to establish a robust independent investigation into the violent scenes that we saw.”Hong Kong police used teargas and rubber bullets against protesters opposed to a proposed extradition law they said would allow China to target political enemies and try them in its opaque courts, where the conviction rate is as high as 99%. Some of the equipment used by police was sold by British firms.Britain ruled Hong Kong from 1842 to 1997, when it handed the colony back to China.A government source said: “As it stands all licences for any crowd control equipment have been exhausted, so there are no existing licences that would mean we could continue to sell crowd control equipment to Hong Kong.”Amnesty International has said experts in policing and digital verification examined footage of 14 incidents of apparent police violence during a protest on 12 June in detail. “The evidence of the unlawful use of force by police against peaceful protesters on 12 June is irrefutable. In the footage Amnesty has verified, police officers appear out of control, placing peaceful protesters who posed no threat in danger of serious injury,” said Man-kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.On 15 June Lam promised to indefinitely suspend efforts to pass the law.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said there was a need for a “root and branch” reform of the arms export regime. “If exported items from the UK are being used for internal repression of protest in any country, that is a clear breach of the rules on arms exports licences,” she said.Ministers have allowed several licences permitting the exportation to Hong Kong of equipment including anti-riot shields, body armour, CS hand grenades and ammunition. These include two open licences, granted in 2015 and 2016, under which an unlimited quantity of material can be sold for five years. This would suggest that unless existing licences are revoked, a point not covered in the foreign secretary’s statement, exports can continue until 2020.",UK halts sale of teargas to Hong Kong amid police brutality claims,2019-06-25/16:49:42,the uk is suspending future sales of teargas and other crowd control equipment to hong kong until an independent investigation is held into allegations of police brutality during mass protests earlier this month the foreign secretary jeremy hunt who is campaigning to be the next prime minister said no new export licences would be approved until concerns about human rights abuses were thoroughly addressed his statement appeared to leave existing export licences untouched including open licences not due to expire until  we remain very concerned with the situation in hong kong and i raised those concerns with the chief executive carrie lam the semi autonomous territory s leader on the th of june hunt said i today urge the hong kong government to establish a robust independent investigation into the violent scenes that we saw hong kong police used teargas and rubber bullets against protesters opposed to a proposed extradition law they said would allow china to target political enemies and try them in its opaque courts where the conviction rate is as high as  some of the equipment used by police was sold by british firms britain ruled hong kong from  to  when it handed the colony back to china a government source said as it stands all licences for any crowd control equipment have been exhausted so there are no existing licences that would mean we could continue to sell crowd control equipment to hong kong amnesty international has said experts in policing and digital verification examined footage of  incidents of apparent police violence during a protest on  june in detail the evidence of the unlawful use of force by police against peaceful protesters on  june is irrefutable in the footage amnesty has verified police officers appear out of control placing peaceful protesters who posed no threat in danger of serious injury said man kei tam the director of amnesty international hong kong on  june lam promised to indefinitely suspend efforts to pass the law emily thornberry the shadow foreign secretary said there was a need for a root and branch reform of the arms export regime if exported items from the uk are being used for internal repression of protest in any country that is a clear breach of the rules on arms exports licences she said ministers have allowed several licences permitting the exportation to hong kong of equipment including anti riot shields body armour cs hand grenades and ammunition these include two open licences granted in  and  under which an unlimited quantity of material can be sold for five years this would suggest that unless existing licences are revoked a point not covered in the foreign secretary s statement exports can continue until  ,Hong Kong Protests,0.192139015
"The Chinese government has issued a strong condemnation of protesters who stormed and vandalised Hong Kong’s legislature, calling the act “totally intolerable”, as the UK warned China of serious consequences if it breached an agreement guaranteeing freedoms in the city.In a statement carried by the state-run Xinhua news agency, the Chinese government’s top representative organisation in Hong Kong said it was “shocked, indignant and strongly condemned” the vandalising of the parliament building, which followed a day of protests on Monday against an extradition bill.The events pose an unprecedented challenge to the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and Beijing asked Hong Kong to investigate the “criminal responsibility of violent offenders” for “serious illegal actions”. Protesters could face up to 10 years in prison if prosecuted and convicted for rioting.“Some extreme elements used excessive violence to storm the legislature building and carried out a series of large-scale assaults. This is shocking, heartbreaking and angering,” the statement said. “Their violent acts are an extreme challenge to Hong Kong’s rule of law and seriously undermined Hong Kong’s peace and stability. It is totally intolerable.”The Hong Kong and Macau affairs office of China’s state council issued a similarly worded statement of condemnation, vowing to support the Hong Kong authorities in investigating the “violent offenders’ criminal responsibility”.It said 1 July, the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover of sovereignty from British to Chinese rule, should have been a “joyous day” but “extreme radicals” had instead stormed the legislature.Under the terms of the 1997 handover from British to Chinese rule, Hong Kong enjoys rights and liberties unseen on the mainland. But protesters accuse Beijing of reneging on that deal, and anger over a proposed bill to allow extradition to the opaque mainland Chinese court system has turned into wider protests against the government.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned against using the vandalism of the legislature as a pretext to attack the city’s freedoms. “The UK signed an internationally binding legal agreement in 1984 that enshrines the one country, two systems rule, [and] enshrines the basic freedoms of the people of Hong Kong,” he said.“We stand four square behind that agreement, four square behind the people of Hong Kong. There will be serious consequences if that internationally binding legal agreement were not to be honoured.” Hunt did not specify what those consequences would be.Separately, the UK said there were no existing export licences to sell tear gas or other crowd control equipment to the Hong Kong police. Rubber bursting tear gas grenades that were manufactured in Derby by British company Chemring, have been discovered by protestors, apparently from existing stockpiles.The last UK licence - for law enforcement training purposes - was worth £110,726 and granted in July 2018 at around the time a previous licence with an unlimited value from July 2015 had expired. Arms trade campaigners in the UK had been concerned the second tear gas licence was still valid despite Hunt’s statement two weeks ago would suspend future sales of CS grenades.Hong Kong police had fired teargas early on Tuesday to disperse hundreds of defiant protesters who had occupied the legislature. As smoke filled the air, hundreds of protesters wearing hard hats, goggles and masks ran away, clutching umbrellas to protect themselves against the chemicals and also to shield themselves from security cameras.At least 54 people were taken to hospital after the protests, according to the Hong Kong hospital authority.In a pre-dawn press conference, Carrie Lam, the city’s Beijing-appointed chief executive, described the scenes of vandalism as “heartbreaking and shocking”. She said: “This is something we should seriously condemn because nothing is more important than the rule of law in Hong Kong.”The president of the legislative council said repairs to the “extensively damaged” complex were expected to take a long time. In a break with their silence over the pro-democracy demonstrations in recent weeks, Chinese state media ran footage on Tuesday of police in Hong Kong clearing protesters from streets and moving into roads surrounding the legislative council.The Global Times, a Communist party mouthpiece, called for “zero tolerance” of the incident. “Out of blind arrogance and rage, protesters showed a complete disregard for law and order,” said both the Chinese and English versions of its editorial on Tuesday.“Chinese society is all too aware that a zero-tolerance policy is the only remedy for such destructive behaviour witnessed. Otherwise, and without this policy, it would be similar to opening a Pandora’s Box,” it said.The state-run China Daily paper published a celebratory news report about the anniversary of the handover. “A festive atmosphere enveloped Hong Kong on Monday as people from different backgrounds joined various activities to celebrate the anniversary,” the newspaper said.The article mentioned the protests only in its final paragraphs. “Also on Monday, a large number of protesters took to the streets to march against the government’s suspended extradition amendment bill. Some clashed with police as they stormed into the legislative council,” it said.An editorial reiterated the principle of one country, two systems, saying the former British colony was an “inalienable” part of China and that Hong Kong affairs concerned only China. “The only way for the special administrative region to sustain economic growth and maintain stability is for it to further integrate its own development into the nation’s overall development,” the newspaper said.Support for the protests came from Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province. Its president, Tsai Ing-wen, urged the Hong Kong authorities to listen to the protests. “As president of a country that walked the long road to democracy, I urge the Hong Kong government to address the legitimate concerns of the people and their pursuit of freedom & democracy,” she tweeted.Additional reporting by Christy Choi in Hong Kong",China says Hong Kong violence 'totally

"The Chinese government has expressed its anger with Germany’s foreign minister over his meeting with the Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, saying the encounter was “disrespectful” of Beijing’s sovereignty.Wong tweeted a picture of himself and Heiko Maas following his arrival in Berlin, saying the two had discussed the “protest situation and our cause”.The 22-year-old, arrested in August for his role in the protests which have challenged Beijing, was feted by German politicians and media commentators at a party in the rooftop restaurant of the Reichstag building on Monday night hosted by the Bild tabloid.In Berlin I spoke to Foreign Minister @HeikoMaas on protests situation and our cause to free election and democracy in HK. Anticipating further discussion with members of German Bundestag in coming days. pic.twitter.com/y8VCUZrE6sSpeaking to the gathering, Wong pledged to continue to “protest until the day that we have free elections” and compared Hong Kong with communist East Germany during the pro-democracy protests that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall.“If we are now in a new cold war, Hong Kong is the new Berlin,” Wong told the gathering. “We urge the free world to stand together with us in resisting the autocratic Chinese regime.”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongHe had been briefly detained in Hong Kong by authorities immediately before his departure to Germany, apparently following a mistake related to his bail conditions.The former student leader of pro-democracy protests in 2014 was one of several activists arrested in late August. The case was adjourned until November and he was released on HK$10,000 (£1,045) bail.Wong told the Berlin gathering he had been arrested eight times and held in detention for 100 days.In a statement a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry accused Berlin of interfering in the country’s affairs.“It is extremely wrong for German media and politicians to attempt to tap into the anti-China separatist wave,” Hua Chunying said at a press briefing on Tuesday, adding that the government “strongly disapproved” of the meeting. “It is disrespectful towards China’s sovereignty and an interference in China’s internal affairs.”Germany’s foreign ministry rejected the criticism. A spokesman said it was normal for the foreign minister to “hold meetings with members of civil society and for the government to stand up for freedom of speech”.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who visited Beijing last week with an entourage of business leaders, said she had discussed the protests during her meetings with officials. She reportedly stressed to China’s premier, Li Keqiang, on Friday that the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong “must be guaranteed”.Wong, who is due to address students and the public on Wednesday evening at the Humboldt University in Berlin before travelling to the US, said he planned to hold further talks with political leaders in Germany. There was no meeting scheduled with Merkel, according to her spokesman, Steffen Seibert.Last week, Wong made headlines in Germany after calling for two panda cubs, born last month to pandas at Berlin zoo who have been rented from the Chinese government, to be named “Democracy” and “Freedom”, in order to “send a very clear signal to China”. A national campaign has called for the cubs to be called “Hong” and “Kong”.",Hong Kong activist's visit to Berlin draws anger from China,2019-09-10/16:12:52,the chinese government has expressed its

living in one of the world s most expensive densely populated cities the protest movement was given fresh impetus on  july when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station while authorities seemingly did little to intervene underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro beijing establishment

"Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Hong Kong on Wednesday to denounce Cathay Pacific for firing staff after it came under pressure from Beijing – describing the case as symptomatic of the wider intimidation of protesters and sympathisers. Businesses, pushed to voice support for the authorities, are facing a growing backlash from employees and customers who see the pressure as part of a broad strategy to wear down opposition after two and a half months of protests sparked by a controversial extradition bill. “It’s not just an issue for Cathay,” said one demonstrator, a retiree who gave her name as Miss Chan. “They want to [persuade] the public that if you go on a demonstration you may be punished; even if you are not arrested, you might lose employment opportunities. They are trying to expand the fear, which is already huge in Hong Kong.”Protesters, many from the aviation industry, rallied in the financial district before marching to the headquarters of Swire Pacific, the airline’s controlling shareholder.Later on Wednesday night thousands of protesters attended a separate rally against alleged sexual violence by police against participants in the movement.The airline was caught in the political storm when one of its pilots was charged over a protest. Its chairman initially said that “we certainly wouldn’t dream of telling [our staff] what they have to think about something”. But China’s aviation authority told the airline it would have to remove any staff involved in or supportive of protests from flights over its airspace. A state-owned bank rated Cathay stock a strong sell and Chinese firms withdrew business.The arrested pilot was sacked and the airline’s chief executive, Rupert Hogg, quit – news which, strikingly, first emerged in Chinese state media. Last week, the chair of the flight attendants union at the subsidiary Cathay Dragon said she had been sacked after managers presented her with copies of protest-related Facebook posts; the Confederation of Trade Unions plans a legal challenge. Cathay, which said that the measure was not related to her union activities, reiterated before the rally that it upheld Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms but had a zero-tolerance approach “to any support for or participation in illegal protests, violent activities or overly radical behaviour”.The pressure on the firm was unprecedented, said David Webb, a shareholder activist and founder of Webb-site, which reports on Hong Kong affairs, adding that he was dismayed rather than surprised by the outcome. “Individually I understand why companies don’t speak up. Collectively they should,” he said, suggesting chambers of commerce should take a stronger stand.Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, described the extent of the pressure on companies as a “turning point”.Last weekend the MTR rail system closed stations along protest routes for the first time. The company and the Hong Kong government – its majority shareholder – said it was simply protecting staff and passengers, but activists noted that the decision came shortly after mainland state media accused it of having “arranged special trains for rioters to escape” and asked whether it was “an accomplice to rioters”. Though the business community was hostile to the extradition bill, some tycoons have recently emerged at pro- government rallies. Some protesters are boycotting the restaurants, stores or shopping malls of such figures as a result. But for many businesses, the calculation is simple. Around a fifth of Cathay’s business is thought to be to the mainland – where Swire also has substantial interests – and almost all other flights pass through its airspace.Even people rallying against Cathay admitted they did not expect it to reverse its policy. “Of course we won’t change its mind – but it’s also sending a message to other companies that we cannot let this white terror spread,” said Marcel Chan, who works in the transport industry.Many fear that retaliation will be even more likely when the protests eventually end, with companies and institutions pushed to marginalise participants or let them go.“If we don’t protest now we won’t be allowed to in future,” said a teacher who had turned out to support the aviation workers. “They want to control education, too.”Universities have long been under pressure. On Wednesday the overseas edition of the state-run People’s Daily accused some Hong Kong teachers of planting radical ideas in the minds of students and said those with “no ethics” should be sacked.Meanwhile thousands of protesters overflowed from a park in the central business district on Wednesday night to rally against police harassment of female protesters arrested at anti-government demonstrations.Many in the female-dominated crowd scrawled #protesttoo on their bodies in lipstick while others donned purple ribbons and waved purple lights in a sign of solidarity with women who say they have been groped by police officers or abused in detention over the past three months.Headlining the rally was a female protester who at a press conference last week publicly accused police of indecent assault. She described how she had been aggressively strip-searched after her arrest. The woman said she had then undergone a humiliating cavity search by two female officers only to discover a handful of male officers were waiting immediately outside, according to Hong Kong Free Press.The protester spoke of her intense shame during the encounter. She did not disclose her identity, was dressed in a mask, sunglasses, hat and black sweatshirt, and asked for reporters to refer to her by a pseudonym – reflecting the fact that sexual harassment and gender-based violence remain largely taboo subjects for many Hongkongers.There have only been a handful of public #metoo cases in the conservative city in recent years; the most high-profile case, of the athlete Vera Lui, ended in acquittal for her coach after she accused him of sexual assault.Police violence, however, appears to have begun a city-wide conversation about sexual harassment, as both men and women carried signs with slogans such as “Stop Hong Kong police’s use of sexual violence!”While men have dominated a number of anti-government rallies over the past three months, according to a survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, female representation has averaged around 45% at 12 major protests.Wednesday’s rally was the first event to specifically target women since demonstrations began in early June.“I would say our culture is ‘women should stay behind and guys to the front’, so I hope this is an opportunity for us to stand out internationally,” said protester Aqua Wong, who had scrawled #protesttoo on her chest above her black outfit.Other protesters reiterated their calls for an independent inquiry into police violence. While the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, has promised a fact finding study into police tactics, she has failed to deliver on public demand for a formal inquiry led by a judge.Protester Pas Lek said she thought it was “fishy” that the government had failed to set up an independent review despite social media posts and videos of women being mistreated, including a widely shared clip of a woman whose skirt was pushed up exposing her genitals as she was aggressively arrested.“If the police or the government insisted the police didn’t do [anything wrong] then why don’t they set up an independent investigation council assessing that?” asked Lek.Mass protests began in Hong Kong on 9 June against a legislative bill that would have allowed for residents to stand trial in mainland China. Many protesters felt this bill would infringe on the city’s autonomy, promised until 2047, under the “one country, two systems” agreement with Beijing.Protests, however, show no sign of ending even after Lam promised she would not move forward with the bill.

"The British government and MPs are to be the focus of a digital advertising campaign in which Hong Kong pro-democracy activists will plead for the UK to take action to protect rights in the former colony.A group of activists have paid for adverts that appeared on Wednesday in British media outlets calling on the UK government to impose sanctions on those responsible for what is described as the suppression of human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong.They also call on Britain to include provisions on human rights, civil liberties and democratisation in any post-Brexit agreements with Hong Kong and China.The adverts accompany a digital campaign featuring images of Margaret Thatcher in Beijing for the signing of the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration that guaranteed freedom of speech, freedom of the press and other rights in Hong Kong.“In 1984, Britain pledged to protect Hong Kong’s freedom. Britain must keep its promises,” say the adverts, which have been taken out by a grouping that is remaining anonymous in the face of fears of retribution by the Chinese government. The campaign has been by funded by donations, with £300,000 raised in less than 24 hours.Members of the public are being urged to sign a petition. The campaign, launched by what is described as “a group of concerned Hongkongers around the world”, accuses China of consistently breaching the terms of the 1984 agreement. The latest breach, it says, came in the form of the extradition bill that has caused Hong Kong’s largest political crisis in decades.Protests that have principally targeted the bill, which would allow suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China, have taken on new demands, including an investigation into police use of rubber bullets, teargas and physical violence against protesters.Protesters this week pledged to stand up to thugs who attacked demonstrators at the weekend as public anger grows towards the government and police.Demonstrators have filed for a permit to hold a rally on Saturday in Yuen Long, the district on the outskirts of Hong Kong where dozens of masked men chased and beat commuters and protesters with wooden poles and metal rods, leaving at least 45 people in hospital. Police arrived after the assailants left.A Foreign Office minister told the House of Commons on Monday that Britain remained fully committed to upholding Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms under the “one country, two systems” principle.Andrew Murrison said Britain would be keeping a “close eye” on the police investigation in Hong Kong into the attack in Yuen Long.Dr Victor Gao, a former high-ranking Chinese diplomat, told the BBC on Tuesday that allegations that China had a hand in the attacks were groundless, describing allegations as “fake news”.“At this particular moment let’s give due process more time. However, when rioting on such a large scale happened in Hong Kong no one should indulge in the fantasy that the people on the other side of the equation will wait until they are engulfed in instability,” he said.“Villagers in Yuen Long … want to make sure that no rioters come to their village and I think let’s wait for the investigation.”",Hong Kong activists target UK government with ad campaign,2019-07-24/10:52:49,the british government and mps are to be the focus of a digital advertising campaign in which hong kong pro democracy activists will plead for the uk to take action to protect rights in the former colony a group of activists have paid for adverts that appeared on wednesday in british media outlets calling on the uk government to impose sanctions on those responsible for what is described as the suppression of human rights and freedoms in hong kong they also call on britain to include provisions on human rights civil liberties and democratisation in any post brexit agreements with hong kong and china the adverts accompany a digital campaign featuring images of margaret thatcher in beijing for the signing of the  sino british joint declaration that guaranteed freedom of speech freedom of the press and other rights in hong kong in  britain pledged to protect hong kong s freedom britain must keep its promises say the adverts which have been taken out by a grouping that is remaining anonymous in the face of fears of retribution by the chinese government the campaign has been by funded by donations with   raised in less than  hours members of the public are being urged to sign a petition the campaign launched by what is described as a group of concerned hongkongers around the world accuses china of consistently breaching the terms of the  agreement the latest breach it says came in the form of the extradition bill that has caused hong kong s largest political crisis in decades protests that have principally targeted the bill which would allow suspects to be extradited from hong kong to mainland china have taken on new demands including an investigation into police use of rubber bullets teargas and physical violence against protesters protesters this week pledged to stand up to thugs who attacked demonstrators at the weekend as public anger grows towards the government and police demonstrators have filed for a permit to hold a rally on saturday in yuen long the district on the outskirts of hong kong where dozens of masked men chased and beat commuters and protesters with wooden poles and metal rods leaving at least  people in hospital police arrived after the assailants left a foreign office minister told the house of commons on monday that britain remained fully committed to upholding hong kong s high degree of autonomy rights and freedoms under the one country two systems principle andrew murrison said britain would be keeping a close eye on the police investigation in hong kong into the attack in yuen long dr victor gao a former high ranking chinese diplomat told the bbc on tuesday that allegations that china had a hand in the attacks were groundless describing allegations as fake news at this particular moment let s give due process more time however when rioting on such a large scale happened in hong kong no one should indulge in the fantasy that the people on the other side of the equation will wait until they are engulfed in instability he said villagers in yuen long want to make sure that no rioters come to their village and i think let s wait for the investigation ,Hong Kong Protests,0.188179165
"Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents have taken to the streets to demand their government halt a plan that would make it easier to extradite people to the secretive judicial system in mainland China.The march organisers estimated that more than 100,000 people filed through central Hong Kong on Sunday. Police said the march drew 22,800 people at its peak.The plan proposed by the city’s security bureau, and pushed by Carrie Lam, the chief executive, would allow Hong Kong to send criminal suspects requested by China, Taiwan or Macau. None of those jurisdictions has a rendition agreement with Hong Kong. Hong Kongers fear the law will allow China to demand that Hong Kong turn over political dissidents, religious workers and business people whose work may violate some yet-to-be-written law.“They say if you’re innocent you shouldn’t be afraid,” said Alex Ho, a Catholic school teacher who marched most of the route carrying his 18-month-old daughter, Stella. “But the legal system in China changes. They can make up the law and say that people did whatever they want.”It was the biggest protest for several years, activists and journalists said, in a city known for a 79-day occupation for democratic elections in 2014.Some protesters said they showed up to support nine activists who were convicted earlier this month of public nuisance charges related to the 2014 event. Four of those were sentenced to prison, with two professors getting 16-month terms. Their supporters collected thousands of dollars for their appeals.Fears that the amendment will pass led one prominent resident to flee. Lam Wing-kee, who smuggled gossipy books about Chinese leaders, landed in Taiwan last week where he plans to seek residency. Lam disappeared in 2015 and resurfaced months later to say he’d been kidnapped and held by Chinese security. “If the ordinance is passed, I won’t be allowed to leave, because I have been charged with a crime and am wanted for it,” he told Bloomberg before leaving.Ronny Tong Ka-wah, a member of the executive council, the city’s advisory unit, urged the government not to favour public pressure. “If the government surrenders just because there are some opposing voices, I am afraid it will be difficult to have effective governance in the future,” he said, according to the South China Morning Post.The protest drew people who said they have never marched, or have not done so in years. “Everyone, whatever their background, everyone will be caught up by the central government [in Beijing] without reason,” said a civil servant who would identify herself only as Ada. She said she had not protested since 1989 when students sought democracy in China.Think about the booksellers and their forced confessions, said her friend, Iris. “You’re an idiot if you believe Carrie Lam,” she said.Hong Kong has many extradition agreements, but not with China, Taiwan or Macau in the nearly 22 years since Britain relinquished the territory. Hong Kong crafted this new proposal after Taiwanese officials asked Hong Kong to send a 19-year-old man wanted for the murder of his pregnant girlfriend. Hong Kong authorities arrested Chan Tong-kai but could only charge him with money laundering.Lam has urged Hong Kong’s legislature to pass the amendment before July. Otherwise, the city’s courts might free the suspect. Lawmaker Alvin Yeung offered a counter-proposal on Friday that would allow Hong Kong’s courts to try Chan for murder in local courts.Many international organisations have asked Lam to alter the proposal. That includes Hong Kong’s most influential business group, the American Chamber of Commerce, which said it could sweep business people into China’s legal orbit. Taipei officials say they will not sign any agreement that implies Taiwan is part of China.Margaret Ng, a former lawmaker, addressed the crowd at the end of the route. “People from all the world must support Hong Kong,” she said once off the stage. “It’s the freest city in China … If they pass it, it will be very difficult to see Hong Kong as a different place from China.”",Hong Kong residents protest at plans for extradition to China,2019-04-28/15:31:06,tens of thousands of hong kong residents have taken to the streets to demand their government halt a plan that would make it easier to extradite people to the secretive judicial system in mainland china the march organisers estimated that more than   people filed through central hong kong on sunday police said the march drew   people at its peak the plan proposed by the city s security bureau and pushed by carrie lam the chief executive would allow hong kong to send criminal suspects requested by china taiwan or macau none of those jurisdictions has a rendition agreement with hong kong hong kongers fear the law will allow china to demand that hong kong turn over political dissidents religious workers and business people whose work may violate some yet to be written law they say if you re innocent you shouldn t be afraid said alex ho a catholic school teacher who marched most of the route carrying his  month old daughter stella but the legal system in china changes they can make up the law and say that people did whatever they want it was the biggest protest for several years activists and journalists said in a city known for a  day occupation for democratic elections in  some protesters said they showed up to support nine activists who were convicted earlier this month of public nuisance charges related to the  event four of those were sentenced to prison with two professors getting  month terms their supporters collected thousands of dollars for their appeals fears that the amendment will pass led one prominent resident to flee lam wing kee who smuggled gossipy books about chinese leaders landed in taiwan last week where he plans to seek residency lam disappeared in  and resurfaced months later to say he d been kidnapped and held by chinese security if the ordinance is passed i won t be allowed to leave because i have been charged with a crime and am wanted for it he told bloomberg before leaving ronny tong ka wah a member of the executive council the city s advisory unit urged the government not to favour public pressure if the government surrenders just because there are some opposing voices i am afraid it will be difficult to have effective governance in the future he said according to the south china morning post the protest drew people who said they have never marched or have not done so in years everyone whatever their background everyone will be caught up by the central government in beijing without reason said a civil servant who would identify herself only as ada she said she had not protested since  when students sought democracy in china think about the booksellers and their forced confessions said her friend iris you re an idiot if you believe carrie lam she said hong kong has many extradition agreements but not with china taiwan or macau in the nearly  years since britain relinquished the territory hong kong crafted this new proposal after taiwanese officials asked hong kong to send a  year old man wanted for the murder of his pregnant girlfriend hong kong authorities arrested chan tong kai but could only charge him with money laundering lam has urged hong kong s legislature to pass the amendment before july otherwise the city s courts might free the suspect lawmaker alvin yeung offered a counter proposal on friday that would allow hong kong s courts to try chan for murder in local courts many international organisations have asked lam to alter the proposal that includes hong kong s most influential business group the american chamber of commerce which said it could sweep business people into china s legal orbit taipei officials say they will not sign any agreement that implies taiwan is part of china margaret ng a former lawmaker addressed the crowd at the end of the route people from all the world must support hong kong she said once off the stage it s the freest city in china if they pass it it will be very difficult to see hong kong as a different place from china ,Hong Kong Protests,0.185200632
"More than 100,000 people have gathered in Hong Kong for a candlelight vigil to mark the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.The event is the biggest and traditionally the only major commemoration of the incident allowed in China. Taiwan also marked the massacre with a vigil and exhibition on “Tank man” – the man photographed standing in front of tanks on 5 June 1989.On the mainland, all talk of the Chinese army’s killing of thousands of peaceful student protesters is forbidden. But Hong Kong has had a level of independence under the “one country, two systems” rule enacted after Britain relinquished control to China in 1997.On Tuesday evening, crowds filled the six football pitches of Victoria Park, suggesting the number of attendees could break the 2012 record of 180,000.The streets leading to the park were lined with pro-democracy stalls and demonstrators handing out posters and flyers.Audrey Eu, a former legislator and a founder of the Civic party, handed out flyers as young members addressed the crowd. “Even though they’re not yet 30 years old, they’re so passionate about it,” she said.Lee Cheuk-yan, a veteran activist and former legislator, stood on a stepladder at the entrance, thanking and shaking the hands of those who walked in.In April 1989, popular Chinese reformist leader Hu Yaobang died. Two days after his death, on 17 April, several hundred students marched to Tiananmen Square and laid a wreath to him. They called for greater freedom of speech, economic freedoms and curbs on corruption. The demonstrations spread to hundreds of cities.On 26 April, an editorial in the Communist Party’s People’s Daily denounced the student demonstrations as a ‘premeditated and organised conspiracy and turmoil’. The next day, tens of thousands of students in Beijing staged a demonstration to protest against the editorial. On 13 May, just two days before the arrival of Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev for a state visit, hundreds of students began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. The protests forced the cancellation of the welcoming ceremony. On 20 May, martial law was declared in parts of Beijing. Troops moved in, but were blocked by the civilians and demonstrations continued.In the early hours of 4 June, Chinese troops launched a two-pronged attack with orders to put down the protests. Armoured cars and tanks smashed through the citizens’ barricades. Some forty workers who went to plead with the soldiers were shot. On 5 June, an unidentified young man stood in front of a tank convoy leaving Tiananmen Square, in a final act of defiance. The actual number of deaths from the crackdown remains unknown, but it is believed the Chinese army killed at least 10,000 people, according to a secret diplomatic cable from the British ambassador to Beijing.Thirty years on, the Chinese authorities continue to view the Tiananmen protests as one of the most sensitive and taboo subjects. ‘June 4’, as the movement is commonly known as in China, remains largely scrubbed from official history and is censored from school text books and online. The authorities punish those who try to commemorate the event, and relatives of the victims who died during the massacre are barred from openly mourning their loved ones.Verna Yu in Hong Kong“After 30 years, there is still so many candlelight vigils … and so many people come out to fight for their rights, you feel hopeful. How can you give up when others won’t give up?” Lee told the Guardian last week.“The whole of China is silenced, and we have a window, or a loudspeaker for that in Hong Kong, to tell the world what happened.”Lee was a young labour organiser in 1989, sent to the student protests in Tiananmen Square with funds activists had raised in Hong Kong.“I heard the gunshots and saw the tanks rolling in, the rickshaws taking injured people,” he said. “It went from high hope to despair for me.”Lee was detained and forced to apologise before being allowed to return to Hong Kong, where he now runs the June 4th Museum. He says many visitors are mainlanders, and the museum has been targeted by harassment and vandalism.“When I came back from Beijing 20 years ago, people told me to make sure you tell the world the truth,” he said.As night fell in Hong Kong, thousands of candles flickered. People cried as the crowd joined in songs, before chanting slogans and the date of the incident. Footage of the massacre was broadcast on a giant screen and some turned away as the recorded sound of Chinese guns rang out. The crowd broke its silence to yell at an image of the then Chinese leader, Li Peng.Jimmy So, 60, and Chung King Wah, 70, said they had attended all 30 vigils since the massacre.“We want the Chinese Communist party to recognise the mistake of the June 4 crackdown and massacre, and we will come here every year until they do,” So said.Members of the standing committee of the Hong Kong Alliance laid a wreath and lit a flame of remembrance, and key members of the movement addressed the crowd in Cantonese, including the vice-chair, Chow Hang Tung, and representatives of the Tiananmen Mothers group.Lau Ka-yee, a core member of the group who is based in Hong Kong, said she could not visit China because of her activism, and none of the mothers had been able to attend the vigil.“They even can’t go out of their home in Beijing. Some time about May or June they have to leave Beijing to their home village,” she said.A proposed Hong Kong bill to allow the transfer of fugitives to mainland China, which many fear will be the end of Hong Kong as a safe haven, was a constant theme at the vigil.There are widespread fears the new law could be used to target political dissidents and attending the vigil may soon become too dangerous.Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy legislator, said: “It may sound exaggerated to outsiders, but if you look at China and how it practises its rule of law, if there is such a thing, it’s anything goes.”Beijing launched a crackdown before the anniversary, detaining key activists or sending them on enforced “vacations”.Hong Kong immigration officials also assisted, deporting on arrival an exiled dissident and a former Peking University student, Feng Congde, on Sunday evening.Regina Ip, a legislator, said she believed it was because Congde had intended to go to the vigil.“Hong Kong allows our people to hold the annual June 4 candlelight vigils. They have a right to express their views, to remember whatever happened 30 years ago,” she said.“But we don’t have to allow high-profile dissidents to come in and stir up further emotions. What’s the point?”Lee said Ip’s comments were ridiculous. “We can already stir up the emotion.

"As flights resumed at Hong Kong international airport, hundreds of travellers were still left with uncertain itineraries and little support from airlines as they struggled to make new arrangements.The airport was brought to a standstill a day earlier, on Monday, as thousands of protesters swamped its arrivals halls to protest against police tactics at demonstrations over the weekend, prompting the abrupt cancellation of hundred of flights on Monday afternoon.Hong Kong is home to one of the world’s busiest airports, with millions relying on the airport for connecting flights each month.The airport authority, however, and a number of airlines appeared poorly equipped to handle disruptions this week as almost all staff were sent home late Monday afternoon, leaving many travellers to fend for themselves when they landed.“We’ve pretty much had to do everything ourselves. They’ve given us two phone numbers which nobody picks up,” said Australian Kelly Venz who was flying through Hong Kong to France on British Airways when all flights were cancelledVenz ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport, where the only food available on Monday night were snacks donated by protesters.“I did have one [protester] come up and explain the situation to me, why they were doing it,” she said. “They also came around and were giving out food and water to everybody which was very nice of them, I suppose, given the circumstances because there was no staff here whatsoever except at the information desk.Venz said she was forced to rebook on a separate airline after paying £1,100 as the only British Airways flight available was on 18 August.Mohit Anand, who was travelling to Australia from India with his wife Swetha when their connection was cancelled, said they were still uncertain as to when their flight on Qantas had even been rescheduled on Tuesday.The couple said Qantas had failed to answer any telephone calls and they had been waiting since morning for the service desk to reopen at 5pm.“All they did was give us a piece of paper and say call us. We’ve been doing this since yesterday,” Anand said.Russian tourist Maria Loznevaya said her flight to Hong Kong had been delayed for eight hours from Dubai due to the protests, but seemed somewhat sympathetic with the protests.“We understand the protesters because we have protests in Moscow too and we understand the situation,” she said, referring to peaceful demonstrations in Russia that have also ended in chaos and police violence over the summer.Sympathy with protesters, who plastered the arrivals and departures hall in information about the city’s recent protest movement, was not universal amongst stranded travellers.On Monday night, one Australian man was filmed arguing with protesters about the disruptions they had caused. He told protesters the Hong Kong police “should actually not be restrained” due to the conduct of protesters, according to the footage.",'Nobody picks up the phone': stranded Hong Kong travellers bemoan airlines,2019-08-13/09:44:26,as flights resumed at hong kong international airport hundreds of travellers were still left with uncertain itineraries and little support from airlines as they struggled to make new arrangements the airport was brought to a standstill a day earlier on monday as thousands of protesters swamped its arrivals halls to protest against police tactics at demonstrations over the weekend prompting the abrupt cancellation of hundred of flights on monday afternoon hong kong is home to one of the world s busiest airports with millions relying on the airport for connecting flights each month the airport authority however and a number of airlines appeared poorly equipped to handle disruptions this week as almost all staff were sent home late monday afternoon leaving many travellers to fend for themselves when they landed we ve pretty much had to do everything ourselves they ve given us two phone numbers which nobody picks up said australian kelly venz who was flying through hong kong to france on british airways when all flights were cancelledvenz ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport where the only food available on monday night were snacks donated by protesters i did have one protester come up and explain the situation to me why they were doing it she said they also came around and were giving out food and water to everybody which was very nice of them i suppose given the circumstances because there was no staff here whatsoever except at the information desk venz said she was forced to rebook on a separate airline after paying   as the only british airways flight available was on  august mohit anand who was travelling to australia from india with his wife swetha when their connection was cancelled said they were still uncertain as to when their flight on qantas had even been rescheduled on tuesday the couple said qantas had failed to answer any telephone calls and they had been waiting since morning for the service desk to reopen at pm all they did was give us a piece of paper and say call us we ve been doing this since yesterday anand said russian tourist maria loznevaya said her flight to hong kong had been delayed for eight hours from dubai due to the protests but seemed somewhat sympathetic with the protests we understand the protesters because we have protests in moscow too and we understand the situation she said referring to peaceful demonstrations in russia that have also ended in chaos and police violence over the summer sympathy with protesters who plastered the arrivals and departures hall in information about the city s recent protest movement was not universal amongst stranded travellers on monday night one australian man was filmed arguing with protesters about the disruptions they had caused he told protesters the hong kong police should actually not be restrained due to the conduct of protesters according to the footage ,Hong Kong Protests,0.183423862
"Joshua Wong was a key student leader during pro-democracy protests in 2014 that paralysed parts of Hong Kong for 70 days in what came to be known as the “umbrella movement”.He became the face of Hong Kong’s democracy movement and was imprisoned for two months for his involvement in those protests.He was released from prison on 17 June, four days before the protests in Hong Kong in which demonstrators surrounded police headquarters. He was charged on Friday over his involvement.Wong, 22, is the co-founder of the political group Demosistō. Netflix made a documentary about him titled Joshua: Teenager vs Superpower.He was charged on Friday with offences including organising an unlawful assembly and released.Agnes Chow is, like Wong, a former student leader of the umbrella movement in 2014.She belongs to the political organisation Demosistō, and was arrested on Monday morning on suspicion of “inciting others to participate in an unauthorised assembly” as well as “knowingly participating in an unauthorised assembly” during protests outside police headquarters on 21 June.Chow, 22, was blocked from running for political office in Hong Kong in 2018 because of her party’s pro-democracy manifesto.Chow renounced her British citizenship – a requirement to stand for election – and postponed her studies to run for office, but views neither as a sacrifice.“Many people may see this as a sacrifice, but it’s not for me,” she said. “I’m committed to fighting for Hong Kong and it’s nothing compared to those who have gone to prison.”She told the Guardian last year that she had grown up in an apolitical household where social issues were never mentioned. But when she was 15, she came across a Facebook post showing thousands of young people agitating for change – secondary school students just like her – and never looked back.Chow joined demonstrations against government plans to introduce “moral and national education” in 2012 – criticised by opponents as communist brainwashing – and it was there she met Joshua Wong.Chow recently travelled to Tokyo, where she urged the Japanese government to help put pressure on the Hong Kong authorities to withdraw the controversial extradition bill.Speaking in Japanese at the Japan National Press Club during her visit in June, Chow called on Tokyo to “pay more attention to this dangerous bill”, warning that it was not only Hong Kong residents who would be affected but also overseas visitors.Such visitors could find themselves being extradited to mainland China, which she described as “a place without the rule of law, without protection of human rights and freedom”.She was charged with offences including taking part in an unlawful assembly and released.Andy Chan, the head of the Hong Kong National party, came to international attention in September last year when his party was banned by the city’s security bureau for calling for independence for Hong Kong from mainland China.The bureau said the party was a threat to national security and the ban marked the first case of its kind since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997.The ban forced Chan to withdraw from public appearances but not before he spoke at a widely attended event at the Hong Kong Foreign

"HONG KONG   - Hong Kong Airlines shareholders have demanded to see 2018 accounts before considering providing at least HK$2 billion ($255 million) needed to ensure the carrier - part owned by the indebted HNA Group - keeps its license, two sources said. The demand came at a tense extraordinary shareholder meeting last week and at which former majority owner HNA did not speak at all, the sources said of the discussion, which has not previously been reported.  Shareholders questioned the airlines’ dealings with other HNA firms, including querying the prices paid to lease planes from affiliates as well as the cost of materials bought from them, the sources said, declining to be identified as the information was not public. Hong Kong Airlines said, as a private company, it does not comment on its financial activities. HNA declined to comment. Just weeks earlier, Hong Kong’s Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) demanded the airline detail plans to improve finances. ATLA declined to comment further on Friday. ALTA’s demand came after a travel insurer in January dropped protection against the airline’s collapse, prompting the airline to reassure customers it was operating as normal. A month before, the airline suffered a series of executive departures. Meanwhile, the formerly acquisitive HNA - a planes-to-banking Chinese conglomerate - has been working to improve finances since China cracked down on aggressive debt-fuelled foreign dealmaking began in mid-2017. At that point, a $50 billion spree had netted HNA assets including the single largest stake in Deutsche Bank. It has since been selling off holdings, including low-cost carrier Hong Kong Express Airways last month. At last week’s meeting, Hong Kong Airlines executives told shareholders that without fresh funds, the airline’s operating license was at risk, said the people familiar with the matter. Executives then discussed raising HK$2 billion via share placements, the people said. Such a move would significantly dilute the holdings of shareholders if they do not participate. Major shareholders include Chinese private equity firm Frontier Investment Partner with about 34 percent, and Zhong Guosong, a former executive and director of the airline, at about 27 percent. HNA cut its stake in the carrier two years ago and currently owns 29 percent through Hainan Airlines, its mainland flagship airline and China’s fourth-largest carrier. Meeting attendees demanded to see the airline’s accounts for 2018 including details of interactions with other HNA firms before considering whether they would participate in the share placements, the people said. The airline also told shareholders that it swung to a loss of about HK$3 billion last year, the people said. In 2017, it booked profit of HK$759 million, showed accounts for that year seen by Reuters. The 2017 accounts showed signs of rising financial strain, including a 50 percent jump in trade receivables - money due but not received - while revenue rose only 11 percent. Payments owed to the airline by HNA companies more than doubled to HK$1.3 billion, or 73 percent of total receivables.  The airline also held stock of four unlisted HNA affiliates, worth $367 million at the end of 2017, and had outstanding loans at that point of $300 million extended to two other HNA firms.

"The Communist Party has always been aware of the power of mass protests.Mao Zedong in 1930 famously used the traditional saying: “a single spark can start a prairie fire” to remind fellow Communists the power of strikes and uprisings when they were a fledgling opposition party under the one-party Nationalist rule.Today, Chinese leaders are likely to take a much grimmer view when they see images of millions protesting a controversial law in Hong Kong this month.Rocked by its biggest political crisis in decades, millions have thronged to the streets to protest a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told reporters last week that it was “highly alarming that Western forces have been stirring up trouble and provoking confrontation in an attempt to undermine Hong Kong’s peace and stability.”Casting protests as conspiracies fomented by “Western hostile forces” is a narrative that is not new for the Chinese government.The 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement, eventually crushed by the military, was labelled as a plot backed by Western powers to topple communist rule. The 500,000-strong protest in Hong Kong against a proposed subversion law in 2003 and the 79-day “Umbrella” civil disobedience movement in 2014 were also similarly blamed on “foreign forces” set to undermine China.Amid the recent protests, a Hong Kong representative to the Chinese parliament warned of “foreign forces’ interference” and warned people not to become “pawns” in the US-China trade war.“According to the Communist ideology, ‘We are the people’s representatives’, so the party cannot accept people rising up against it and forcing it to back down,” said Joseph Cheng, retired political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong.The authorities also have a deep-rooted tendency to blame problems on foreign interference instead of their own governance weaknesses, political commentator and veteran journalist Ching Cheong said.“China sees Hong Kong as influenced by years of colonial rule and having no sense of responsibility to introduce laws to protect the national security or to help the country nab fugitives,” said Ching. “And they believe that hostile forces are using ‘colour revolution’ to subvert China through Hong Kong.”Chinese leaders have many times warned against “colour revolution” – movements that lead to regime changes through non-violent resistance – and Chinese President Xi Jinping in January warned officials to be vigilant against political risks that could threaten the Communist Party’s rule.“The Communist Party fears mass protests,” said Willy Lam, a China expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who said Xi was particularly frightened of unpredictable events that could disturb the stats quo.After the current crisis, analysts believe the Hong Kong government will likely start a new round of retaliatory measures against its critics while the Chinese government will tighten its grip on the city.“They will definitely seek revenge, otherwise they can’t justify themselves as an effectual regime,” said Lam.Analysts expect that the Hong Kong government will widen the prosecution of people active in the protests. Last week, the police said 32 people had been arrested over the recent demonstrations and five have been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years’ imprisonment.Analysts also expect the government to continue weakening the pro-democracy camp by disqualifying more of its election candidates. Six members of the legislature have already been ousted and candidates seen as pro-independent have been prevented from running for public office.And Beijing will likely try to assume more power over Hong Kong, speed up its integration with China, and intensify ideological education, analysts say.“China will step up its intervention. Like after the 2003 protest, China will watch more closely,” said Cheng.At China’s behest, Hong Kong has already put in place a number of infrastructure projects that aid integration with the mainland, such as a bridge linking Hong Kong, Macau and Southern China’s Greater Bay Area, and a multi-billion-dollar high-speed rail linking the city and mainland cities. And more resources will likely be dedicated to initiatives to fuel patriotism, such as stepping up ideological education among youngsters, analysts say.Having antagonised not only the pro-democracy camp, but also the business community and even pro-government politicians in the recent crisis, Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam will lean even more heavily on her Beijing masters for support, Cheng said. “She will get even closer to China,” he said.But in the absence of any real solution to address Hong Kong people’s plights for democracy and more freedoms, these strategies will only deepen Hong Kong’s political crisis and more angry outbursts of discontent are expected on the streets.“The crux of the issue is that there is no democracy and there are no checks and balances so bigger mistakes will occur,” warned Cheng. “Conflicts will keep accumulating and one day these will explode.”",'They will definitely take revenge': how China could respond to the Hong Kong

"The British prime minister Theresa May has stepped into the growing crisis over China’s controversial plan to change the extradition law for Hong Kong citizens, by saying it was vital this did not breach the joint British-Chinese declaration, agreed at the time of the city’s return to China in 1997.In her first comments since protests started in the semi-autonomous city last week, the British prime minister said she was deeply concerned and the UK had a special responsibility to speak out in favour of freedoms in the former British colony.“We are concerned about [the] potential effects of these proposals particularly obviously given the large number of British citizens there are in Hong Kong,” May told parliament.“But it is vital that those extradition arrangements in Hong Kong are in line with the rights and freedoms that were set down in the Sino-British joint declaration.”1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, responded to growing calls to intervene by urging China to preserve a high level of autonomy in Hong Kong and engage in meaningful dialogue.With the UK possessing scant legal leverage over Hong Kong’s future, Hunt opted instead to urge China to recognise it was in its own interests to show restraint, in order to preserve its international reputation.“The ongoing protests in Hong Kong are a clear sign of significant public concern about the proposed changes to extradition laws. I call on all sides to remain calm and peaceful,” he said in a statement.Hunt also urged the Hong Kong authorities “to listen to the concerns of its people and its friends in the international community, and to pause and reflect on these controversial measures. It is essential that the authorities engage in meaningful dialogue and take steps to preserve Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy, which underpin its international reputation.”He continued: “Upholding the principle of ‘one country, two systems’, as set out in the legally binding Sino-British joint declaration, is vital to Hong Kong’s future success.”Hunt had already issued a joint statement with the Canadian government urging China to give the Hong Kong legislative council time to come up with alternative extradition proposals that maintained business confidence. There are fears the legislation could be pushed through within a week.Britain’s minister for Asia, Mark Field, told MPs on Monday that recent concessions on the proposed law fell short of protecting the city’s autonomy and judicial independence.“There are widespread concerns that fear of extradition to China might have a chilling effect on Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms and result in increased self-censorship … Hong Kong must enjoy the full measure of its high degree of autonomy and rule of law as set out in the joint declaration and enshrined in the basic law,” he said.“Many fear above all that Hong Kong nationals and residents risk being pulled into China’s legal system, which can involve lengthy pre-trial detentions, televised confessions and an absence of many of the judicial safeguards that we see in Hong Kong and in the UK.”Hinting that the UK could declare a breach in the joint declaration, he said the extradition bill came close to representing a breach, not just of the spirit but of the text.The last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, has said the extradition bill’s provisions are “a terrible blow … against the rule of law, against Hong Kong’s stability and security, against Hong Kong’s position as a great international trading hub”.","China's extradition law should respect Hong Kong deal, says May",2019-06-12/14:05:41,the british prime

"When hundreds of thousands of people have marched in what appeared to be the biggest protest in Hong Kong’s history, their chants of anger ringing from the streets, it sounds perverse to draw attention to what has not been said. But there are notable gaps and silences.The Hong Kong government has not said that it is shelving the controversial bill allowing extradition to the mainland – only suspending it, following the protests. As remarkable as Saturday’s U-turn was, that uncertainty brought still more people out the next day: 2 million, or more than one in four residents, claimed the organisers. Beijing is unlikely to want to risk another standoff in the immediate future. But previously apolitical sections of Hong Kong society have been radicalised by the threat and are making sure they are heard. They see the separation of the legal systems as the last line of defence for rights that they once took for granted.Yet protesters have not – with some striking exceptions – targeted Beijing. Though the fight is to protect the region as the Communist party dismantles its freedoms, signs have demanded the resignation of Carrie Lam, the chief executive trying to ram it through, instead of complaining about her boss, Xi Jinping. The retreat is a striking setback for China’s most powerful leader in decades. But, as opponents of the bill are aware, he might not have felt it possible had demonstrations focused on Beijing.Ms Lam has not acknowledged a single problem with the bill or heavy-handed policing, including the use of teargas and rubber bullets. She has shown spectacular political ineptitude and proved so tone-deaf that her apology angered protesters further. But Beijing would probably regard her departure now as a loss of face for itself.With all eyes upon the city’s streets, one key factor in this dispute has been little mentioned: money. The bill would allow mainland-initiated asset freezes, sending a chill through Hong Kong’s powerful and generally pro-Beijing business community. Tycoons have reportedly begun to move assets offshore. The large foreign business community is equally appalled. If their staff and assets become subject to Beijing’s rules, why not headquarter in Singapore instead?Beijing has not, until now, shown much concern for the potential economic impact of Hong Kong’s political struggle. But the region’s economy is intertwined with that of the southern Chinese mainland, and – with the trade war starting to hit home – leaders may well feel the need to tread more cautiously. The bipartisan support in the US Congress for a bill threatening Hong Kong’s status as a special trading partner will have underscored the risks.How events play out will depend upon Mr Xi’s rigidity or pragmatism as well as the determination and astuteness of those in Hong Kong. The extradition bill is a clear and open threat to the region’s way of life. But other issues are covert and gradual, such as the unlawful abductions which have already taken place, the cowing of the press, and the pursuit of punitive sentences for protesters as a warning. Some have already been arrested while in hospital, and though the protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, the labelling of a small amount of violence as “an organised riot” opens the way to far heavier sentences.Creeping changes have rarely proved as conducive to mass protest as the announcement of new laws. But Hong Kong residents will be wise to take greater heed of such gradual developments.",The Guardian view on Hong Kong’s crisis: the people have spoken,2019-06-17/18:39:49,when hundreds of thousands of people have marched in what appeared to be the biggest protest in hong kong s history their chants of anger ringing from the streets it sounds perverse to draw attention to what has not been said but there are notable gaps and silences the hong kong government has not said that it is shelving the controversial bill allowing extradition to the mainland only suspending it following the protests as remarkable as saturday s u turn was that uncertainty brought still more people out the next day  million or more than one in four residents claimed the organisers beijing is unlikely to want to risk another standoff in the immediate future but previously apolitical sections of hong kong society have been radicalised by the threat and are making sure they are heard they see the separation of the legal systems as the last line of defence for rights that they once took for granted yet protesters have not with some striking exceptions targeted beijing though the fight is to protect the region as the communist party dismantles its freedoms signs have demanded the resignation of carrie lam the chief executive trying to ram it through instead of complaining about her boss xi jinping the retreat is a striking setback for china s most powerful leader in decades but as opponents of the bill are aware he might not have felt it possible had demonstrations focused on beijing ms lam has not acknowledged a single problem with the bill or heavy handed policing including the use of teargas and rubber bullets she has shown spectacular political ineptitude and proved so tone deaf that her apology angered protesters further but beijing would probably regard her departure now as a loss of face for itself with all eyes upon the city s streets one key factor in this dispute has been little mentioned money the bill would allow mainland initiated asset freezes sending a chill through hong kong s powerful and generally pro beijing business community tycoons have reportedly begun to move assets offshore the large foreign business community is equally appalled if their staff and assets become subject to beijing s rules why not headquarter in singapore instead beijing has not until now shown much concern for the potential economic impact of hong kong s political struggle but the region s economy is intertwined with that of the southern chinese mainland and with the trade war starting to hit home leaders may well feel the need to tread more cautiously the bipartisan support in the us congress for a bill threatening hong kong s status as a special trading partner will have underscored the risks how events play out will depend upon mr xi s rigidity or pragmatism as well as the determination and astuteness of those in hong kong the extradition bill is a clear and open threat to the region s way of life but other issues are covert and gradual such as the unlawful abductions which have already taken place the cowing of the press and the pursuit of punitive sentences for protesters as a warning some have already been arrested while in hospital and though the protests were overwhelmingly peaceful the labelling of a small amount of violence as an organised riot opens the way to far heavier sentences creeping changes have rarely proved as conducive to mass protest as the announcement of new laws but hong kong residents will be wise to take greater heed of such gradual developments ,Hong Kong Protests,0.181266189
"The pressure of Hong Kong public opinion against a proposed extradition law appears to be causing cracks in the unity of pro-Beijing leaders after two senior figures called for the legislation to be delayed or dropped.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has staked her authority on pushing through the legislation, vowing not to back down during a week in which protests have convulsed the city. She has compared demonstrators who were pelted with rubber bullets and teargas to spoilt children.But one of her senior advisers, an influential pro-Beijing politician, said on Friday the bill would have to be delayed, while a senior Chinese diplomat attempted to distance Beijing from the law.Bernard Chan, a top aide to Lam, admitted he had underestimated the opposition of the business community to the new law. “I think it is impossible to discuss [it] under such confrontation. It would be very difficult,” Chan told RTHK radio. “At the very least we should not escalate the antagonism.”Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing legislator, also called for a delay in a long Facebook post in which he said the “bloody conflict” of recent days had left him “heartbroken”.“I hope the government will delay the discussions of the bill at the Legislative Council,” he said, adding that a delay should be seen as responsible politics rather than a sign of caving in to pressure.Lam has not made any statements since Wednesday’s crackdown on protesters. Another opposition march has been called for Sunday.The legislation was ostensibly proposed to allow the extradition to Taiwan of a Hong Kong man accused of murdering his girlfriend on the self-governing island. Lam says she has promised the woman’s family justice.But the bill’s many critics say it is a dangerously open-ended piece of legislation that will destroy the foundations of Hong Kong society by allowing China to target political enemies and try them in China’s opaque courts, where the conviction rate is as high as 99%.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongThe end of a judicial “firewall” around the city would put businesspeople as well as dissidents at risk, and the plan has caused widespread unease inside Hong Kong. There have even been rare strikes to support protesters in the street.Taiwan has expressed worries that the law undermines its own sovereignty and has pledged not to use it. That effectively removes Lam’s main justification for passing the legislation, which critics say was always really aimed at satisfying Beijing.In a sign that Chinese authorities may now also be concerned about the growth of public opposition in Hong Kong, China’s ambassador to the UK attempted to distance his government from the law.He said in an interview that the bill had not been introduced at China’s request, although he stopped short of calling on Lam to drop the legislation.“[The] Beijing central government gave no instruction, no order about making [the] amendment,” Liu Xiaoming told the BBC.. “This amendment was initiated by the Hong Kong government, it was prompted by a murder case in Taiwan.”A group claimed to be organising grassroots support for the extradition law abruptly cancelled plans for a media briefing and march on Sunday, RTHK reported.Safeguard HK claims it has more than 900,000 signatures on a petition backing the law, but said it would no longer organise a march “to avoid possible conflicts”. Critics say the number of signatures on the petition has been artificially boosted.Not all support for the legislation has evaporated. Regina Ip, a hardline politician and former security bureau chief, was among those insisting the government should press ahead.Opposition protesters said it was far too early to claim victory. “I’m not sure [Chan and Tien] are concerned about the public demonstrations,” said a student who asked to be named only as Mandy. “They are just worried about their own interests and now they think those may be under threat.” Hundreds of people joined a “mothers against extradition” demonstration near the city centre on Friday, a show of commitment as some of the bill’s backers waver.“We still have hope,” Mandy said of efforts to halt the bill. “If we keep faith, it may still happen.”",Adviser to Hong Kong leader calls for extradition bill delay,2019-06-14/14:24:08,the pressure of hong kong

"Five years ago, when Hong Kong residents flooded the streets to demand true democracy, the movement was named Occupy Central With Love and Peace. On Monday, as a group of protesters overran the region’s legislature, a banner hung outside carried a harsher, more pessimistic message borrowed from the Hunger Games films: “If we burn, you burn with us.”Half a million had peacefully marched against the extradition bill that day. Even the splinter group who broke into the building, spray-painted slogans and hung the British colonial-era flag had their limits. They put up signs urging others not to damage antiques and left cash for drinks from the cafe. Force was directed at property rather than people. But the angry, destructive scenes nonetheless reflect a hardening of feeling.The occupation and vandalism will alienate some ordinary residents as well as risking retaliation. One pro-democracy legislator described the ease with which protesters gained entry as a trap; there are fears that it plays into the hands of the Chinese government, which has already described events as “intolerable”.Yet many of those who opposed the takeover, and in some cases tried to physically prevent it as police stood aside, nonetheless blame authorities rather than those who stormed the building. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, halted the new legislation after huge demonstrations, but her refusal to withdraw it or to apologise for harsh policing (including the firing of teargas and rubber bullets and beating of protesters posing no apparent threat) has fuelled the anger and sense of hopelessness. “We already tried everything else,” the activist Joshua Wong wrote on Twitter. He was not among those who broke in.When Hong Kong was returned to China 22 years ago this week, Beijing promised that the region’s way of life would be safeguarded until 2047. But hopes that the mainland would become more like Hong Kong were destroyed long ago. Beijing has made clear its determination to bend the region to its increasingly repressive will. Residents have seen the attempts to push through anti-sedition laws and patriotic education; the harsh sentences for protest leaders and activists; the disqualification of pro-democracy legislators; the muzzling of the region’s media. If the unease in 1997 was prompted by uncertainty, one analyst observed, some of it now comes from certainty.Jeremy Hunt’s clear support for Hong Kong’s freedoms is welcome after the muted approach of previous foreign secretaries. Britain has a particular duty as the other signatory of the legally binding treaty on the region, which Beijing has dismissed. But it is Hong Kong’s residents who are rallying as never before to defend their rights.As many as one in four turned out to oppose the bill allowing people to be extradited to the mainland, many regarding it as the last line of defence for the region’s freedoms. The proportion of residents feeling proud to have become citizens of China has plunged to a quarter, the lowest since the handover. Only two in five are confident in the region’s future. One in six now support independence, even if few think it possible.The trade war has made Beijing more anxious than usual about disrupting Hong Kong’s economy, but this is merely a question of patience: in the end, politics trump economics for the Communist party. The underlying dilemma has not changed. Do nothing, and the encroachments will continue; resist, and prompt retaliation.That fear of retaliation has shaped this leaderless movement, whose advantages are real but whose perils are equally evident. Its participants are drawing different conclusions from the same underlying calculation: Hong Kong cannot overturn this dynamic. The question is how best to prolong it, hoping that China one day changes.",The Guardian view on Hong Kong’s protests: the mood hardens,2019-07-02/18:51:39,five years ago when hong kong residents flooded the streets to demand true democracy the movement was named occupy central with love and peace on monday as a group of protesters overran the region s legislature a banner hung outside carried a harsher more pessimistic message borrowed from the hunger games films if we burn you burn with us half a million had peacefully marched against the extradition bill that day even the splinter group who broke into the building spray painted slogans and hung the british colonial era flag had their limits they put up signs urging others not to damage antiques and left cash for drinks from the cafe force was directed at property rather than people but the angry destructive scenes nonetheless reflect a hardening of feeling the occupation and vandalism will alienate some ordinary residents as well as risking retaliation one pro democracy legislator described the ease with which protesters gained entry as a trap there are fears that it plays into the hands of the chinese government which has already described events as intolerable yet many of those who opposed the takeover and in some cases tried to physically prevent it as police stood aside nonetheless blame authorities rather than those who stormed the building hong kong s chief executive carrie lam halted the new legislation after huge demonstrations but her refusal to withdraw it or to apologise for harsh policing including the firing of teargas and rubber bullets and beating of protesters posing no apparent threat has fuelled the anger and sense of hopelessness we already tried everything else the activist joshua wong wrote on twitter he was not among those who broke in when hong kong was returned to china  years ago this week beijing promised that the region s way of life would be safeguarded until  but hopes that the mainland would become more like hong kong were destroyed long ago beijing has made clear its determination to bend the region to its increasingly repressive will residents have seen the attempts to push through anti sedition laws and patriotic education the harsh sentences for protest leaders and activists the disqualification of pro democracy legislators the muzzling of the region s media if the unease in  was prompted by uncertainty one analyst observed some of it now comes from certainty jeremy hunt s clear support for hong kong s freedoms is welcome after the muted approach of previous foreign secretaries britain has a particular duty as the other signatory of the legally binding treaty on the region which beijing has dismissed but it is hong kong s residents who are rallying as never before to defend their rights as many as one in four turned out to oppose the bill allowing people to be extradited to the mainland many regarding it as the last line of defence for the region s freedoms the proportion of residents feeling proud to have become citizens of china has plunged to a quarter the lowest since the handover only two in five are confident in the region s future one in six now support independence even if few think it possible the trade war has made beijing more anxious than usual about disrupting hong kong s economy but this is merely a question of patience in the end politics trump economics for the communist party the underlying dilemma has not changed do nothing and the encroachments will continue resist and prompt retaliation that fear of retaliation has shaped this leaderless movement whose advantages are real but whose perils are equally evident its participants are drawing different conclusions from the same underlying calculation hong kong cannot overturn this dynamic the question is how best to prolong it hoping that china one day changes ,Hong Kong Protests,0.178932637
"Carrie Lam’s announcement that a controversial extradition bill had been suspended reinforced the Hong Kong chief executive’s reputation as a hard-nosed leader who can “put up a good fight”.Throughout her press conference on Saturday, Lam adopted a resolute, unapologetic and defensive tone that her critics labelled arrogant and insincere.In her opening speech, she stuck to her justification of the bill, insisting it was to seek justice for a young Hong Kong woman murdered by her boyfriend in Taiwan – a rationale that many doubted because Taiwan had already said it would not receive the murder suspect. She said she was acting out of “empathy” towards the victim’s family.Lam defended the bill as “a good thing” that would facilitate international cooperation in bringing fugitives to justice and said she was “perplexed by the extreme reaction” of people who opposed such a “laudable objective”. She suggested it was because they hadn’t examined the content of the proposed legislation.“To withdraw the bill will be erroneous. I cannot accept it as it’s a needed objective,” she insisted.Even while acknowledging that hundreds of thousands of people opposed the bill, which could result in suspects being sent for trial in mainland China, Lam insisted it was not the bill that was the problem, but the inadequate communication. And even then, she appeared to blame the opponents, saying she didn’t understand why the communication was not effective enough.Throughout the press conference, Lam was repeatedly asked whether she would still characterise the protests as a “riot” as she did on Wednesday after the mass protest assembled. After trying to dodge the question several times, she eventually said it was the police authorities who had dubbed it a riot and she agreed with them.Journalists also asked whether she felt compelled to apologise to the unarmed people who had been shot at by police with rubber bullets and teargas, and hit by batons, and whether she would consider releasing innocent people who had been arrested. She insisted that “everything must be done according to the law” and it was “only fair and reasonable” for the police to enforce the law. She argued that some of the protesters had instigated violence by throwing bricks at officers.Lam refused to apologise but said she was “heartbroken” over injuries among the police, before acknowledging that journalists and ordinary people had also been hurt.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. To a barrage of questions on whether she should resign over her decision to carry on pushing the bill despite the million-strong protest last Sunday, Lam adopted a defiant tone, stressing that she had served Hong Kong for 40 years and would continue to “use my experience to create a better future”.She thanked the pro-government legislators and those who had supported the bill, but did not mention her political opponents and citizens who had blocked it, and emphasised that it had only been suspended to restore peace.The press conference was stopped abruptly after 90 minutes; Lam simply walked out, ignoring dozens of journalists who continued to shout out

"It has been called “the nail in Hong Kong’s coffin”, a bill that activists say will “legitimise Chinese abduction” from the city. But the city’s legislators are pushing ahead with the controversial extradition law that will give mainland China the right to request the transfer of alleged criminals.Opponents have geared up for a fight, with a rally on Sunday expected to draw up to half a million people onto the city’s streets. The demonstration is supported by human rights and legal groups and the leaders of Hong Kong’s movement to preserve its tenuous grip on democracy.They fear the law, which will have its second reading before the legislature next week, will be used by Beijing to target its political enemies. It has prompted despair from many, who worry it heralds the effective end of the city’s independence from China.In its current form, the legislation would allow for case-by-case extraditions to mainland China and eliminate some oversight roles of the chief executive’s cabinet and the city’s legislative body. The legislature is seeking to pass it before the summer break in July.“All they need is a witness statement saying you committed some crime 20 years ago,” says Martin Lee QC, a barrister, former legislator and leading pro-democracy figure. “That is enough, and then you’ll be tried according to Chinese law in a Chinese court. And who can trust that system?”The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongCritics have accused the Hong Kong administration, led by Carrie Lam, of being “Beijing’s puppet”. But Lam’s administration claims the bill closes a legal loophole. It says the law – and the rush to pass it – is justified because of the case of a man wanted for the murder of his girlfriend in Taiwan.Hong Kong’s independent legal system was protected under the laws governing the territory’s return from British to Chinese rule 22 years ago and is seen by the financial hub’s business and diplomatic communities as its strongest remaining asset amid encroachments from Beijing. But the city’s independence – which is supposedly guaranteed until 2047 – has been slowly eroding, particularly since Xi Jinping took over as leader of the Communist Party in 2012.Last year, six members of the so-called “pan-democrat alliance” were expelled from parliament and pro-democracy candidates were disqualified from by-elections. Leaders and organisers of the 2014 pro-democracy protests that occupied parts of the city for almost three months have been jailed.These watershed moments, plus attempts to bring in national security laws, have created a citizenry hostile to any further encroachments from the mainland. The extradition bill appears to be the last straw. In Hong Kong’s parliament disagreements over the issue have led to literal blows.Critics say the law heralds the end of the “one country, two systems” policy, under which Hong Kong has prospered as an international business and finance hub.The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has expressed “serious reservations”, saying such measures “would undermine perceptions of Hong Kong as a safe and secure haven for international business operations.”Observers also worry about politically motivated arrests of foreigners. Following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Canada, two Canadians were quickly detained in China.In a joint statement, the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said they were worried about the potential effect of the proposals on the “large number of UK and Canadian citizens in Hong Kong”.The former British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, has warned that the law would be the “worst thing” to happen in Hong Kong since the 1997 handover. The law would “remove the firewall between Hong Kong’s rule of law and the idea of law which prevails in communist China” Patten said in video commentary posted online on Thursday. “An idea of law where there aren’t any independent courts, where the courts and the security services and the party’s rule, which are sometimes pretty obscure, are rolled all together,” he said, referring to China’s ruling Communist party.Ray Wong, an independence activist now living in Berlin, this week said it was “the nail in Hong Kong’s coffin.”“Because if this law is passed the legal system in Hong Kong will be destroyed. Hong Kong will be just another city in China,” he said.Claudia Mo, a pan-democrat legislator, agrees: “They are trying to integrate Hong Kong so much into the mainland to the point that Hong Kong is to be disappeared,” she says. “The little boat of Hong Kong is sinking fast.”China’s history of targeting dissidents on unrelated charges is well documented. In 2015, five booksellers who published salacious fictional material about China’s leaders from Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay disappeared from their homes only for some to reappear in mainland China confessing to non-political crimes like 13-year-old traffic offences.In 2008, journalist Cheong Ching was released after more than 1,000 days in jail for spying, in what he believes was retribution for writing an article critical of the Chinese Communist party.Ching says had they admitted the article was the motivation, there would have been an “uproar”.“[So] when the Hong Kong government says they aren’t going to send political prisoners to China, the problem is if China is making a request it will never be on political grounds.”Lee, who has been referred to as Hong Kong’s “father of democracy”, is an internationally recognised campaigner for the political freedom the city was promised after 1997. He predicts many businesses who have based themselves inside Hong Kong’s protective borders will pack up and go.“How can you do business in China by observing all the laws in China? There are too many restrictions, so you cut corners and pay bribes,” he says. But Pro-Beijing government members are resolute, and accuse the opposition of fear-mongering.Regina Ip, a legislator and cabinet member, and a former secretary of security, says the bill is intended to fight crime across borders, and that mainland China is Hong Kong’s most important crime-fighting partner because of high cross-border traffic by offenders.Ip has accused opponents of spreading “lies and falsehoods” about the new law and has dismissed concerns Beijing would abuse the system.“We’re not facing a situation where any ordinary Hong Kong person, because of some past dispute in mainland China, can be whisked across the border,” she says.“All the human rights guarantees are there.”Ip is adamant that the international outcry and the protest on Sunday – no matter how big – will have no impact. “If you cave in because of mass protest, that will encourage people to organise more protests on all sorts of China-sensitive issues,” she says.But opponents of the bill also believe losing the battle is not an option. “This is now I think the last fight for Hong Kong,” says Lee.The Guardian traveled to Hong Kong with the assistance of the Judith Neilson Institute",'The last fight

"Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has offered a “solemn” personal apology for the crisis that has engulfed the city since she tried to force a controversial extradition law on to the books.The leader of the semi-autonomous city also hinted on Tuesday that she had effectively shelved the legislation, but protesters criticised her as insincere and said she had ignored their key demands.In her first press conference since record crowds poured on to the streets of Hong Kong to denounce her on Sunday, the bureaucrat-turned-politician described going through an emotional time of “self-reflection”, and said she hoped to heal divisions that had opened up in Hong Kong society.But opposition leaders and protesters said that instead of defusing “fears and anxieties” that Lam acknowledged were stirred up by the much-criticised extradition bill, her intransigence risked inflaming them.“She is a walking disaster. She really did not respond to any of the demands,” said the veteran politician Emily Lau. Protesters want Lam to prepare her resignation, withdraw the extradition law, apologise both for police brutality at protests last week and for describing one as a riot, and to halt the roundup of activists.“What’s so difficult about saying ‘I will withdraw the bill’?” Lau asked, after Lam gave a complex explanation of why the legislation she suspended last month would probably never make it on to the books.She told journalists that after she suspended the bill at the weekend, it was likely to simply “time out”. The legislative session finishes in just over a year, and if the bill has not been passed by then it lapses and cannot be revived.“I will not proceed again with this legislative exercise if these fears and anxieties could not be adequately addressed,” Lam said. “If the bill does not make legislative council by July next year, it will expire and the government will accept that reality.”Beyond that partial concession, Lam offered protesters little. She said she would not resign, avoided questions about an independent inquiry into the demonstrations and said only that protesters who had not used violence would not need to worry about rioting charges, citing a previous statement from the city’s police chief.“It’s another bunch of rubbish,” said Freeman Yan, a protester. “She cannot hoodwink people with one lie after another. I don’t feel any sincerity. I don’t trust her. She can always revive the bill in a repackaged form.”People in Hong Kong are worried the law would fatally damage the city’s economy and society by allowing both residents and visitors to be sent for trial in China’s opaque, Communist party-controlled courts.A day earlier, Lam had reportedly told senior educators in private that suspension of the bill meant “total withdrawal”. But publicly using the word withdrawal, which was scrawled across countless protest signs at the weekend, might have been deemed too damaging for her crippled administration.Lam had already faced a humiliating climbdown on Saturday, when she announced she would suspend the bill and apologised for failures of communication, only days after she promised to ram it through the legislature.She insisted she acted alone trying to pass the law. But her efforts were endorsed by top Chinese leaders, and as Beijing’s handpicked choice to lead the city, her misjudgment has also damaged China’s autocratic president, Xi Jinping.He is likely to be profoundly disturbed by a massive popular mobilisation that could provide ammunition or inspiration to his enemies inside China or abroad.People came in record numbers on Sunday to march through the city centre, with organisers putting the turnout at nearly 2 million. Even Lam acknowledged that many in the streets were people who had previously steered clear of politics.Public anger remains high, and with protesters still furious, both Lam and Beijing will be weighing the political cost of further concessions against the political risk of inflaming tensions by standing firm.“[Lam] came out to apologise, but wanted to apologise without doing anything concrete. This is not going to satisfy anyone,” said another lawmaker, Charles Mok. “I keep getting messages saying she didn’t address what we were marching for.“We are discussing how to keep up pressure on her, most importantly not to persecute young people.”Some people were already calling for another march this week, but there are usually large demonstrations on 1 July, Hong Kong’s national day, and some activists may prefer to swell that crowd.“We are very disappointed and angry,” said Bonnie Leung, the vice-convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), which has helped organise the demonstrations. “We do not accept Carrie Lam’s so-called apology.”She said the group was still discussing next steps, but planned to open a formal complaint about police brutality and urged victims and anyone with photo or video evidence to come forward and support the case.In Britain, which handed the former colony over to China in 1997, Foreign Office minister Mark Field told MPs allegations of “inappropriate use of force” by Hong Kong police should be “fully investigated” by the authorities in the territory, adding that in the past the Hong Kong authorities had fined police that had over-stepped the mark, and suggested there may need to be reforms to the ways in which Hong Kong’s chief executive is elected and legislative council. But he warned if Lam were removed a more hardline figure might replace her.Additional reporting by Patrick Wintour",Hong Kong protesters unimpressed by Lam’s ‘sincere’ apology,2019-06-18/14:08:31,hong

"Imagine that 5 to 10 million Britons took to the streets to attack new legislation. Imagine that the previously cautious, passive or politically conservative came out, including lawyers and church congregations. Then imagine that – even with further protests pending – the government said they just didn’t understand the issue, and vowed to ram through changes within days.This is what Hong Kong has just seen. As many as a million residents, equivalent to one in seven of the population, marched against extradition changes. The turnout, astounding even to organisers, reflected the understanding that these amendments are the latest and most decisive breach of China’s commitment to maintain Hong Kong’s way of life for 50 years after its handover from Britain in 1997. By removing the firewall between the legal systems, the changes expose both Hong Kong residents and those who travel there to the whims of the Chinese Communist party, which controls the mainland’s courts and is handy at mustering convenient legal cases.The pretext for the changes is the need to address a murder case in Taiwan, which would not in fact be resolved by them. Whatever the Hong Kong chief executive, Carrie Lam, says, the assumption is that the extradition changes, which would allow the accused to be transferred to the mainland without legislative oversight, are designed to suit Beijing. Opponents predict the law will be used against critics, and potentially much more widely – perhaps against people caught in commercial disputes – and point to the cases of a bookseller and a tycoon who had foreign passports but were kidnapped from Hong Kong.On Wednesday, the protests will continue, with walkouts by school and university students, bus drivers going slow and a sit-in near government buildings. Hundreds of businesses, including bakeries and toy shops, have said they will shut. Most are realistic about their prospects of success. Last Sunday’s demonstrations were probably the biggest since the handover, and certainly since 2003, when rallies led to the shelving of draconian national security laws. But the protests are a sign of desperation more than hope: a visceral expression of fear, anger and pride in Hong Kong’s identity. Denied a meaningful electoral say by their very limited form of democracy, many want to vote with their feet. According to one survey, one in three Hong Kong residents, and one in two young people, want to emigrate, with political issues among the top push factors.Since Ms Lam insists this is a local initiative, Beijing could, in theory, shelve the proposals and let her deal with the consequences. In reality, this would allow Beijing to carry on abducting those it really wants, probably to minimal protest. Foreign companies would be reassured: Hong Kong’s economic importance to China is much diminished, but with international businesses unsettled by the trade war, it may be more valuable than in recent years.Under Xi Jinping the mainland has seen ever-increasing repression, and since 2014’s peaceful umbrella protests the Hong Kong authorities have made clear their determination to crush any sign of opposition. They have disqualified a growing number of candidates, banned a political party peacefully promoting independence, and ousted elected representatives. They have prosecuted dozens of pro-democracy leaders. Absurdly, a law professor who co-founded the 2014 movement has been sent to a maximum security prison. Independent bookstores have closed and others have stopped selling works critical of China. A draft law criminalises disrespecting the Chinese national anthem.Meanwhile, Beijing has shown its contempt for opinion in Hong Kong and abroad. It has described the legally binding Sino-British joint declaration on the return of Hong Kong as no longer of “any practical significance”. Some might conclude further representations are pointless. But Hong Kong’s demonstrators have made their stand regardless of the outcome, and they deserve support. Beijing’s attitude is all the more reason for leaders overseas, and especially in Britain, to urge it to respect Hong Kong’s autonomy in clear and forceful terms.",The Guardian view on Hong Kong’s extradition protests: an essential stand,2019-06-11/18:52:30,imagine that  to  million britons took to the streets to attack new legislation imagine that the previously cautious passive or politically conservative came out including lawyers and church congregations then imagine that even with further protests pending the government said they just didn t understand the issue and vowed to ram through changes within days this is what hong kong has just seen as many as a million residents equivalent to one in seven of the population marched against extradition changes the turnout astounding even to organisers reflected the understanding that these amendments are the latest and most decisive breach of china s commitment to maintain hong kong s way of life for  years after its handover from britain in  by removing the firewall between the legal systems the changes expose both hong kong residents and those who travel there to the whims of the chinese communist party which controls the mainland s courts and is handy at mustering convenient legal cases the pretext for the changes is the need to address a murder case in taiwan which would not in fact be resolved by them whatever the hong kong chief executive carrie lam says the assumption is that the extradition changes which would allow the accused to be transferred to the mainland without legislative oversight are designed to suit beijing opponents predict the law will be used against critics and potentially much more widely perhaps against people caught in commercial disputes and point to the cases of a bookseller and a tycoon who had foreign passports but were kidnapped from hong kong on wednesday the protests will continue with walkouts by school and university students bus drivers going slow and a sit in near government buildings hundreds of businesses including bakeries and toy shops have said they will shut most are realistic about their prospects of success last sunday s demonstrations were probably the biggest since the handover and certainly since  when rallies led to the shelving of draconian national security laws but the protests are a sign of desperation more than hope a visceral expression of fear anger and pride in hong kong s identity denied a meaningful electoral say by their very limited form of democracy many want to vote with their feet according to one survey one in three hong kong residents and one in two young people want to emigrate with political issues among the top push factors since ms lam insists this is a local initiative beijing could in theory shelve the proposals and let her deal with the consequences in reality this would allow beijing to carry on abducting those it really wants probably to minimal protest foreign companies would be reassured hong kong s economic importance to china is much diminished but with international businesses unsettled by the trade war it may be more valuable than in recent years under xi jinping the mainland has seen ever increasing repression and since  s peaceful umbrella protests the hong kong authorities have made clear their determination to crush any sign of opposition they have disqualified a growing number of candidates banned a political party peacefully promoting independence and ousted elected representatives they have prosecuted dozens of pro democracy leaders absurdly a law professor who co founded the  movement has been sent to a maximum security prison independent bookstores have closed and others have stopped selling works critical of china a draft law criminalises disrespecting the chinese national anthem meanwhile beijing has shown its contempt for opinion in hong kong and abroad it has described the legally binding sino british joint declaration on the return of hong kong as no longer of any practical significance some might conclude further representations are pointless but hong kong s demonstrators have made their stand regardless of the outcome and they deserve support beijing s attitude is all the more reason for leaders overseas and especially in britain to urge it to respect hong kong s autonomy in clear and forceful terms ,Hong Kong Protests,0.168251991
"Hong Kong has become a place whose present is unresolved and whose future is unimaginable. After the unexpected violence of the last week, no one can predict how the events of this afternoon, tomorrow, this week will play out. The only certainty is that Hong Kong’s way of life is under immediate threat and its people are coming out in force to defend it.But the curse of living in the eternal immediate present is that the stakes for this “last fight” could not be higher, especially since young Hong Kongers fear that if they are defeated in this battle, there will be nothing left to lose. The failure of the Umbrella movement five years ago, when Hong Kongers occupied important thoroughfares for 79 days, seeking greater democratic participation, to win any concrete gains has raised the stakes further still this time round.“HK is not China! Not yet!” These few words hastily scrawled on to a piece of A4 paper and tacked on to the concrete strut of a walkway aptly encapsulate the political crisis roiling Hong Kong. The territory has been plunged into instability after police fired rubber bullets and 150 rounds of teargas to break up a huge rally on 12 June, just days after a million people peacefully took to the streets to protest against extradition legislation.“Not yet” is a reference to the terms of the joint declaration governing Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule in 1997, which promised that the territory’s way of life would remain unchanged for 50 years, until 2047. When it was signed, in 1984, the year 2047 seemed impossibly far off, but the proposed extradition law brings 2047 much, much closer.By permitting the rendition of anyone on Hong Kong soil to face trial in China, it would effectively remove the firewall between Hong Kong’s common law system and the mainland’s party-dominated legal system. Though the government has now suspended the bill, the process has unleashed a firestorm of fear and anger.Since the Umbrella movement, Hong Kongers have already seen irrevocable changes to their way of life: popularly elected lawmakers have been disqualified by the courts for saying their oaths too slowly or with the wrong intonation; politicians have been forbidden to stand for election; a political party has been banned; activists have been sent to prison on public-order offences; now the police have used violence against their own people.The unseemly rush to pass this unpopular extradition law has also weakened each of the territory’s institutions. The legislature descended into unseemly brawls, with fist fights breaking out as committees duelled. The civil service and judiciary are no longer seen as politically neutral. The police force, once seen as Asia’s finest, is an object of popular hatred, and its relationship with the public is irretrievably damaged.We don't have a grand strategy. In every situation, you just defend what you canThe chief executive, Carrie Lam, is so unpopular that protesters carried pictures of her face stamped with the word “Liar” and 6,000 mothers turned out to accuse her of not being fit for office. Even though the bill has been put on hold, the process has already permanently devalued the institutions that HK people hold dear.Hong Kong’s status as a city of protest is also under threat. The ability to demonstrate has become an important expression of local identity that distinguishes Hong Kong from China and over the years Hong Kongers have enthusiastically marched with performative flair, mounting shopping actions, carol singing rallies and artistic protests against censorship with blank placards. Yet the designation of Wednesday’s protest as a riot, combined with court verdicts finding activists guilty on public nuisance charges, strike at the very heart of the ability to stage a protest.Today, any call to public action, even the act of giving speeches to a rally, requires a greater degree of caution. The young activists involved in recent protests have switched tactics to form leaderless, anonymous collectives, hiding their identities with face masks and using messaging apps to organise. The government has begun to act against these, arresting one Telegram group administrator on suspicion of conspiracy to commit public nuisance. Many activists no longer welcome their photos being taken or doing interviews with foreign media. Within the course of a week, they are becoming as cautious as mainland Chinese dissidents. By shutting young people out of the political process, the government may well have created an underground resistance that sees that radical action can have results.But the core values that Hong Kongers cherish include universal values, press freedom, judicial independence and civil rights. These are seen by Beijing as among the “seven unmentionables”, putting Hong Kongers on the frontline of the clash between western “universal” values and the Communist party’s need for total control.Faced with these existential threats, Hong Kong’s default position has in recent years been a defensive crouch. “We don’t have a grand strategy,” the political scientist Ray Yep from City University told me before this round of protests had broken out. “In every situation, you just defend what you can the most. This is how you defend Hong Kong values. We defend what we have. It’s defensive but it can be offensive as well.” When one in seven of the population turns out to protest against the extradition legislation, defence becomes attack, particularly in the eyes of Beijing.The protest messages on the pieces of paper flapping on the overhead walkway underline the confusion, shock and anger reverberating through the territory in the wake of last week’s violence. “Stop shooting students.” “Is protesting a crime?” “Is speaking a crime?”But equally, there’s a flinty determination that underpins the realisation that, even if this struggle over the extradition law is won, there will be the next fight, then the next. Because Hong Kong is not China yet. Not yet, but 2047 moves ever closer at an accelerating pace. One message simply said: “Keep going till the end.”Louisa Lim is the author of The People’s Republic of Amnesia","Hong Kong is not China yet, but that feared day is coming ever

"The ninth of June 2019 was a Sunday. Any other Sunday in summer at Causeway Bay, Hong Kong, old men and women would do their usual walkabouts and maids would gather, spread out groundsheets, cover them with spicy delicacies and listen to Filipino pop songs. But it was not like any other Sunday, at least not for me. Filled with anxiety, hope and anger, I joined the protest against Hong Kong’s proposed extradition law, alongside three classmates from my evening Spanish class. We were hopeful because perhaps there was a slim chance that our government would listen to us, for once. We were angry because our government had repeatedly lied to us.I had not taken part in any demonstrations since 2004, at which time I still had not yet completely lost faith in the sincerity of China’s promise of democracy for Hong Kong. But this time I just felt I had to.We were anxious that if we did not stop the impending extradition bill, all foreign firms and multinationals would leave Hong Kong in droves, property prices and the stock market would plummet and lots of people would be without jobs or worse. It all started in 1997, when the sovereignty of Hong Kong was returned to Beijing. We were promised a high degree of autonomy with a democratically elected legislature and a chief executive. After 22 years, there is still no sign of a legislature elected by universal suffrage, promised to us under the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s constitution. It’s bad enough not to have a completely elected legislature and an elected chief executive. Worse, it now looks as if our chief executive, Carrie Lam, appointed by Beijing in 2017, will bulldoze through our legislature laws, which will authorise our courts to sanction the extradition of any person, of whatever nationality, to China if the PRC authorities deliver official papers to the Hong Kong courts alleging that they have committed one of the scheduled list of crimes in the PRC.Not only that, the proposed bill will allow the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government to freeze the assets of anyone falling within the definition of a PRC crime suspect. What makes me even more angry is that our chief executive and our secretary for justice, Teresa Cheng, have openly misled the ordinary people of Hong Kong, effectively saying that anyone who objects to the proposed law does not really understand what it is all about.The latter category of people includes 11 former and existing chairmen of the Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong. She claims that there really is nothing for the people of Hong Kong to worry about because our courts will ensure that everything will be done lawfully and that they will ensure that justice is done in the case of every suspect to be sent to the PRC. In fact, the court has no such powers. And by scrapping the second reading of the proposed bill by a committee of the legislative assembly and putting the bill directly to the legislative assembly for voting, Lam is breaking up a lawmaking system that has served us for more than half a century. Hong Kong will never be the same again if she succeeds. While marching under a 33C sun, taking just two or three steps once every 10 to 15 minutes or so, I saw numerous slogans on homemade placards criticising Carrie Lam, Teresa Cheng and John Lee (our secretary for security). Within an hour of the official end of the march, the government announced that our legislative assembly would discuss the bill on 12 June, as scheduled. All calls for a delay were ignored and more than two million pairs of feet appeared to have marched in vain after all. It’s business as usual at Government House and the legislative assembly, in which pro-Beijing factions have an absolute majority. Some protesters were furious and did some damage shortly after the march officially ended. Three hundred of them were rounded up and half that number were charged. Many groups have called a strike to stop the legislation going through. On Wednesday, the protests continued. The open space outside the legislative assembly was packed with thousands of people; police used pepper spray and teargas against some protesters; the crowd defended themselves with their umbrellas, goggles and masks. Protesters who attempted to march on Carrie Lam’s residence were stopped by the police. Lam used to brag that she has always been the “number one” since her school days. Now it looks like she’ll probably be remembered as the first in Hong Kong to provoke demonstrations on such a massive scale. It looks as if hellish days are coming. In what form, God knows.• The writer is a Hong Kong-based retired lawyer",Hong Kong is in danger.

"Tim Cook has written to Apple employees defending the company’s decision to remove an app used by Hong Kong protesters to coordinate movements and avoid concentrations of police.But the chief executive has been criticised for “taking at face value” the claims of the Hong Kong police, which don’t chime with the experiences of international observers on the ground.Cook wrote today to all Apple employees, defending the removal of HKmap.live from the iOS App Store. In the letter, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian, Cook says “these decisions are never easy, and it is harder still to discuss these topics during moments of furious public debate. It’s out of my great respect for the work you do every day that I want to share the way we went about making this decision.“It is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill. This case is no different. The app in question allowed for the crowdsourced reporting and mapping of police checkpoints, protest hotspots and other information. On its own, this information is benign.“However, over the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimise individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law.”But Cook’s claims have been disputed by those on the ground, who argue the violations described don’t match up with what the app displays. Individual officers are not displayed on the map, an online version of which is still live: only large concentrations of police are shown, with the stated intention of allowing protesters to avoid rather than confront law enforcement.Similarly, the app does not display areas where “no police are present”, since it only focuses on police concentrations that are large enough to affect protests.Charles Mok, a member of Hong Kong’s legislative council, wrote to Cook saying he was “deeply disappointed with Apple’s decision to ban the app, and would like to contest the claims made by Hong Kong police force.“HKmap.live helps HK residents, journalists, tourists, etc … avoid being hurt by teargas, rubber bullets, baton, beanbag round and water cannon that the Hong Kong police claims to be ‘minimum force’, and get real-time updates of public transport.Today I wrote to Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, to tell him his company’s decision to remove HKmap live app from Appstore will cause problems for normal Hong Kong’s citizens trying to avoid police presence while they are under constant fear ofpolice brutality. Values over profits, pls! pic.twitter.com/guaBfV8PnfIn its initial response, the developer of HKmap.live said Apple’s decision to pull the app was “clearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human rights in #HongKong”.Maciej Cegłowski, a software developer and activist who has been reporting from Hong Kong over the summer, tweeted that the claim the app violated the law was similarly unfounded. “Neither he or anyone else at Apple has specified which law this is. At a press conference today, Hong Kong authorities didn’t know either, and deferred all questions on the matter to Apple.”Others have noted the apparent double standards at play. A number of services, most notably the driving app Waze, prominently offer western users the option of avoiding police speed checks. Waze, a Google subsidiary, advertises the feature on the very first page of its entry on the iOS App Store. “Avoid traffic, police and accidents,” it says, with an icon depicting a police officer on the map.“I offer my sincerest condolences to @waze,” Cegłowski tweeted, “which unlike HKmap is an app specifically intended for evading law enforcement, and which by Mr. Cook’s logic must therefore brace itself for imminent removal from the App Store.”",Tim Cook defends Apple's removal of Hong Kong mapping app,2019-10-10/21:42:56,tim cook has written to apple employees defending the company s decision to remove an app used by hong kong protesters to coordinate movements and avoid concentrations of police but the chief executive has been criticised for taking at face value the claims of the hong kong police which don t chime with the experiences of international observers on the ground cook wrote today to all apple employees defending the removal of hkmap live from the ios app store in the letter a copy of which has been seen by the guardian cook says these decisions are never easy and it is harder still to discuss these topics during moments of furious public debate it s out of my great respect for the work you do every day that i want to share the way we went about making this decision it is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill this case is no different the app in question allowed for the crowdsourced reporting and mapping of police checkpoints protest hotspots and other information on its own this information is benign however over the past several days we received credible information from the hong kong cybersecurity and technology crime bureau as well as from users in hong kong that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimise individuals and property where no police are present this use put the app in violation of hong kong law but cook s claims have been disputed by those on the ground who argue the violations described don t match up with what the app displays individual officers are not displayed on the map an online version of which is still live only large concentrations of police are shown with the stated intention of allowing protesters to avoid rather than confront law enforcement similarly the app does not display areas where no police are present since it only focuses on police concentrations that are large enough to affect protests charles mok a member of hong kong s legislative council wrote to cook saying he was deeply disappointed with apple s decision to ban the app and would like to contest the claims made by hong kong police force hkmap live helps hk residents journalists tourists etc avoid being hurt by teargas rubber bullets baton beanbag round and water cannon that the hong kong police claims to be minimum force and get real time updates of public transport today i wrote to tim cook ceo of apple to tell him his company s decision to remove hkmap live app from appstore will cause problems for normal hong kong s citizens trying to avoid police presence while they are under constant fear ofpolice brutality values over profits pls pic twitter com guabfvpnfin its initial response the developer of hkmap live said apple s decision to pull the app was clearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human rights in hongkong maciej cegłowski a software developer and activist who has been reporting from hong kong over the summer tweeted that the claim the app violated the law was similarly unfounded neither he or anyone else at apple has specified which law this is at a press conference today hong kong authorities didn t know either and deferred all questions on the matter to apple others have noted the apparent double standards at play a number of services most notably the driving app waze prominently offer western users the option of avoiding police speed checks waze a google subsidiary advertises the feature on the very first page of its entry on the ios app store avoid traffic police and accidents it says with an icon depicting a police officer on the map i offer my sincerest condolences to waze cegłowski tweeted which unlike hkmap is an app specifically intended for evading law enforcement and which by mr cook s logic must therefore brace itself for imminent removal from the app store ,Hong Kong Protests,0.165057957
"The length of Hong Kong’s protests has become as remarkable as their breadth of participation. As many as one in four inhabitants have taken to the streets and this week – two and a half months after the movement began – it became the longest-running political protest since the handover. But the longer the demonstrations go on, the harder it has become to see a way out.This month, following the occupation of the airport, both police and activists stepped down their tactics. The resulting period of peace, which included a march by 1.7 million people, gave authorities an opportunity to look for a way out of the impasse. To no one’s great surprise, they did not take it. Though most protesters still shun violence, escalation has resumed, with a policeman firing a live round during clashes for the first time and some on the streets lobbing molotov cocktails.A ban on what was expected to be another huge march on Saturday has raised tensions further despite hopes that a compromise could still be found. Meanwhile, there are suggestions that authorities might invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, a colonial-era law giving the chief executive sweeping powers of censorship, suppression of publications and communications, arrests, deportations and property seizures. Rumours suggest the government may be testing the waters, with a view to specific actions such as introducing internet censorship. The spectre of a still grimmer outcome looms.Activists have diversified their approach to maintain momentum. Last week saw a 30-mile human chain. They hope to keep the pressure up with a class boycott when schools and universities resume next week and another mass event on the extremely sensitive date of 1 October – when the Communist party will celebrate the 70th anniversary of its rule.But the durability of this movement owes at least as much to its opponents as to its supporters. Despite the unfounded accusations of foreign meddling, this crisis was made in China. Authorities may have hoped that a campaign of attrition would gradually wear out protesters. But Beijing’s threats, Carrie Lam’s intransigence and tone-deaf public statements, and police brutality have so far fired up those already involved and brought more into the fold.A campaign triggered by the extradition bill has become far broader. More than three-quarters of the city’s population now oppose Ms Lam as chief executive – a record low for a leader in its post-colonial history. When campaigning for the job she insisted that she would resign if the mainstream view so dictated. Now she says it is her responsibility to continue to hold the fort which is disintegrating around her. She has made no concessions since announcing the bill “dead”, though even pro-establishment figures have urged her to withdraw it formally and hold an independent inquiry into the police handling of the unrest. The assumption is that the choice is not hers to make.

"Hong Kong is pushing forward with plans to change its laws to allow for the extradition of criminals to China for the first time, prompting widespread protests and fears for the territory’s judicial independence.Proposed amendments to Hong Kong’s extradition were introduced at the city’s legislative council on Wednesday, after thousands of demonstrators took to the streets at the weekend.The Hong Kong chief executive, Carrie Lam, defended the proposal, which would give her the power to order the transfer of suspects to China. Current Hong Kong law bars any renditions to China or other jurisdictions of the People’s Republic of China.“If you are of the view there is no independent judiciary in Hong Kong … it is nonsense … You are insulting ourselves, because we have set up a very independent judiciary,” she said.Democratic lawmakers shouted during the session and about 20 walked out, according to a legislative member who attended. The bill is expected to be put to a vote by July, when it is likely to be passed by the pro-Beijing-dominated legislature.Under the terms of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese control in 1997, the former British colony is meant to enjoy a “high degree of autonomy” from the mainland, with its own judicial and legislative systems. Critics worry the proposed new extradition arrangement would further erode the city’s rule of law and independence.The push to change the extradition law stems from the killing of a Hong Kong woman while on a Valentine’s trip with her boyfriend to Taiwan last year. The woman’s boyfriend, suspected of her murder, can only be tried in Taiwan. Because Hong Kong has no extradition agreement with Taiwan, he has remained in Hong Kong.Those in support of the amendments say they will close such legal loopholes and protect Hong Kong from becoming a “paradise for criminals”. A spokesperson for China’s ministry of foreign affairs office in Hong Kong said last month: “Cooperation against crime is a common interest in the international community.”But critics worry it will result in regular extradition requests from Beijing, which the pro-Beijing government would likely honour, according to critics.Eric Cheung, a legal expert at the University of Hong Kong, said: “How can you expect our chief executive to say no when faced by the central government?”Since the handover, Hong Kong has not allowed for the extradition of criminals or suspects to mainland China specifically because of the lack of legal protections for those tried in Chinese courts, according to the Hong Kong Bar Association, which opposes the amendments.Arbitrary detentions, forced confessions, torture, detention without trial, the use of trumped up or vague charges, and the denial of lawyers of one’s choosing are common in China’s court system, where the conviction rate is often as high as 99%.Cheung said: “There is no way the Hong Kong government or Hong Kong courts can ensure that the person extradited back to China can have a fair trial. How can we guarantee that the person will have access to lawyers? How can we ensure that this person will not be subject to violence or threats to coerce him to plead guilty?”The arrangement could make it easier for Beijing to seek retribution for cases such as the arrest of the Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada, at the request of the US, according to Dennis Kwok, a lawmaker with the Civic party.“What could be possible is that theChinese government will weaponise and use this system against foreign nationals doing business or passing through Hong Kong,” he said.Business groups such as the American Chamber of Commerce have said the law will hurt the city’s attractiveness to foreign businesses and investors. Human rights groups and media advocates say it will affect the city’s freedom of speech, a privilege Hong Kong media enjoy that mainland media do not.The Hong Kong Journalists Association said on Wednesday the changes would “not only threaten the safety of journalists but also have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression in Hong Kong”.",Hong Kong's push to allow extraditions to China prompts protests,2019-04-03/09:17:32,hong kong is pushing forward with plans to change its laws to allow for the extradition of criminals to china for the first time prompting widespread protests and fears for the territory s judicial independence proposed amendments to hong kong s extradition were introduced at the city s legislative council on wednesday after thousands of demonstrators took to the streets at the weekend the hong kong chief executive carrie lam defended the proposal which would give her the power to order the transfer of suspects to china current hong kong law bars any renditions to china or other jurisdictions of the people s republic of china if you are of the view there is no independent judiciary in hong kong it is nonsense you are insulting ourselves because we have set up a very independent judiciary she said democratic lawmakers shouted during the session and about  walked out according to a legislative member who attended the bill is expected to be put to a vote by july when it is likely to be passed by the pro beijing dominated legislature under the terms of hong kong s return to chinese control in  the former british colony is meant to enjoy a high degree of autonomy from the mainland with its own judicial and legislative systems critics worry the proposed new extradition arrangement would further erode the city s rule of law and independence the push to change the extradition law stems from the killing of a hong kong woman while on a valentine s trip with her boyfriend to taiwan last year the woman s boyfriend suspected of her murder can only be tried in taiwan because hong kong has no extradition agreement with taiwan he has remained in hong kong those in support of the amendments say they will close such legal loopholes and protect hong kong from becoming a paradise for criminals a spokesperson for china s ministry of foreign affairs office in hong kong said last month cooperation against crime is a common interest in the international community but critics worry it will result in regular extradition requests from beijing which the pro beijing government would likely honour according to critics eric cheung a legal expert at the university of hong kong said how can you expect our chief executive to say no when faced by the central government since the handover hong kong has not allowed for the extradition of criminals or suspects to mainland china specifically because of the lack of legal protections for those tried in chinese courts according to the hong kong bar association which opposes the amendments arbitrary detentions forced confessions torture detention without trial the use of trumped up or vague charges and the denial of lawyers of one s choosing are common in china s court system where the conviction rate is often as high as  cheung said there is no way the hong kong government or hong kong courts can ensure that the person extradited back to china can have a fair trial how can we guarantee that the person will have access to lawyers how can we ensure that this person will not be subject to violence or threats to coerce him to plead guilty the arrangement could make it easier for beijing to seek retribution for cases such as the arrest of the huawei executive meng wanzhou in canada at the request of the us according to dennis kwok a lawmaker with the civic party what could be possible is that thechinese government will weaponise and use this system against foreign nationals doing business or passing through hong kong he said business groups such as the american chamber of commerce have said the law will hurt the city s attractiveness to foreign businesses and investors human rights groups and media advocates say it will affect the city s freedom of speech a privilege hong kong media enjoy that mainland media do not the hong kong journalists association said on wednesday the changes would not only threaten the safety of journalists but also have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression in hong kong ,Hong Kong Protests,0.163445055
"HONG KONG   - An ambitious plan to transform the industrial towns of China’s Pearl River Delta into a modern economic zone powered by new technology ventures has triggered a rush of cross-border property investments between Hong Kong and the mainland. The promise of reduced investment barriers in the region known as the Greater Bay Area (GBA) has driven greater partnerships between Hong Kong and mainland property firms, who are looking to capitalize on a two-way rush for homes. In one direction, cashed-up investors from Southern China’s factory belt are moving into Hong Kong’s luxury apartment sector, where prices can be more than 100 times those on the mainland. In the other direction, Hong Kong residents are scrambling for bargains in mainland cities like Zhuhai and Zhongshan - some for quick profit, others a sea change. “Hong Kong’s housing environment is very cramped, while the mainland provides good space for retirement,” said H.C. Lee, a 47-year-old Hong Kong resident who recently made a HK$4 million ($510,000) profit on the sale of her Hong Kong apartment in the New Territories. She used half that money to buy two apartments, one in Guangzhou and another in the third-tier city of Huizhou. Her investment was also driven in part by expectations the commute between Hong Kong and Huizhou, currently about four hours, will be halved when a new rail connection opens in five years. Faster transport links to the mainland that opened last year, including the world’s longest sea-crossing bridge and a high speed rail, are boosting the area’s appeal as an alternative destination for Hong Kong property buyers. The plan to develop the area - which has a population of 68 million and a $1.5 trillion gross domestic product - will lead to an increase in such investments, say analysts and real estate agents. The scheme is part of Beijing’s plan to increase social mobility between Hong Kong and its hinterland and bring the restive former British colony deeper into its China’s political and economic fold. It includes major initiatives at the national, provincial and local levels. Some districts in Zhuhai and the third-tier city of Zhongshan recently relaxed home purchase rules to allow Hong Kong and Macau residents to buy new units. Previously, they could only buy second-hand apartments or commercial properties. More incentives, such as tax subsidies and healthcare and education benefits, are also being introduced by policymakers to lure Hong Kong people to work and live in the GBA. One Hong Kong investor, surnamed Lam, bought a 1.2 million yuan flat in Zhuhai in mid-May, her first in China. She hopes to use it as a holiday home and later sell it for a profit. Driven by this interest, Chinese developers are stepping up marketing efforts in Hong Kong, such as cold calls to prospective buyers, a tactic not commonly used in the city in the past. In one such call received by Reuters, Country Garden, China’s largest developer, offered a two-day tour of its sites in the GBA, with transport, accommodation and meals included. The price for the developer’s 35 square meter apartments in the third-tier cities of Foshan and Zhaoqing is about 315,000 yuan ($45,522.20). That compares with about $800,000 for a similar sized unit in Hong Kong. Promotional calls from developers Agile Group and Kaisa Group were also received by Reuters.   In recent weeks, Logan Property and Times China separately set up partnerships with Hong Kong realtors to promote their GBA developments. “We saw the demand, that’s why we’re doing more marketing,” said Ben Ho, general manager of marketing management at Times China, which set up a partnership with agent V+ last month. Property realtor Century 21, which partners with Logan Property, expects the market share of Hong Kong purchases in cities such as Zhuhai to double to 20% by the end of this year.  The GBA’s growing pool of capital, driven by a booming tech ecosystem that is tipped to one day rival San Francisco’s, is in turn finding its way into Hong Kong’s residential market, already one of the world’s most expensive.  Property agents in Hong Kong said more China money is flowing into the luxury market after a softening last year, and they expect this segment will outperform the market this year, rising by up to 20%. “Many bought on the GBA concept - they think Hong Kong has a lot of upside under the policy push and much tech talent and the management of unicorns will move to Hong Kong in the long run,” said L.S. Wong, Centaline senior associate director of research, referring to start-ups worth more than $1 billion. JLL, another real estate consultancy, expects Hong Kong’s luxury properties to benefit the most from the GBA, as the tech economy fuels the growth of ultra-high net-worth individuals in southern China, which has already increased 24% over the last three years to around 22,000. “Hong Kong’s high quality of medical services and education is expected to continue to attract mainland China’s ultra-high-net-worth individuals to move in,” JLL said.

"China’s ambassador to the UK has accused the UK’s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, of having a “cold war mentality” in his approach to the diplomatic row over Hong Kong.Liu Xiaoming criticised the Conservative leadership candidate for his stance of “strategic ambiguity” on the possibility of sanctions against China over the crackdown on the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.Last week Hunt stressed the UK’s “support for Hong Kong and its freedoms” after protesters broke into the territory’s legislative chamber on the 22nd anniversary of the handover of sovereignty from Britain to China. The protests are focused on a proposal to make it easier to extradite people to mainland China.Liu said China was “not interested in diplomatic war with the UK” over the former colony. Speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, he said: “We are strongly opposed to British intervention in Hong Kong’s internal affairs.”He continued: “We are still committed to this golden era between our two countries. But I cannot agree with some politicians’ description of the relationship, even the use of the so-called ‘strategic ambiguity’. This language does not belong to the vocabulary between China and the UK. It is cold war mentality language.”Hunt, whose father fought in the navy during the cold war, had used the phrase when asked to set out what the diplomatic consequences of the row with Beijing might be.“No foreign secretary would ever spell out precisely what would happen in a situation like that – you need what Bill Clinton called strategic ambiguity,” Hunt said.1 July 1997: Hong Kong, previously a British colony, is returned to China under the framework of “one country, two systems”. The “Basic Law” constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make Hong Kong distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China. 2003: Hong Kong’s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted. 2007: The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for Hong Kong’s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive’s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing. 2014: The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of “fake universal suffrage” and “fake democracy”. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of Hong Kong’s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015, Hong Kong legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party’s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites. 2019: Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill. The weeks of protests in Hong Kong have led to the territory’s leader, Carrie Lam, suspending the extradition bill and apologising for the way it was handled. Activists want it to be formally withdrawn and for her to quit. On Sunday protesters targeted transport links to the mainland.Liu was summoned to the Foreign Office for a dressing down on 3 July, the same day he used a press conference to lambast the UK government for its comments on the Hong Kong protests.Relations between London and Beijing have also been strained by the ongoing uncertainty over whether Huawei will be allowed to play a role in the UK’s 5G mobile infrastructure.The US has been pushing for allies to block Huawei, claiming it could pose a security risk – allegations strenuously denied by Huawei.Huawei is involved in building 5G networks in six of the seven cities in the UK where Vodafone’s service has gone live, even though the government has yet to confirm whether the company will be permitted to build the next generation of wireless infrastructure, the Observer reported on Saturday.It is also helping build hundreds of 5G sites for EE and has won 5G contracts to build networks for Three and O2 when they go live.Liu said he could give a guarantee that the firm would not pass secrets gleaned from the 5G network to Beijing. “I can promise that, 100%,” he said. “I think Huawei is a good company, it is a leader on 5G. I think if you reject Huawei you will miss enormous opportunities. They are here for win-win co-operation, they are not here to spy [on] people.”",Chinese ambassador accuses Jeremy Hunt of 'cold war mentality',2019-07-07/14:13:33,china s ambassador to the uk has

"Elisa Wong had always thought she would move away from Hong Kong when her seven-year-old daughter reached university age. But the recent political crisis has prompted her to reach for an application form to emigrate to Australia now.“I must put in an application as quickly as possible,” the 45-year-old former manager at a bank said. “It’s hard to uproot your family and start again in a new country, but the upheavals in the past weeks have made up my mind.”Hong Kong has been rocked by its biggest political crisis in decades in the past two weeks – millions have thronged to the streets in downtown business districts to protest a proposed law allowing for the the extradition of suspects to mainland China, where the Communist Party-controlled court system has a conviction rate as high as 99%.Many Hong Kong people were considering leaving before the recent political turmoil because of exorbitant property prices, high cost of living and notoriously intensive education regime. But the crisis which emanated from the controversial bill has stiffened the resolve of those like Wong to make serious plans to emigrate.According to a survey conducted in December 2018 and published in January by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, 34% of Hong Kong adults would emigrate if they had the chance. Among this group, 16.2% have already made plans to move. Those who wanted to leave were disproportionately young and well educated: 51% were between the ages of 18 and 30 and 47.9% had college degrees.Among those inclined to emigrate, three of the top five reasons for leaving were political: 25.7% said there were “too many political disputes and discord”, 17.4% blamed the lack of democracy and their dissatisfaction with the political system and 14.9% were dissatisfied with the Chinese government. Other factors were “crowded living conditions” (25.7%) and high property prices (17.4%).The three most popular destinations were Canada (18.8%), Australia (18.0%) and Taiwan (11.3%).Emigration is nothing new in Hong Kong. After the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration announced that Hong Kong’s sovereignty would return to China in 1997, emigration consultancy became a prolific business. The Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 spurred a wave of emigration, just eight years before the handover to China.The government does not keep official statistics on the number of Hong Kongers moving abroad but emigration consultants say that the desire to leave jumped after the 2014 Umbrella Movement failed to force Beijing to grant Hong Kong people an unfettered vote to choose their leader and spiked again this year amid the recent protests.Willis Fu of the Goldmax Immigration Consulting Co, says enquiries received by his company this year have doubled from last year. And the number of assessment forms it received – a measure of the number of people seriously looking into emigration – has grown from around 30 to 40 a week in March and April to 70 a week in June. The political mood in Hong Kong was clouded by the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown on 4 June and the extradition bill, which had been scheduled to pass on 12 June.I love Hong Kong but we have no other choice ... who would want to leave the place where you grew up?The political crisis this year is unprecedented in Hong Kong’s history: a million people are estimated to have marched on June 9, with hundreds of thousands occupying the main thoroughfares outside the government headquarters on 12 June later being dispersed by police with tear gas and rubber bullets. About two million marched again on 16 June after leader Carrie Lam failed to apologise even though she had suspended the bill.For Angel Chan, a mother of two preschool children in her 30s, the looming extradition bill, even temporarily shelved, still fills her with trepidation. The “mainlandisation” trend in Hong Kong, including the indoctrination of political ideology and the shift to use Mandarin rather than Cantonese for Chinese classes in schools, casts a shadow over her children.“You don’t know when they will bring the law back and it will constantly hang over us,” she said. “And what will happen in 2047, when our children are in their 30s? I don’t want my children to be in a place where there is no freedom of thought.”The One Country-Two Systems policy, put in place after the handover of sovereignty in 1997 to maintain Hong Kong’s status quo for 50 years, runs out in 2047. It is still unclear what Hong Kong’s status would become once that deadline passes, but the political crises in recent years add to the uncertainty of its political future.Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said even though the extradition bill has been suspended, “it won’t remove the anxiety because Beijing is determined to promote political integration between Hong Kong and China”. This includes infrastructure projects such as a bridge linking Hong Kong, Macau and Southern China’s the Greater Bay Area, a daily quota of 150 mainland Chinese migrants to Hong Kong, and the indoctrination of ideology at schools and the silencing of critical media.Lam said both waves of emigration, in 1989 and 2019, demonstrated “a serious degree of distrust of the Chinese Communist Party” and are linked with the fear that the Chinese system may encroach upon Hong Kong’s core values like the rule of law, civil rights and freedoms.Even young people active in the recent protests express helplessness and say they too would leave if their efforts to uphold Hong Kong’s current freedoms fail.“If there is nothing we can do to save Hong Kong, I would focus on working hard in the

"As pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong escalate, so does China’s fury. The unrest is now in its ninth week. It has evolved from limited, student-led opposition to a proposed extradition law into a broad-based, fully fledged challenge to Beijing’s rule. It is threatening to undermine China’s control of the former British colony and President Xi Jinping’s control of China. His quasi-dictatorial authority is on the line. A critical tipping point is in sight.How long before China’s tough-guy leader, accustomed to getting his way and not averse to using force, loses patience?How long before China’s tough-guy leader, a man accustomed to getting his way and not averse to using force, loses patience? How much longer can angry People’s Liberation Army generals be restrained? The Hong Kong garrison commander last week chillingly advertised his determination “to protect national sovereignty, security and stability”. And if a harsh military crackdown is ordered, and people begin to die in large numbers, what will Britain and the west do?These questions are critical, because the struggle over Hong Kong’s future has far-reaching international ramifications – symbolic, political and practical. The crushing of its freedoms would be a grim triumph for the advancing forces of global authoritarianism. The economic impact on already volatile world markets and trade, where Hong Kong’s role is central, could be massively disruptive. And it would raise fundamental questions about the Xi ascendancy and China’s direction of travel.If only for that last factor, it seems clear Xi will not resort to force, and de facto direct rule from Beijing, unless he feels he has no choice. He knows the outcome of such action would definitively give the lie to the favourite Communist party conceit of China’s “peaceful rise”. Xi knows the overseas repercussions could be immensely damaging, dwarfing in intensity the criticism of the abuses endured by Xinjiang’s Muslim Uighurs.But it is also clear that the fury and frustration felt in Beijing is close to boiling point. There have been dozens of official warnings in recent weeks about the necessity of enforcing a harsh policy of “zero tolerance”, and of how the protests challenge “the bottom line of the ‘one country, two systems’ formula”. With Hong Kong at a defiant standstill on Monday, the angry rhetoric took on an even more threatening tone.China’s outraged Hong Kong and Macao affairs office claimed, for example, that black-clad, masked protestors in Tsim Sha Tsui, in Kowloon, had flung the Chinese national flag into the harbour. “Their conduct has blatantly offended the state and national dignity … and greatly hurt the feelings of the entire Chinese people,” it said. “The central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue,” the Xinhua news agency said.The reappearance in public of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, after an absence of two weeks, may be significant. Xi and other senior cadres in Beijing have hidden behind Lam since the unrest began, letting her take the flak, even though, in proposing the extradition law and generally chipping away at Hong Kong’s freedoms, she has faithfully followed the party line. Xi does not want Lam’s resignation, because that would be seen as a concession and sign of weakness – and could expose him personally to political fallout. Instead, Lam was sent out to face the media on Monday, lacking new ideas about how to defuse the crisis and peddling an uncompromising message.“Such extensive disruptions in the name of certain demands or noncooperation have seriously undermined Hong Kong law and order and are pushing our city … to the verge of a very dangerous situation,” Lam said.This was no random choice of words, rather a script approved in Beijing. Xi did not reach the top of the pile by tolerating “very dangerous situations”. When all is said and done, his is still the unrepentant party of Tiananmen Square, ruling from the barrel of a gun.The potential for a violent Hong Kong security crackdown to trigger a truly international crisis is plainly growing. Jeremy Hunt’s embarrassing dressing-down by China’s ambassador, when he was foreign secretary, showed how little Britain could do in such circumstances – whatever the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration may stipulate. But as notional guarantor of Hong Kong’s freedoms and self-designated promoter of western democracy, Britain would surely be obliged to do something.Here would be yet another crisis for which Boris Johnson’s government is unprepared, and unfitted, to deal with. Has anybody in Beijing ever heard of Dominic Raab, Hunt’s successor at the Foreign Office? What chance a favourable post-Brexit trade deal with China in such tainted circumstances? A crackdown would signal the final demise of the already tarnished Cameron-Osborne “golden era” in bilateral relations, and with it all hope of significant, sustained Chinese inward investment.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongHong Kong could also prove a catalyst for a wider collision with Donald Trump’s United States. An unnerving confluence of events, including last week’s sudden threat of additional, punitive US tariffs and the ongoing row over American attempts to ostracise the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has already sparked a significant sell-off and instability in global financial markets.The Trump administration is increasingly at odds with China over its militarisation of the South China Sea, its ignoring of the US embargo on Iranian oil imports, its continuing support for North Korea’s nuclear-armed dictator, its so-called debt diplomacy in Africa and Latin America, and its “sinicisation” of religion, not solely in Xinjiang.China in turn accuses the US and Britain of fomenting the Hong Kong unrest and plotting against it. Add to all this Xi’s belief that quasi-independent Taiwan, armed and succoured by Trump, has been emboldened in its “splittist” tendencies, and it’s not hard to see how the building anger in Beijing could yet trigger a bigger, more dangerous detonation.• Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",The Hong Kong protests are putting China on a collision course with the

"China’s ambassador to the UK has been summoned to the Foreign Office accused of making unacceptable criticisms of the UK after a rare press conference in which he claimed that the British foreign secretary was backing law-breakers in Hong Kong.Relations between the UK and China cooled sharply after Jeremy Hunt called on Beijing not to use the protests in Hong Kong as a “pretext for repression”.On Wednesday, Liu Xiaoming said Hunt’s remarks represented gross and unacceptable interference, a claim that was dismissed by the Foreign Office as unacceptable and inaccurate.In a bid to underline British displeasure at the ambassador’s remarks, the permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, Sir Simon McDonald, summoned the ambassador for a dressing down.The sudden collapse in Sino-British relations – relative to the golden era hailed by David Cameron in 2013 – represents a personal test for Hunt as he makes his bid for the premiership, but it is also likely to have consequences for Hong Kong’s future relations with Chinese government.The past month has seen the worst political unrest in Hong Kong for decades, amid protests against a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist party.Earlier this week, protesters stormed the legislative council building and raised the old British colonial flag on the 22nd anniversary of the territory’s return to Chinese rule on 1 July.Liu told a press conference at the embassy: “I think it is totally wrong for Jeremy Hunt to talk about freedom – this is not a matter about freedom, it’s a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong.“It’s very disappointing when the senior officials of his calibre show support of these lawbreaking people. We all remember what Hong Kong was 22 years ago under British rule: there was no freedom, democracy, whatever.“We all know that all governors were appointed by the British government, people had no right to elect officials, no right to demonstrate, certainly, and they did not even have a right to have an independent judicial power.”Liu warned that Britain’s relationship with China would be damaged by what he described as the “interference” of the British government.“If the British government goes further, it will cause further damages, so that is why I’m calling the British government to reflect the consequences of its words and deeds with regards to Hong Kong. I do hope the British government will realise the consequences and refrain from further interference from further damaging the relationship.” Liu also complained that the British government had called on the Chinese government not to use the violence as an excuse for oppression when it was a matter for the independent judiciary in Hong Kong to punish the offenders, including those who had attacked the police with toxic powder.Hunt has adopted an increasingly outspoken tone of support for the demonstrators, who are demanding the Hong Kong legislature drop, rather than merely suspend, the proposed extradition law.While condemning all violence, Hunt refused to back away from the demonstrators’ cause after a minority of activists on Monday split from the main body of the protests to storm the legislative council.China has promised heavy retribution, and said that the wrongdoers would face the full force of the law. Twelve people were arrested on Wednesday by Hong Kong police and charged with a variety of offences in the vicinity of the council building.Responding to the ambassador’s criticisms, Hunt showed no signs of qualms over his stance, tweeting: “Message to Chinese govt: good relations between countries are based on mutual respect and honouring the legally binding agreements between them. That is the best way to preserve the great relationship between the UK and China.”His defence of legally binding agreements is a reference to the joint declaration signed by the UK and China to maintain Hong Kong’s way of life for at least 50 years after the handover. The joint declaration, signed by Margaret Thatcher and the then Chinese premier Zhao Ziyang, set out how the rights of Hong Kong citizens should be protected in the territory’s basic law under Chinese rule.Hong Kong has, since 1997, been run by China under a “one country, two systems” arrangement that guarantees it a level of economic autonomy and personal freedoms not permitted on the mainland.Geng Shuang, a spokesman for Beijing’s ministry of foreign affairs, said Hunt appeared to be “basking in the faded glory of British colonialism and obsessed with lecturing others”.“I need to

"Days after Hong Kong’s first major protest against its stalled extradition law, a property firm decided to take a £2.5m hit and abandon an option to develop a slice of prime city land, blaming “social contradiction and economic instability”.The decision by Goldin Financial Holdings was made after one of its directors, a pro-Beijing lawmaker called Abraham Shek Lai-him, called an urgent meeting to discuss whether to go ahead with the project on part of the old city airport.Shek had played a key role dragging the extradition law through parliament. He insisted after the vote that Goldin had a positive view of the extradition bill.He is part of a community that faces serious risks from the law – which would allow residents and visitors to be sent for trial in the mainland’s opaque, Communist party-controlled courts – and yet either worked hard to back it, or refrained from criticising it until mass protests caused an abrupt government climbdown.Hong Kong has built its reputation as an international financial and trading centre on China’s doorstep shielded from its autocratic government by the legal system set up by British colonial rulers.Its courts are considered independent, giving companies security to invest there, adding to its role as a regional hub. The possibility of extradition to China could transform that; its main rival as a base for foreign firms, Singapore, has apparently been watching events with delight as the Hong Kong government prepared to dismantle one of the pillars of its success.Ordinary citizens are well aware of the risks. As the popular uprising against the law thrust Hong Kong into the spotlight, much of the attention focused on how it could erode the city’s civil liberties and put dissidents at risk. But those who turned out on the streets were not only worried about freedom of speech and religion. Many said they feared for their jobs or their children’s prospects.The city’s business elite was not originally so bold. Many chose to stay silent even as concerns mounted at international firms and small businesses, and the city’s legal society made a rare intervention calling for a delay.China officially says the law is an independent initiative by the leader it hand-picked for the city, Carrie Lam. However Beijing’s enthusiasm for the law has been clear; some of the most senior politicians in the country have spoken out in support. And in late May, they summoned more than 200 pro-Beijing officials and business leaders to discuss the bill and seek support, the New York Times reported.But after years of comprehensive crackdowns on political opponents, including pro-democracy lawmakers, pro-independence politicians and the campaigners of the umbrella movement, the government clearly underestimated opposition to the new law.Protesters forced Lam – and by implication Beijing – into a rare reversal. And with the law suspended, a few members of the economic elite are starting to step out of line.Pro-Beijing legislator Felix Chung, who represents the textiles sector, warned in surprisingly blunt comments that the law could leave many of the city’s tycoons vulnerable. One of the offences for which extradition would be possible is corruption.“When we started to open up factories in China, the overall rule of law was not so mature. A lot of things had to be done by special ways, through corruption, bribery or whatever,” said Chung, who opened his factory on the mainland in 1993.Because the Communist party and the legal system are intertwined in China, it would potentially only take one falling out with a powerful official or Chinese business rival to put employees at risk.Cases like those of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor loom large for businesses with offices in Hong Kong, who worry the law could make them vulnerable.The two men were arrested in China on espionage charges. But Canadian authorities have denounced the charges as flimsy pretexts used to seize the men as part of a wider political dispute tied to the fate of a senior executive from telecoms firm Huawei.China has shown its willingness to go after enemies in Hong Kong without regard for the law; kidnapping dissident booksellers and a mainland Chinese billionaire tycoon and spiriting them across the border.The ability for Beijing to mount similar raids legally is a big worry for any business, and for anyone living in Hong Kong. Among the signs at recent protests was one that read “First: Canadians Kovrig and Spavor.
