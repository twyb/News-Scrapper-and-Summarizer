"Iran will further reduce its commitment to the nuclear deal signed with world powers by limiting international inspectors’ access to its nuclear sites, senior Iranian MPs have said.The move, which is expected to take place at the beginning of November, will be the fourth Iranian step away from the deal, and puts pressure on France, Germany and the UK to make some form of counter-move.The joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) was signed in 2015 but Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018, placing pressure on Europe to prove to Iran it was worth sticking with the deal.On Wednesday, the spokesman for the Iranian parliament’s national security committee, Hossein Naghavi-Hosseini, said: “In the fourth step of reducing JCPOA commitments, we will probably impose limits on inspections, which means the International Atomic Energy Agency’s surveillance on Iran’s nuclear activities will be reduced.”He added: “When the other party doesn’t fulfil its commitments, there is no necessity for us to meet our part of commitments.“We will certainly take the fourth step of reducing commitments to the JCPOA; Europeans have not honoured their part of the commitments and we have not seen any practical step taken by the other side.”On Monday the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said Tehran was working on advanced IR-9 centrifuges for uranium enrichment. Those centrifuges do not appear in the 2015 accord.The French foreign ministry publicly urged Iran not to take what it said would be “particularly worrying steps”.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentIran has justified the step by step reduction in its commitment by pointing to the EU’s inability to make good on its promises to increase trade between Iran and Europe. In July, Iran abandoned two of its commitments under the deal by allowing its stockpile of enriched uranium to exceed the 300kg limit and breaching the cap on the purity of its uranium stocks.The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, earlier this month told the French parliament’s foreign affairs committee it was up to Iran to pick up the proposals his country sought to broker at the UN general assembly in New York last month.He said: “We consider that these initiatives, which didn’t succeed, are still on the table and it is up to Iran and the United States to seize [them] in a relatively short amount of time because Iran has announced new measures to reduce its commitments to the Vienna accord [JCPOA] in November.”Tensions between France and Iran have risen after the Iranian intelligence agencies captured an Iranian exile based in Paris, Rouhollah Zam, who had led a media campaign against the government. He was captured in Jordan this week on his way to Baghdad.France has also disclosed that Iran has detained Roland Marchal, a senior researcher from Sciences Po University in Paris, since June.The tensions came as the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said one or more foreign powers were behind the missile attack on an Iranian tanker in the Red Sea last week. Despite the bellicose rhetoric, Iran is exploring if there is room for mediation with Saudi Arabia, after Donald Trump’s withdrawal from Syria and his refusal to take military action against Iran in the wake of the September missile attacks on the Aramco Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities.",Iran to limit inspectors' access to its nuclear facilities,2019-10-16/18:04:52,iran will further reduce its

"These past few days have been a watershed for Europe. I’m not thinking about Brexit, but about Syria – which increasingly looks like our 21st-century Spanish civil war. Western and European defeat in Syria (by which I mean political and moral, not just military defeat) has parallels with the 1930s when democracies were unable or unwilling to stand up to authoritarians when it mattered, or even to play any kind of meaningful role in preventing a catastrophe that would soon enough engulf them, too.Events in north-eastern Syria are obviously tragic, if not lethal, for the tens of thousands of people caught up in them locally. But they will also have an impact on Europe in more ways than we perhaps care to acknowledge. Donald Trump himself has said as much, casually pointing out that Islamic State-connected foreign fighters now on the loose would make their way back to Europe. He made clear that that is a problem Europe would have to handle alone. As bad as that prospect is, it is only one part of a wider picture that should make Europeans feel desolate: at a crucial moment in history, the Russia-Iran authoritarian axis is now fully victorious on Europe’s doorstep.Until Turkey launched its offensive there on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish. Since the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by Turkey and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.That leaves north-eastern Syria divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF – for now.On 17 October Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara’s operation for  five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdoğan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish “safe zone” in Syria.Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province. In late 2014, the Kurds were struggling to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside Turkey.Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF’s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump’s recent announcement that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.Erdoğan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this “safe zone”, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.Michael SafiBashar al-Assad’s forces, aided by Russian and Iranian military involvement, are now pushing north to retake territory that the anti-Isis western-led coalition and its Kurdish ground troops had managed in recent years to keep out of the Syrian dictator’s and his enablers’ reach. With Trump’s sudden decision to pull troops out, and the fast-moving events that ensued, Russia is losing no time moving in to fill the void. The Russia-Iran axis is empowered as never before, and that’s been facilitated not just by Trump’s recklessness and his “America first” doctrine, but by the division, confusion and inward-looking state of all our western democracies. The resemblance with the 1930s screams out at you.It’s true that Europeans are currently scrambling to cobble together sanctions against Turkey for its military onslaught against Kurdish-held lands inside Syria, but not much continental unity is on offer. Whatever pressure some capitals may muster looks unlikely to shape events. Nor do European governments seem in any position to effectively weigh on Russia as it wreaks yet more havoc in their vicinity. Essentially, Europe is the bystander in a nightmare it didn’t see coming, nor had the means to avert.If you think Syria is just a distant quarrel that we Europeans can easily turn our gaze away from, think again. The 2015 refugee crisis, in which Syria’s killing fields played no small role (with, at its core, a dictator’s strategy of turning his army against his own country’s population to hold on to power, producing mass movements of people) surely proved how badly European politics and our continent’s cohesion can be affected by chaos and full-on violence in its neighbourhood.Nor is the authoritarian axis just a handful of strongmen (Vladimir Putin, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan) playing power games across a limited geopolitical chessboard. The victory they are in the process of clinching sends a much larger message about how fast an entire world system can come undone – a world in which Europeans could still hope that some principles, such as a basic observance of alliances, might still bear a degree of importance.It may not be too soon to draw a few lessons from what’s unfolding. With Trump’s sellout of allies in Syria, US security guarantees to Europe as we’ve known them are fast evaporating before our eyes. Trump’s move has given new meaning to what we already knew about his overall disdain for Nato. Be sure that little of this will have been lost on authoritarian leaders who believe their global time has come and that all they need to do is seize opportunities and pick up the spoils of a disintegrating western-led international order. To taste a bit of that thinking, read Putin-propagandist Vladislav Surkov’s writings earlier this year about Russia’s role in the world as a model for nationalism and expansion based on brute force.No less daunting is the human toll – another shattering of the body of human rights conventions that Europe is meant to be one of the guardians of, but finds itself entirely powerless to salvage. Predictions are that Isis will try to regroup in the general mayhem. But already on display is how the Turkish, Syrian and Russian forces vying for control are leaving countless massacred civilians in their wake. We’ve by now had ample evidence of the extremes to which state-sponsored mass atrocities can lead in this near-decade of war in Syria. If anyone still held any doubts as to their deliberate nature, documented reports of Russia’s systematic bombing of hospitals will have perhaps dispelled them once and for all.This multilayered disaster in the Middle East will have dire consequences for European security (the terrorist threat), our domestic politics (the far right is entirely in tune with Assad and Putin, and is already gloating) and our societies at large. That’s because Assad’s Russia-backed victory in Syria will register as a decisive chapter in an era of fear, fragmentation and disinformation. That Brexit is playing out against this backdrop is almost a coincidental sideshow – however symbolic of the deeper trends at work. These days Europeans rightly scrutinise Spain and Catalonia, and ponder the outcome of elections in Poland and Hungary (has populism peaked, or is it still on the march?), but right now that feels narrow-minded, given the magnitude of what is unfolding not far from us.Historical analogies only go so far, but what’s different now is that we’re not just having to think about the domestic realities of demagoguery, xenophobia and homegrown illiberalism. We in Europe have to break out of our navel-gazing and see the bigger picture: what’s happening is no less than an ideological battle between democracy and authoritarianism in which our fate is intimately connected to those who find themselves in the crosshairs of Syria’s tragedy. In that sense, Syria is indeed the Spanish civil war of our times. Just as it was in the 1930s when totalitarianism was on the rise, it would be delusional to think that what we’ve done and haven’t done about it won’t come back to haunt us.• Natalie Nougayrède is a

"The US Congress will press ahead with a broad package of sanctions on Turkey, including cutting military support, after measures announced by the Trump administration were dismissed as ineffective, Senate officials have confirmed.The Republican senator Lindsey Graham and Democrat Chris van Hollen are expected to launch a bipartisan bill on Tuesday aimed at forcing the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to halt his military campaign in north-eastern Turkey, amid reports of widespread human rights abuses and the release of Isis militants who had been detained there.The Senate bill would impose restrictive measures on Turkey’s political leadership and Turkey’s domestic energy sector. It would also prohibit US military support to Turkey, a Nato ally.Donald Trump, widely blamed even by normally loyal supporters for giving a green light to the Turkish invasion, had sought to head off congressional sanctions and regain the initiative with an executive order on Monday.On Tuesday, the justice department announced new criminal charges against a major Turkish bank for what was described as a multi-billion dollar sanctions busting scheme. Halkbank was charged with fraud, money laundering, and sanctions offenses, for the scheme which involved selling Iranian oil for gold.“Halkbank’s systemic participation in the illicit movement of billions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil revenue was designed and executed by senior bank officials,” a justice department statement said. “The bank’s audacious conduct was supported and protected by high-ranking Turkish government officials, some of whom received millions of dollars in bribes to promote and protect the scheme.”It was unclear whether the unveiling of the charges was in any way coordinated with the sanctions and steep dip in US-Turkish relations. The US has already sentenced the bank’s general manager, and a gold trader, Reza Zarrab, who pleaded guilty and offered cooperation.Zarrab was a client of Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and it was revealed at the weekend that Trump had repeatedly tried to persuade the former secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, to have the case against him dropped.Trump’s executive order on Monday imposed a 50% tariff on imports of Turkish steel, called off what officials called a $100bn bilateral trade deal and gave the state department and Treasury wide powers to impose targeted sanctions on Turkish officials.However, both administration critics and sanctions analysts said the administration proposal looked more imposing than it was in reality. The White House has yet to rescind a White House invitation to Erdoğan which Trump offered to the Turkish president after being informed of the imminent offensive. And Trump’s sanctions package does not affect US military support to Turkey.Furthermore it was unclear whether a $100bn trade deal administration officials said had been shelved had ever existed in the first place.Daniel Tannebaum, a former sanctions official, now head of sanctions at Oliver Wyman management consultants, said: “There has not been any evidence of a deal matching what was described. So there were some shoulder shrugs when this was announced. People asked: ‘What are you referring to?’”Senator van Hollen called the Trump measures a “pathetic response”, pointing out that steel exports to the US were a fraction of one per cent of Turkey’s total exports. The Trump administration also has a record of slow-rolling sanctions against regimes where the president believes he has a strong personal relationship with the leader, such as Russia and Saudi Arabia.Turkish equity markets spiked when markets opened on Tuesday, in an apparent sign of relief at the limited nature of the US response to the Syria invasion.In Washington the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said: “President Trump has unleashed an escalation of chaos and insecurity in Syria. His announcement of a package of sanctions against Turkey falls very short of reversing that humanitarian disaster.”Peter Harrell, former deputy assistant secretary of state for counter threat finance and sanctions, said: “The executive order has the potential to really be quite broad and impose quite draconian sanctions, but the targets the administration has picked to date have been low to mid-range … So I think there’s sort of a substantive concern that the president doesn’t actually intend to be particularly aggressive here.”The most important difference between the congressional and administration sanctions packages could be the issue of military support. The Turkish army and air force is largely reliant on the US to keep up operations. Administration officials have been hesitant about imposing such military sanctions, for fear of pushing Turkey out of Nato altogether, though critics have argued that it has ceased to be an ally in any meaningful sense anyway.“If the Trump administration were truly serious about rolling back Turkey’s invasion of Syria, it would immediately cut off all US arms supplies to the Turkish military, including spare parts and maintenance,” William Hartung, director of the arms and security project at the Center for International Policy.“Turkey relies on the US for all of its combat aircraft and two-thirds of its armoured vehicles, so a full withdrawal of US support could degrade its fighting capability. And it would send a stronger message than the minimal economic measures the administration has taken thus far.”",Congress to launch sanctions on Turkey as Trump measures deemed

peter harrell former deputy assistant secretary of state for counter threat finance and sanctions said the executive order has the potential to really be quite broad and impose quite draconian sanctions but the targets the administration has picked to date have been low to mid range so i think there s sort of a substantive concern that the president doesn t actually intend to be particularly aggressive here the most important difference between the congressional and administration sanctions packages could be the issue of military support the turkish army and air force is largely reliant on the us to keep up operations administration officials have been hesitant about imposing such military sanctions for fear of pushing turkey out of nato altogether though critics have argued that it has ceased to be an ally in any meaningful sense anyway if the trump administration were truly serious about rolling back turkey s invasion of syria it would immediately cut off all us arms supplies to the turkish military including spare parts and maintenance william hartung director of the arms and security project at the center for international policy turkey relies on the us for all of its combat aircraft and two thirds of its armoured vehicles so a full withdrawal of us support could degrade its fighting capability and it would send a stronger message than the minimal economic measures the administration has taken thus far ,Iran Sanctions,0.287488669
"If Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s belligerent president, were a true patriot with his country’s security and wellbeing at heart, he would resign immediately. He has made an appalling hash of things. His Syrian misadventure, while unusually calamitous, is but the latest in a long line of foreign blunders. Erdoğan abuses his position. He harms his country. He is still in office not because he is popular but because of the fear he instils and the power he crudely wields. It’s time for him to go.Getting rid of Erdoğan is a matter for the Turks. And it wouldn’t be quite as difficult as it might soundHaving said that, doing the decent thing is not Erdoğan’s strong suit. His 16 years in power – as prime minister and then president – have been marked, at home, by growing authoritarianism and repression. The economy is an indebted mess. Corruption and nepotism thrive. After a 2016 military-led coup failed, Erdoğan exploited it to purge political opponents, the judiciary, civil society and the media. Tens of thousands of supposed plotters were jailed. Erdoğan’s creation of an executive presidency, concentrating power in his hands, was narrowly agreed in a 2017 referendum, and is proving a disaster for Turkish democracy. Effective checks and balances circumscribing his actions are lacking. Absent, too, are experienced figures, such as former prime minister Ahmet Davutoğlu and ex-deputy prime minister Ali Babacan, who might have reined him in. Alienated by his domineering behaviour, they have wisely jumped ship.Turkey’s ill-considered Syrian invasion is a byproduct of Erdoğan’s dictatorial behaviour. Like Donald Trump, he trusted his gut, not seasoned advisers. Now Syrians, mostly Kurds, are paying the price. All western leaders share some blame here. They have long known Erdoğan for what he is – yet for reasons of realpolitik, they looked the other way.These leaders must now be wishing Erdoğan gone. He has made Trump look like a gullible idiot – though, admittedly, that’s not hard. But his Syrian warmaking has also deeply alarmed regional states, uniting the Arabs, Israel and Iran in angry opposition while scaring the socks off the Saudi princes. They look askance at the Erdoğan-Trump betrayal of the Kurds and rightly worry whether US security guarantees, and Nato solidarity, are mere desert mirages.Nor does the EU, scarred over the years by Erdoğan’s tantrums over Turkey’s accession, have any love for him. Perhaps Brussels believes his threat to send 3.6 million Syrian refugees to Europe. What’s certain is that it justifiably fears his Syrian invasion will boost Islamic State terrorism. His early departure would be a boon for Europe.But getting rid of Erdoğan is a matter for the Turks. And it wouldn’t be quite as difficult as it might sound. True, Erdoğan has overseen an extraordinary attack on political and civil rights, including the right to free speech and a free press. His purges have swept up senior opposition politicians, notably Selahattin Demirtaş, leader of the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic party (HDP), who came third in last year’s presidential election despite being in jail. Judges, police chiefs, lawyers and civil servants who show signs of independent thinking have been sanctioned. The current crisis has brought further crackdowns on social media. And all the while, Erdoğan pursues an often lethal vendetta against Turkey’s Kurdish minority, linking them, for self-serving purposes, to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). Yet change is under way. Politically, Turkey is a divided country, split primarily between urban and rural – and since its founding in 2001, Erdoğan’s neo-Islamist Justice and Development party (AKP) has appealed to the latter constituency, to those attached to the traditional, devout way of doing things. Now, however, the mass movement of people into the cities is accelerating, the demographics are shifting, and so too are political allegiances. Istanbul, for example, has become a mega-city, home to more than 15 million people.In June, this national evolution translated into a landmark AKP defeat in Istanbul’s re-run mayoral election – a city Erdoğan himself once ruled. Turkey’s opposition, principally the Republican People’s party (CHP), now controls nine out of the 10 biggest urban areas, which account for about 70% of GDP.As Erdoğan’s excesses and failures mount, loyalty to him is weakening. High-profile AKP defectors include not only Babacan and Davutoğlu, who plan new political parties, but also Abdullah Gül, Turkey’s former president and a man regarded for many years as Erdoğan’s chief crony. A new Nation Alliance of the CHP and the Good (İyi) party was launched earlier this year. And there is talk of a broader, anti-AKP front encompassing the pro-Kurdish HDP – although analysts suggest it’s a long shot.Erdoğan’s grip on power remains firm, but not as firm as it once was. The furious international backlash to his Syrian disaster, publicly exposing his fallibility, will weaken it further. If new steel and other sanctions imposed by Trump intensify entrenched economic problems, causing more hardship, price rises and job losses, and if Turkish army troops begin dying in large numbers in a Syrian quagmire, this modern-day sultan could be in terminal trouble.Turkey, when all is said and done, is a democracy, not a one-man dictatorship – a fact Erdoğan has never fully grasped. Now, the charismatic aura that once surrounded him is dissolving. The spell that enthralled the country for so long is definitively broken. Erdoğan’s political obituaries are already being penned. He should jump before he is pushed.• Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",Erdoğan’s calamitous Syrian blunder has finally broken his spell over Turkey,2019-10-15/17:41:38,if recep tayyip

"The UK is suspending the granting of arms export licences to Turkey for weapons that might be used during military operations in Syria, the foreign secretary has said.Dominic Raab also condemned Turkey’s invasion of Syria, saying it risked worsening the humanitarian crisis and undermined the international effort to focus on defeating Islamic State terrorism. “This is not the action we expected from an ally. It is reckless. It is counterproductive and plays straight into the hands of Russia, and indeed the Assad regime,” he told MPs.Turkish troops entered north-east Syria last week in an offensive against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which Ankara has long maintained is an offshoot of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). The assault was triggered by Donald Trump’s announcement that US troops would withdraw from the Kurdish-held area.The UK has supplied £1.1bn of arms to Turkey since 2014 and it is not clear how UK trade officials will be able to determine if the arms could be used in Syria.Until Turkey launched its offensive there on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish. Since the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by Turkey and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.That leaves north-eastern Syria divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF – for now.On 17 October Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara’s operation for  five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdoğan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish “safe zone” in Syria.Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province. In late 2014, the Kurds were struggling to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside Turkey.Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF’s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump’s recent announcement that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.Erdoğan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this “safe zone”, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.Michael SafiRaab also said the UK would consider possible economic sanctions against Turkey, but said the balance of opinion within the EU at this stage was that it was doubtful whether they would achieve the goal of ending the Turkish offensive. He ruled out a no-fly zone in northern Syria as impractical.Trump’s announcement just over a week ago that he was withdrawing US troops has been widely viewed as a historic foreign policy blunder.Raab implicitly criticised Trump, saying the withdrawal had sent the wrong message to the US’s allies and destabilised broader efforts to fight Isis.A threat by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to flood Europe with refugees was totally unacceptable and “not the kind of language we expect from a Nato ally”, Raab added. Raab also said the UK was looking to give safe passage back to the UK for unaccompanied British children and orphans of Isis fighters, but conceded the British policy of seeking to prosecute foreign fighters in the region had been made more difficult by the arrival of Syrian regime forces.The government was criticised by Labour and Scottish National party MPs for initially resisting a push at the EU foreign affairs council on Monday to condemn the Turkish offensive. He countered that the British aim had been to produce a balanced EU statement that acknowledged Turkish security concerns about the presence of Kurds belonging to the PKK – which Turkey, the UK, the US and others consider a terrorist group – in Kurdish-administered north-east Syria.He also warned against “doing anything that might drive Turkey further into the arms of Russia and President Putin”.The British stance at the EU has been seen by some as a glimpse of a post-Brexit British foreign policy in which the search for markets, and trade deals, will need to be put ahead of solidarity with any European human rights foreign policy.The exchanges in parliament on Tuesday were remarkable for the degree of Conservative backbench criticism of Trump. Tom Tugenhadt, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, asked Raab if he could think of any decision by an ally that “has so exposed our troops in combat, weakened our alliances in the region, undermined our essential security partnership in Nato and empowered our enemies in Russia and Iran”.The former defence minister Tobias Ellwood said Trump’s action had triggered a tragic chain of events that could change the ethnic makeup of Syria and give Russia and Iran ever greater leverage. Direct conflict between Russia and Turkey was coming ever closer, he warned.The former cabinet minister David Davis described the episode as a geo-strategic disaster.Earlier Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, said Trump had made a profound strategic mistake by abandoning the Kurds.“We are probably looking at an end game where Assad has much more territory, Russia has another vassal state and the west’s role – particularly America’s – is dramatically reduced,” he said.Arms trade campaigners welcomed the British move, and said the UK had “clearly been shamed” into action after other European countries made a similar decision.Andrew Smith from the Campaign Against Arms Trade said any suspension could not only be limited to future arms sales and must also affect the hundreds of millions of pounds worth of arms that have been licensed over recent years. “This should also mark a turning point in UK foreign policy in Turkey,” Smith said. “In 2018 Turkish forces bombed Afrin and it made no difference to arms sales or military collaboration. If this move is to be more than symbolic then there can be no return to business as usual. It’s time that the rights of Kurdish people were finally put ahead of arms company profits.”",UK suspends arms exports to Turkey to prevent use in Syria,2019-10-15/14:38:03,the uk is suspending the

"Last week, Turkey began its long-planned attack on Kurdish forces in north-east Syria. Days before, the US president and his Turkish counterpart had spoken on the phone: Donald Trump was reportedly supposed to caution Recep Tayyip Erdoğan against a unilateral attack on Kurdish allies, who had helped to defeat Islamic State. Instead, he sanctioned one.The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) had previously agreed to all the terms of a US-sponsored “security mechanism” in the region. They made real concessions, removing fortifications and moving forces away from territory the Kurds had liberated from Isis on Turkey’s southern border. Erdoğan, however, has had no such commitment to diplomacy. The Turkish military used the agreement that had been in place for two months to gather intelligence on SDF positions, and on Tuesday it went ahead with its real goal: invasion.The US had multiple opportunities to defuse this crisis long before Trump’s fateful phone callThe beginning of the operation has been devastating. Airstrikes immediately targeted civilian towns along the 250-mile border between Turkey and the SDF-controlled region of Syria where Kurds, Arabs and Syriacs live together. Casualties and war crimes have been reported. Thousands of people have fled their homes, uncertain as to where they will go. Just hours after Turkish officials announced the operation would begin imminently, Isis cells in Raqqa also launched an attack on SDF personnel. The Kurds are now in the process of striking a deal with the Syrian government to stave off the assault and further humanitarian crises.With this attack, Erdoğan has opened a dangerous new chapter in a conflict that he has been escalating ever since peace talks with the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ party) broke down in 2015. The PKK was founded in 1978 by both Kurdish and Turkish students – when advocating for Kurdish rights in Turkey was punishable by torture and death. Since then, almost 50,000 people have been killed – mostly Kurdish and on the side of the PKK – after war broke out in 1984.There was hope the bloodshed would end in 2013, after the imprisoned leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan, halted the party’s commitment to armed struggle and called for the beginning of a peace process. But Erdoğan’s abrupt ending of the peace talks in 2015, in the face of bad pre-election polling numbers, proved he had no interest in peace, pluralism or democracy that could not be abandoned at the slightest sign of political inconvenience. The wave of repression of Kurds that has followed, conducted by Turkey in the name of “counter-terrorism”, in fact served only to incite more conflict.This dynamic is misunderstood internationally: whenever the Kurdish movement is discussed, it often comes with the caveat that the PKK is a “designated terrorist organisation”. While this is legally true, it misrepresents fundamental social and political realities. For tens of millions of Kurds across the region, the PKK is a defender of their existence. It will maintain this support until Kurds believe that the states in which they live – in Turkey, as well as Iraq, Syria and Iran – are not directly hostile to the Kurdish identity itself.The Turkish government, however, seeks to attack any and all forms of Kurdish political expression – and the civilians who support it. Even the Kurdistan regional government in Iraq, which has deep economic ties with Turkey, was threatened with “starvation” by Erdoğan when its people voted to express their desire for independence. Kurds across the Middle East – which number at least 30 million – have taken notice of this pattern. They will not underestimate how far the Turkish leader is prepared to go to damage their cause.Regardless, Erdoğan’s latest military offensive was not inevitable. The US had opportunities to defuse this crisis long before Trump’s fateful phone call: its alliance with Turkey and partnership with the Kurdish movement in Syria gave it the opportunity to encourage both sides to return to a political process. Instead, at each juncture, it chose to scramble for temporary military solutions, evading the political problem at the heart of the conflict. The US withdrawal was the culmination of its historical ignorance and strategic blindness. Trump’s framing of the removal of 50 American military personnel from the border – which preceded and enabled Turkey’s military action – as a reduction in US involvement in “endless wars”, and the abandonment of a key ally in the fight against Isis as a step towards more equitable burden-sharing in the region are both ludicrous justifications for what is clearly an unforced error.The effects of Trump’s decision, paradoxically, will only deepen the divisions driving the wars in both Turkey and Syria, and make the global fight against terrorism more difficult. The anti-Kurdish hostility behind last week’s invasion has also led Turkey to tolerate, and even support, Isis and al-Qaida in Syria, simply because those forces are also fighting the Kurds.Trump wants us to believe that Turkey can lead the anti-Isis campaign and take control of thousands of Isis prisoners. Meanwhile, Erdoğan’s army attacks the very Kurdish forces that previously defeated Isis. Such short-sightedness is how wars are more often started – not ended. And it is the Kurds of northern Syria who will once again pay the price.• Giran Ozcan is the Peoples’ Democratic party (HDP) representative to the USA and is based in Washington.

ties with turkey was threatened with starvation by erdoğan when its people voted to express their desire for independence kurds across the middle east which number at least  million have taken notice of this pattern they will not underestimate how far the turkish leader is prepared to go to damage their cause regardless erdoğan s latest military offensive was not inevitable the us had opportunities to defuse this crisis long before trump s fateful phone call its alliance with turkey and partnership with the kurdish movement in syria gave it the opportunity to encourage both sides to return to a political process instead at each juncture it chose to scramble for temporary military solutions evading the political problem at the heart of the conflict the us withdrawal was the culmination of its historical ignorance and strategic blindness trump s framing of the removal of  american military personnel from the border which preceded and enabled turkey s military action as a reduction in us involvement in endless wars and the abandonment of a key ally in the fight against isis as a step towards more equitable burden sharing in the region are both ludicrous justifications for what is clearly an unforced error the effects of trump s decision paradoxically will only deepen the divisions driving the wars in both turkey and syria and make the global fight against terrorism more difficult the anti kurdish hostility behind last week s invasion has also led turkey to tolerate and even support isis and al qaida in syria simply because those forces are also fighting the kurds trump wants us to believe that turkey can lead the anti isis campaign and take control of thousands of isis prisoners meanwhile erdoğan s army attacks the very kurdish forces that previously defeated isis such short sightedness is how wars are more often started not ended and it is the kurds of northern syria who will once again pay the price giran ozcan is the peoples democratic party

"The conflict engulfing north-east Syria is a wholly avoidable disaster. It was widely foreseen. It could, and should, have been prevented. Responsibility lies principally with Turkey’s bellicose president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. But many others share the blame, including a criminally incompetent Donald Trump, Islamic State jihadists, who previously destabilised the area, and the international community, which has failed, over the course of eight bloody years, to halt Syria’s civil war.The terrifyingly indiscriminate Turkish artillery barrages and air strikes directed at towns and villages in Kurdish-held areas along the border shame those who ordered them. Erdoğan’s claim that his forces are only targeting terrorists is given the lie by the rising toll of civilian deaths and injuries. Aid agencies have evacuated. Hospitals have closed. The UN says about 100,000 people have fled so far. With Turkey rejecting calls to halt the offensive, it could all get much worse.This is a calamity foretold. Turkey has longstanding, legitimate border security concerns. It believes the Kurdish militia that controls north-east Syria is in league with its old foe, the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which the US and the EU, like Ankara, regard as terrorists. Erdoğan had been threatening military action east of the Euphrates for months. Only the presence of US troops stopped him.US officials say an agreement with the Turks was in place, providing for joint border security patrols. But this was not enough for Erdoğan. His impatience arose not from the immediacy of the terrorist threat, which he often exaggerates, but stemmed, at least in part, from his need for a political “win” after recent election setbacks and from rising rightwing nationalist pressure to repatriate Syrian refugees to a Turkish-controlled “safe zone”.Who could blame Kurds, with their homes under attack, if they abandoned the detention camps to resist the invader?It is at this point that Erdoğan’s agenda converged with Trump’s visceral aversion to “endless” foreign wars and the impeachment furore in Washington. When Erdoğan phoned last Sunday evening, demanding that the US lift its veto on intervention, Trump saw a chance to both bring the troops home and distract attention from his Ukraine shenanigans.Official assertions that Trump did not give Erdoğan a green light are pure eyewash. The White House statement issued after the phone conversation makes clear this is exactly what happened. And yet, on one level, this outcome is unsurprising. Erdoğan and Trump are two of a kind: unscrupulous, instinctively authoritarian leaders ever ready to bend the truth. Neither can be trusted.These two men have something else in common. They do not understand, nor do they sufficiently care about, the consequences of their actions. Trump seems to have been genuinely taken aback by the storm of criticism, including from Republicans, which greeted his decision to pull back US troops. He was rightly lambasted for betraying America’s Kurdish allies and helping Russia, Iran and Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime. Fears were raised that Isis jihadists held under Kurdish guard might escape.The fate of detained Isis fighters, totalling about 10,000 across northern Syria and Iraq, is an issue to which Erdoğan, too, has plainly not given enough thought. He says Turkey will ensure they do not abscond. But his unimpressive ground forces, still thrashing about on the border, cannot be counted on to fulfil such pledges. Already there are reports of an Isis prison break in a town under Turkish bombardment and two Isis suicide bombings.Trump repeatedly, untruthfully, boasts that Isis was defeated on his watch. The “caliphate” is destroyed, but the jihadists still pose a threat, as a new International Crisis Group study shows. There are persistent reports that the organisation is regrouping. Trump and Erdoğan have potentially assisted this process. Who could blame Kurdish fighters, with their homes under attack, if they abandoned the detention camps and went to resist the invader?The international community is at fault, too, for failing to establish a process for bringing Isis terrorists to justice. Leaving them, their families and supporters stuck indefinitely in desert camps was never going to work. Western countries, including Britain, have mostly dodged their responsibilities in this regard, concerned that jihadists who hold British or European citizenship could be freed by domestic courts for lack of admissible evidence. To address this problem, they should consider the creation, under UN auspices, of an international criminal tribunal for counter-terrorism.Sadly, as the entire history of the Syrian war suggests, the chances of such international collaboration actually happening are all but non-existent. The UN security council, debating Turkey’s action, could not even agree a joint statement, due in part to the usual Russian obstructionism. The EU will discuss it at this week’s summit. Expect little more than stern words. Nato is just looking on. Meanwhile, Trump blusters about sanctions, as if it all had nothing to do with him.Pity the people of northern Syria, bombed and blasted from their homes by a ruthless autocrat who should, if there were any justice, face a war crimes tribunal.

"Two missiles hit an Iranian state-owned oil tanker as it headed to Syria on the Red Sea, the Iranian government has claimed.Tehran did not attribute responsibility immediately but said two explosions 20 minutes apart on the Sabiti tanker, which caused oil to spill from two tanks, were not the result of an accident.The boat was about 60 miles from the Saudi Arabian port city of Jeddah when it was hit. The scale of the damage did not appear extensive in photos published by Tehran news agencies.The blasts prompted speculation that they were a reprisal by Gulf states for attacks attributed to Iran on Saudi oil assets in September.Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced it was sending at least 1,000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia. It said the deployment meant that in the past month 3,000 troops had been sent to the kingdom or had their deployment extended.US Patriot missile defences failed to deter a cruise missile and drone attack that severely damaged two Aramco facilities and shocked the Saudi government last month. US officials have since discussed with their Middle Eastern ally how to strengthen Saudi defences, and the Pentagon said Friday’s deployment would “assure and enhance the defence of Saudi Arabia”.This week Donald Trump announced he was pulling troops from the Syrian border with Turkey and said he wanted to end America’s endless wars in the Middle East.It appears some of the newly announced troops are being despatched to replace other American forces expected to depart the region in the coming weeks.The US and the EU attributed the September attack to Iran, rejecting claims by Houthi rebels in Yemen that they were responsible. A full UN report on the incident has not yet been completedAn Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said: “Those behind the attack are responsible for the consequences of this dangerous adventure, including the dangerous environmental pollution caused. The details and factors behind this act will be investigated and will be announced after the results are reached.”Suggestions that the oil company that owned the tanker was blaming Saudi Arabia at this stage were denied.Friday’s incident, if confirmed as an attack, would be the first such incident targeting Iranian-owned shipping in the Gulf, though a state-owned tanker, Grace 1, was seized by British authorities off Gibraltar on the basis that it was breaching an EU oil embargo.Iranian news agencies stressed that the Sabiti was stable, no crew had been injured and the leak was being brought under control.Iranian ships routinely turn off their transponders to prevent tracking, but the Sabiti turned on its tracking devices late on Friday morning in the Red Sea, according to data from MarineTraffic.com.The vessel last turned on its tracking devices in August, showing it near the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas.Dryad Global, a firm specialising in oil shipping intelligence, said the vessel’s proximity to the port of Jeddah made it plausible that Saudi Arabia could have been involved, or at the very least that the incident was intended to create the perception of Saudi involvement.But it added: “In terms of Saudi interests within the region, it remains unclear why Saudi would seek to target Iran in this manner. An attack of relatively low sophistication with limited and almost negligible strategic gain would be highly irregular and not serve any Saudi strategic narrative. Further still, it is highly unlikely that the Saudis would risk an ecological disaster in an area of strategic significance such as the Red Sea.”Tension in the strait of Hormuz has been heightened for months as the US and Iran spar over Washington’s decision in 2018 to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal and impose worldwide sanctions on Iran including its oil exports.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst 'chokepoint'In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Phillip InmanAn attempt by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, at the UN general assembly in New York to engineer a meeting between the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, and Trump failed as the two sides could not reach agreement on the sequencing of the compromises the two sides would have to take. Since then, the Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, has stepped forward as a possible mediator between Iran and Saudi Arabia.The perception was that neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE, Iran’s two main Gulf rivals, were looking to escalate the crisis by undertaking a military response to the Aramco incident. It would be surprising if either Gulf state resorted to the kind of “plausible deniability” tactics allegedly deployed by Iran.Israel is also deeply hostile to Iran but has confined most of its attacks to Iranian military sites in Syria.The current round of attacks on oil shipping started on 12 May when four ships, including two Saudi oil tankers, were attacked in the Gulf just outside the strait of Hormuz, which is a major oil shipping route.US and British officials blamed Iran, a charge Tehran denies. A further two tankers were hit on 13 June, and a week later Iran said it had shot down a US surveillance drone, an attack that nearly led to a major reprisal by the Trump administration.Oil prices

"For Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, it’s a case of be careful what you wish for. By most accounts, Turkey’s president bamboozled Donald Trump into giving a green light for an invasion of north-east Syria.Yet now, having got what he wanted, Erdoğan faces some difficult choices. How far to go? Who is the enemy? And how long can such a big operation be sustained? It may be the biggest gamble yet by a politician known for taking risks.Worried about biting off more than they can chew, Turkey’s representatives are busily redefining and repurposing the military incursion, which began with a series of air strikes on Wednesday. What Erdoğan has for months described as an essential move to eliminate a Kurdish terrorist threat has suddenly been transformed into a “peace operation” primarily targeting Islamic State.İbrahim Kalın, Erdoğan’s right-hand man, referring to the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, told CNN: “This is not a move against the Kurds. Turkey doesn’t have any problem with the Kurds. We are fighting [a] terrorist organisation that has killed and oppressed the Kurdish people as well.” As for the main task of fighting Isis, the world should be grateful to Turkey, he suggested.It’s plain this abrupt change of tack was influenced by the uproar in Washington that followed Trump’s decision. Even normally sycophantic Republicans accused the White House of betraying Kurdish-led forces that hitherto spearheaded the anti-Isis fight. It’s possible Trump gave Erdoğan the go-ahead in order to distract attention from the impeachment inquiry. If so, his ruse backfired.Turkey has also changed its tune about long-term territorial ambitions in Syria, notwithstanding Erdoğan’s stated intention to create a quasi-permanent “safe zone” potentially 20 miles deep and 300 miles long (32km and 483km). “Turkey has no interest in occupying any part of Syria,” said Kalın, characterising previous cross-border operations in Jarablus and Afrin as mere temporary landgrabs.Fahrettin Altun, Erdoğan’s director of communications, meanwhile offered assurances that humanitarian considerations were uppermost. “The plan helps Turkey shelter innocent people,” he wrote in the Washington Post. Up to 2 million Syrian refugees now in Turkey would “volunteer” to live in the safe zone, he added – even though most do not have a prior connection with the area.Kalın also claimed a mass repatriation would take place voluntarily, not under duress, although nobody seems to have asked the people concerned and aid agencies are highly sceptical.As he prepares to send in the troops, Erdoğan face multiple unknowns. One is whether Turkey has the capacity, let alone the will, to lead the charge against Isis or take control of the detention and refugee camps presently guarded by the Kurds. Ankara is already being blamed in some quarters for jeopardising the fight against Isis.Like everybody else, Erdoğan has no idea which way Trump may jump next. Similar doubts apply to Russia, which is reportedly supportive but recently clashed with Turkey over operations in Idlib, and to Bashar al-Assad’s Iranian-backed regime in Damascus, which may use the confusion to recapture territory and insert its own forces.It’s unclear what the Turkish public, already disillusioned with Erdoğan and beset by deepening economic woes, will make of a costly, open-ended conflict that will look to many like an unnecessary war of choice. And if the dire humanitarian consequences predicted by the UN come to pass, Erdoğan surely knows he will bear the blame internationally – and face possible US and EU sanctions.For all these reasons, Erdoğan will probably tread cautiously at first. He may use Turkish-backed militia fighters from Syria’s rebel National Army, supported from the air, rather than regular Turkish troops in any initial deployment. Reports on Wednesday said the rebels were moving into position. US officials predict there will be no large-scale invasion and any first advance may be limited to establishing combat posts inside Syria.Only now fully aware, perhaps, of the dangers – personal, political and military – of his high-risk Syria gamble, Erdoğan can be expected to use a White House meeting with Trump on 13 November to try to shore up US support, possibly before making any definitive move. Yet what happens next may be beyond his control. Kurdish leaders insist there will be no retreat. If the Turks come, they say, they will take the fight to them.",Erdoğan's Syrian incursion could be his biggest gamble yet,2019-10-09/14:01:36,for recep tayyip erdoğan it s a case of be careful what you wish for by most accounts turkey s president bamboozled donald trump into giving a green light for an invasion of north east syria yet now having got what he wanted erdoğan faces some difficult choices how far to go who is the enemy and how long can such a big operation be sustained it may be the biggest gamble yet by a politician known for taking risks worried about biting off more than they can chew turkey s representatives are busily redefining and repurposing the military incursion which began with a series of air strikes on wednesday what erdoğan has for months described as an essential move to eliminate a kurdish terrorist threat has suddenly been transformed into a peace operation primarily targeting islamic state i brahim kalın erdoğan s right hand man referring to the syrian kurdish ypg militia told cnn this is not a move against the kurds turkey doesn t have any problem with the kurds we are fighting a terrorist organisation that has killed and oppressed the kurdish people as well as for the main task of fighting isis the world should be grateful to turkey he suggested it s plain this abrupt change of tack was influenced by the uproar in washington that followed trump s decision even normally sycophantic republicans accused the white house of betraying kurdish led forces that hitherto spearheaded the anti isis fight it s possible trump gave erdoğan the go ahead in order to distract attention from the impeachment inquiry if so his ruse backfired turkey has also changed its tune about long term territorial ambitions in syria notwithstanding erdoğan s stated intention to create a quasi permanent safe zone potentially  miles deep and  miles long km and km turkey has no interest in occupying any part of syria said kalın characterising previous cross border operations in jarablus and afrin as mere temporary landgrabs fahrettin altun erdoğan s director of communications meanwhile offered assurances that humanitarian considerations were uppermost the plan helps turkey shelter innocent people he wrote in the washington post up to  million syrian refugees now in turkey would volunteer to live in the safe zone he added even though most do not have a prior connection with the area kalın also claimed a mass repatriation would take place voluntarily not under duress although nobody seems to have asked the people concerned and aid agencies are highly sceptical as he prepares to send in the troops erdoğan face multiple unknowns one is whether turkey has the capacity let alone the will to lead the charge against isis or take control of the detention and refugee camps presently guarded by the kurds ankara is already being blamed in some quarters for jeopardising the fight against isis like everybody else erdoğan has no idea which way trump may jump next similar doubts apply to russia which is reportedly supportive but recently clashed with turkey over operations in idlib and to bashar al assad s iranian backed regime in damascus which may use the confusion to recapture territory and insert its own forces it s unclear what the turkish public already disillusioned with erdoğan and beset by deepening economic woes will make of a costly open ended conflict that will look to many like an unnecessary war of choice and if the dire humanitarian consequences predicted by the un come to pass erdoğan surely knows he will bear the blame internationally and face possible us and eu sanctions for all these reasons erdoğan will probably tread cautiously at first he may use turkish backed militia fighters from syria s rebel national army supported from the air rather than regular turkish troops in any initial deployment reports on wednesday said the rebels were moving into position us officials predict there will be no large scale invasion and any first advance may be limited to establishing combat posts inside syria only now fully aware perhaps of the dangers personal political and military of his high risk syria gamble erdoğan can be expected to use a white house meeting with trump on  november to try to shore up us support possibly before making any definitive move yet what happens next may be beyond his control kurdish leaders insist there will be no retreat if the turks come they say they will take the fight to them ,Iran Sanctions,0.373823524
"Donald Trump was dangerously isolated on Monday as, in a rare rebuke, some of his most loyal allies revolted against his decision to withdraw US troops from north-eastern Syria.Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell led a chorus of Republicans who, having defended the president on almost every other issue – including over impeachment – decided to draw a line in the sand.“A precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime,” McConnell said. “And it would increase the risk that Isis and other terrorist groups regroup.”He added: “As we learned the hard way during the Obama administration, American interests are best served by American leadership, not by retreat or withdrawal.”The criticism was significant because McConnell is usually at pains not to cross Trump even at his most capricious. Last week the Kentucky senator released a Facebook video promising to stop Democratic-led impeachment in its tracks.Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors"" – although the constitution does not specify what “high crimes and misdemeanors” are.The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives.The chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators.Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him.Martin BelamThe unusual fracture emerged on Sunday night when, shortly after a phone conversation between Trump and Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the White House announced removal of US troops from the Syria-Turkey border area. “Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria,” it added.Critics of all political stripes have long feared that the move could open the way for a Turkish strike on Kurdish-led fighters in the area. Kurdish groups have fought alongside a small US presence in Syria to drive Islamic State militants from the region.The Republican backlash was rapid and potentially unnerving for a president whose fate is tethered to the party and the assumption that it will acquit him in the Senate if, as widely expected, the Democratic-led House of Representatives votes for impeachment.Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, who has become an outspoken defender (and frequent golf partner) of Trump, did not acquiesce this time. Abandonment of the Kurds would be “a disaster in the making”, he said, and “a stain on America’s honour”.Graham told Fox News: “I hope I’m making myself clear how short-sighted and irresponsible this decision is. I like President Trump. I’ve tried to help him. This, to me, is just unnerving to its core.”Graham wrote on Twitter that if the plan goes ahead, he will introduce a Senate resolution opposing it and seeking reversal of the decision. He added: “We will introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria and will call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the US in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate.”Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, whose attempts to defend Trump’s phone call with Ukraine’s president have provoked mockery, said: “If you make a commitment and somebody is fighting with you, America should keep their word.”Michael McCaul of Texas, the lead Republican on the House foreign affairs committee, also urged the president to reconsider. “The United States should not step aside and allow a Turkish military operation in north-east Syria,” he said. “This move will undermine our ongoing campaign to prevent an Isis resurgence and will ultimately threaten our homeland.“Additionally, the United States needs to stay engaged to prevent further destructive involvement in the region from our adversaries like the Assad regime, Putin and Iran.”Notably, senator Marco Rubio of Florida, reluctant to criticise Trump even when the president suggested that China investigate former vice-president and 2020 election rival Joe Biden, was clear , describing the retreat as “a grave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria”.And Nikki Haley, Trump’s former UN ambassador, admonished Trump without mentioning his name. “We must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back,” she tweeted. “The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against Isis in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend”Ominously for Trump, even conservative Fox News aired dissent. Host Brian Kilmeade described the pullout as “a disaster”, telling viewers of Fox & Friends: “Abandon our allies? That’s a campaign promise? Abandon the people that got the caliphate destroyed?”Republicans who have contradicted Trump before did so forcefully again. Utah senator Mitt Romney described Trump’s announcement as “a betrayal”, adding: “It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster.”Romney and Democratic senator Chris Murphy issued a joint statement insisting Trump’s administration “explain to the American people how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests”.Democrats also piled in but there was a lone voice of support for the president on Capitol Hill. Republican senator Rand Paul, long a critic of foreign intervention, said: “So many neocons want us to stay in wars all over the Middle East forever. [Trump] is absolutely right to end those wars and bring the troops home.”Trump himself was undeterred by the blowback. Speaking at the White House on Monday, he said he has “great respect” for the prominent Republican critics. And added: “People are extremely thrilled because they say it’s time to bring our people back home. We’re not a police force. They’re policing the area. We’re not a police force. The UK was very thrilled at this decision … many people agree with it very strongly.”",Donald Trump isolated as Republican allies revolt over US withdrawal from Syria,2019-10-08/11:58:39,donald trump was dangerously isolated on monday as in a rare rebuke some of his most loyal allies revolted against his decision to withdraw us troops from north eastern syria senate majority leader mitch mcconnell led a chorus of republicans who having defended the president on almost every other issue including over impeachment decided to draw a line in the sand a precipitous withdrawal of us forces from syria would only benefit russia iran and the assad regime mcconnell said and it would increase the risk that isis and other terrorist groups regroup he added as we learned the hard way during the obama administration american interests are best served by american leadership not by retreat or withdrawal the criticism was significant because mcconnell is usually at pains not to cross trump even at his most capricious last week the kentucky senator released a facebook video promising to stop democratic led impeachment in its tracks article  of the united states constitution gives the house of representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president a president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors although the constitution does not specify what high crimes and misdemeanors are the process starts with the house of representatives passing articles of impeachment a simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage democrats currently control the house with  representatives the chief justice of the us supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the senate where the president is tried with senators acting as the jury for the president to be found guilty two thirds of senators must vote to

turkey s president recep tayyip erdoğan the white house announced removal of us troops from the syria turkey border area turkey will soon be moving forward with its long planned operation into northern syria it added critics of all political stripes have long feared that the move could open the way for a turkish strike on kurdish led fighters in the area kurdish groups have fought alongside a small us presence in syria to drive islamic state militants from the region the republican backlash was rapid and potentially unnerving for a president whose fate is tethered to the party and the assumption that it will acquit him in the senate if as widely expected the democratic led house of representatives votes for impeachment lindsey graham the chairman of the senate judiciary committee who has become an outspoken defender and frequent golf partner of trump did not acquiesce this time abandonment of the kurds would be a disaster in the making he said and a stain on america s honour graham told fox news i hope i m making myself clear how short sighted and irresponsible this decision is i like president trump i ve tried to help him this to me is just unnerving to its core graham wrote on twitter that if the plan goes ahead he will introduce a senate resolution opposing it and seeking reversal of the decision he added we will introduce bipartisan sanctions against turkey if they invade syria and will call for their suspension from nato if they attack kurdish forces who assisted the us in the destruction of the isis caliphate kevin mccarthy the top republican in the house

"Kurdish forces in Syria have said the fate of tens of thousands of suspected Islamic State fighters and their families is uncertain, after US forces began a sudden withdrawal from the Turkish-Syrian border, leaving their Kurdish allies to face the prospect of a Turkish invasion alone.The effects of the shock retreat reverberated through the region on Monday as Turkish forces massed near the border with the Kurdish stronghold of north-eastern Syria.The threat of a Turkish offensive marks the end of a US-Turkish arrangement established in August that saw troops from both countries carrying out joint patrols in a “safe zone” along the border keeping Turkish and Kurdish forces apart. That scheme was under strain, however, as Turkey wanted to establish military outposts deeper inside Syria and resettle non-Kurdish Syrian refugees in the designated safe zone. Those demands were opposed by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).In a phone conversation with Donald Trump on Sunday, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, appears to have told the US president he would no longer abide by the joint border arrangement and was preparing to invade.After the phone call, a White House statement (that showed signs of having been directly dictated by Trump) said: “Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria”, adding that US forces were being removed from the area of operations.The SDF said on Monday its US partners had already begun withdrawing troops from areas along Turkey’s border. Footage aired on the Kurdish news agency Hawar purportedly showed US armoured vehicles evacuating key positions in the border region.The SDF spokesman, Mustafa Bali, accused the US of leaving the area to “turn into a war zone”, adding that the SDF would “defend north-east Syria at all costs”.On Tuesday Syria’s deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad called on the country’s Kurds to rejoin the government side. “The homeland welcomes all its sons and Damascus will solve all Syrian problems in a positive way, away from violence,” Mekdad said in an interview with a pro-government paper.The Turkish defence ministry declared in a Twitter post late on Monday: “All preparations for a possible military operation into northeastern Syria are completed … Establishment of a safe zone is essential to contribute to stability and peace of the region and for Syrians to live in safety.”After a furious political backlash from US conservatives, in which Trump was accused of betraying the Kurdish fighters who look the lead in defeating Isis, the Trump administration insisted that the US had not endorsed a Turkish offensive.“It appears that the Turks are intent on some sort of military operation, possibly combined with an effort to resettle refugees,” a senior administration official said. “The president made it very clear publicly and privately that the US does not endorse or support any Turkish operation in northern Syria, or there’ll be no US armed forces involvement, or support for any operation that the Turks undertake.”In a sign of disapproval, the Pentagon ended a two-week-old confidence-building effort in which US and Turkish air forces collaborated in counter-terrorist operations, and the US also cut Turkey off the flow of intelligence from drone video feeds over Syria.“That doesn’t mean the Turks can’t fly over Syria. That just means they can’t fly with the US,” said Aaron Stein, the director of the Middle East programme and the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “The DoD [defence department] is trying to signal the consequences to Turkey, and they don’t want to look complicit in what is about to happen.”The administration official said that an estimated 50 to 100 US special forces soldiers were being pulled back from the 30km safe zone on the border, but would not be leaving Syria, but redeployed instead to more secure positions inside the country.“This does not constitute a withdrawal from Syria,” the official said. “We’re talking about a small number of troops that will move to other bases within Syria.”“The fact that we’re removing them is not a green light,” the official said. He added that Turkey would be held responsible if Isis detainees held by the SDF were able to escape as a result of the Turkish offensive, or if war crimes were committed. He pointed to a tweet on Monday by the president warning of repercussions.“As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I’ve done before!),” Trump’s tweet said.The confusion over US policy has followed a familiar pattern of the Trump presidency in which the president appears to dramatically alter course in an informal conversation with a foreign leader, follow up with a series of tweets, and leave the administration to try to rationalise, downplay or mitigate Trump’s impulses.As has often been the case, Washington’s European allies – UK, France and Germany – were not given advance notice of Trump’s Sunday night statement, though the administration official insisted that senior US administration officials had been informed.The background briefings provided by officials appeared to be at odds with what Trump himself has said. The White House statement issued on Sunday night gave no hint that the president disapproved of a Turkish offensive. Furthermore in his later tweets, Trump was adamant that the US troops withdrawn from the border would be brought back to the US, not redeployed inside Syria.In his tweets, Trump had appeared unsentimental about the Kurds, noting that they had been paid “massive amounts of money and equipment” in the four-year campaign, when they were used as the main US proxy to fight Isis in Syria.But the issue of Isis foreign fighters, most of them European, has clearly preoccupied the US president.Both Trump and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have repeatedly called on European states to repatriate around 20,000 foreign nationals currently held in north-east Syria for trial and rehabilitation at home.Trump argued it was up to Turkey and Europe and others, “to watch over the captured Isis fighters and families”.An SDF spokesman, Amjed Osman, said on Monday it was not clear what would happen to the prisoners. “We repeatedly called for foreign states to take responsibility for their Isis nationals. But there was no response,” he said in a statement. It is far from clear if Turkey has the capacity – or desire – to take custody of the detainees being held in crowded Kurdish jails and displacement camps, stretching the SDF to its limits and prompting warnings that militants are using the prisons to regroup.Some 74,000 women and children of the caliphate are held at the infamous Hawl camp, where they are guarded by just 400 SDF soldiers. But the camp, a hotbed of violence and extremist ideology, falls outside the parameters of the 32km-deep safe zone on the Turkish-Syrian border that Erdogan has said his forces would establish.The administration official briefing the press had claimed, wrongly, that the camps were inside the border zone.Aid agencies warned that an offensive could displace hundreds of thousands of people, and create a new humanitarian disaster.Save the Children said that more than 9,000 children from 40 countries were being held in camps and depended on humanitarian aid to survive.“Reports of imminent military operations and troops already sent to the border are deeply troubling. The international community, including the UK, should take urgent steps to do what’s best for these children and bring them to their home countries before access becomes even more unpredictable,” the group said.The Guardian understands that the SAS and French special forces present in Rojava would be tasked with securing the camp perimeters if the Kurds withdrew. However, with only several hundred troops between them, their numbers would need to be quickly boosted by regular soldiers to avoid a catastrophic collapse in security.In Washington, the move was condemned by allies and opponents of the president. House speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said the move “poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner”.The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said: “A precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that Isis and other terrorist groups regroup.”The Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump loyalist on most issues, said he would call for Turkey’s suspension from Nato and introduce sanctions against Ankara if the Turks attack Kurdish forces.“This decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran, & Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids. Shot in the arm to the bad guys. Devastating for the good guys,” Graham wrote in a tweet.During the campaign against Isis, the SDF did the bulk of the ground fighting to defeat Isis in Syria, losing 11,000 troops in the grinding battle. The senior ranks of the organisation are dominated by members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has fought a four-decade guerrilla war against the Turkish government.Ankara has long complained that, while fighting Isis, PKK forces were also waging war in Turkey.

"Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, has ruled out negotiations on its nuclear programme with the United States so long as sanctions remained in place and said he was not interested in a “memento photo” with Donald Trump.“I would like to announce that our response to any negotiation under sanctions is negative,” Rouhani said in an address to the UN general assembly in New York.His remarks represent the final nail in the coffin of efforts to negotiate a high-profile summit between Rouhani and the US president at the UN.European states will now face fresh pressure from the US to pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which is unravelling under pressure from the Trump administration. Iran has turned back to expanding its nuclear enrichment programme after Trump’s decision last year to pull out of the accord and re-impose sanctions on Tehran, targeting its ability to export oil.In an eagerly awaited address, Rouhani said: “For one and a half years, the US government has sought to deprive Iran of its right to access the world economy by threats and extra-territorial sanctions … Halt the sanctions and return to your commitments so the dialogue may reopen.”Iran has “resisted the most merciless economic terrorism” from a nation that is engaging in “international piracy”, Rouhani said. “Memento photos are the final stage of negotiations, not the first one.”He challenged the sincerity of America’s offer of negotiations, pointing to Trump administration officials’ boasts of the damage inflicted by sanctions on Iran. “We cannot believe the invitation to negotiations by people who claim to have applied the harshest sanctions in history against the dignity and prosperity of our nation,” he said.His remarks left the US and Iran as far apart as ever despite parallel mediation efforts from France, the UK, Pakistan and Japan.The impasse leaves the west and its Gulf allies faced with a dilemma over how to respond to the attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia earlier this month. The EU has attributed responsibility to Iran, but a detailed report has not yet been compiled. Iran for its part is likely to take further steps away from the nuclear deal, and may escalate attacks on Gulf shipping.Iran has denied any involvement and says any strikes by the US or Saudi Arabia will lead to “all-out war”. Emphasising the precarious regional situation, Rouhani said on Wednesday: “Our region is on the edge of collapse, as a single blunder can fuel a big fire.”Some key Gulf states such as the United Arab Emirates are wary of military action. UAE officials said privately that diplomacy is the focus.The Gulf states believe the Saudi attack has shaken EU support for the existing nuclear deal, and scope now exists to bring the US and Europe together in pursuit of a reworked wider deal that covers Iran’s ballistic missile program and constraints on Iran’s regional behaviour.Germany, France and the UK remain committed to the nuclear deal but it was becoming “increasingly difficult”, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, said earlier on Wednesday.Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson expended intense energy on the sidelines of the UN general assembly trying to persuade Iran to make a move that would allow Trump to drop sanctions.Iran claimed it was offering to break the deadlock by moving more quickly to to an era of permanent more intrusive inspections of its potential nuclear sites. But it said it would act only so long as the US agreed to lift its sanctions and the US Congress turned the deal into a permanent treaty.The proposal, as briefed, did not extend beyond what was proposed previously by the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, in July and rejected by the US as insufficient.But Rouhani offered a glimmer of hope in his speech, saying: “Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations...The JCPOA was a minimum for you and for us, however if you wish more, or require more, you should also give and pay more.”The US emphasised the negative diplomatic trend by announcing further sanctions against Iran, including by targeting Chinese entities that purchasing oil from Tehran. Speaking to an Iranian dissident group in New York, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said: “We’re telling China, and all nations – know that we will sanction every violation of sanctions of all activity.”He said that sanctions were being placed both on companies and on their chief executives.On the first two days of the general assembly, Macron had sought to persuade the US and Iran to move simultaneously so the Iranians give wider explicit assurance to adjust the nuclear deal, including coming back into compliance with its existing terms, at the same time as Trump lifted sanctions. In broadcast interviews at the UN Rouhani had admitted that the lack of trust between the US and Iran was making it difficult for either side to move.At a late-night meeting on Tuesday Johnson urged Rouhani metaphorically to stand by the swimming pool with Trump and to jump together.The foreign secretary, Douglas Raab, told MPs that the UK was not abandoning support for the current nuclear deal, but said “we can improve on it”.“Ultimately, we need a longer-term framework that provides greater certainty over Iran’s nuclear programme. And, as the attack on Aramco demonstrates, we must also bring into scope Iran’s wider destabilising activities.”",Iran’s president rejects nuclear talks before sanctions are

"Saudi Arabia has said that US patience with Iran is not inexhaustible and warned that military options are still being considered following the attack on the Aramco oil facilities earlier this month.The Saudi foreign affairs minister, Adel al-Jubeir, also said the UN-commissioned report into the origins of the attack will be available fairly soon, and described the EU’s Monday statement ascribing responsibility to Iran as “very significant”.His remarks suggest Saudi Arabia is still putting private pressure on Donald Trump’s administration not to limit his response to the 14 September attack to further sanctions and the deployment of additional troops to defend the oil facilities.Jubeir said: “We want to mobilise international support, and we want to look at a whole list of options – diplomatic options, economic options and military options – and then make the decision.”Speaking on the margins of the UN general assembly in New York, he said: “This action will have consequences and Iran must know this.”He added: “When push comes to shove, there comes a point when even America’s patience runs out – and Iran must be aware of that.”The attacks temporarily knocked out more than 5% of global oil production and caused petroleum prices to rise.Also at the UN, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Tuesday he was hoping for a breakthrough with Iran over the possibility of reopening talks in the coming hours.But the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, denied he was willing to drop his demand that US sanctions are lifted before talks can begin.Macron told the general assembly: “I am not naive at all and I don’t believe in miracles. I believe it takes courage to build peace and that is why it is important for the United States, Iran and the signatories of the agreement to show this courage.”But Jubeir set out a series of tough conditions for renegotiating the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, including fresh restrictions on its nuclear programme after 2025, a 24/7 inspection regime all over the country and restrictions on its ballistic missile programme.The demand, he said was “no nukes, no missiles and no terrorism”, adding: “The Europeans were coming round to this being the objective. We believe appeasement does not work with Iran.“We believe that when Europeans did not take a strong position after the attacks on the pipelines and oilfield in Shaybah [in August], this emboldened and encouraged Iran.”Although Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attacks on the Abqaiq and Khurais facilities, Riyadh, Washington and the EU have laid the blame on Iran.The US said it had expected Monday’s statement by the UK, France and Germany, stating that Iran was behind the attack, because European and US investigators are examining weapons fragments together in Saudi Arabia.“I really appreciate that our allies … have come forward and recognised publicly the truth,” the US assistant secretary of state for the near east, David Schenker, told journalists.“This did not come as a major surprise. The Brits and the French are on the ground with us, with the Saudis and the UN part of the investigative team in Saudi Arabia,” Schenker said.“We have been transparent in terms of chain of custody … of all the equipment that we now have from the attack.

"The former UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has said Britain would obey a court order to repay £400m to Iran, if the precise sum owed is agreed, but added the cash could not be linked to the release of the imprisoned British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.He also said western policy towards Iran was not working, arguing Europe and the US needed to come together with a new policy that provided a ladder for Iran to climb down leading to sanctions relief.Hunt was speaking on the day the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, was scheduled to meet the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, in New York on the sidelines of the UN general assembly to discuss the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe.Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, is in New York to launch a campaign, supported by Hunt, that brings together families from different nationalities that have fallen victim to state hostage taking.Hunt said Ratcliffe was right and that “quiet behind the scenes diplomacy by individual countries is clearly not working”.He accused the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, of explicitly linking the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe to the UK payment of a historical debt owed by the UK. The debt relates to a deal in the 1980s over the UK’s non-delivery of Chieftain tanks for which a previous Iranian regime had paid.Successive courts have found the UK is liable to pay the debt, but Hunt told BBC Radio 4 there was an outstanding legal dispute over the precise sum. There has also been a hidden political dispute within the UK government over whether the money should be paid.Zarif on Sunday claimed an agreement had been reached with some cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond for the release of the money, but Hunt as foreign secretary had scuppered the deal.Hunt hit back by saying it was extraordinary that Zarif was admitting “very openly they are holding an innocent woman with a five-year-old daughter as a tool of diplomatic leverage to try to settle a financial dispute with the UK”.He added: “Our policy as the British government had always been absolutely clear. We are a law-abiding government, so if there is a court order that says that this money has to be paid ... then we obey the law”. He said “the court process is still continuing, it is still deciding the exact amount that has to be paid.“We obey court rulings, but what we will not do is link it to the release of a hostage because if you do that you then you encourage countries like Iran to take hostages in the future when they have another dispute.”He denied he had taken a different view to previous foreign secretaries. Ministerial sources say the biggest blockage came from Gavin Williamson during his time as defence secretary, and that the issue is politically off the table due to the UK declaring, along with France and Germany this week, that Iran was responsible for the attack on the Saudi Aramco oil installations on 14 September.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is arrested at Imam Khomeini airport as she is trying to return to Britain after a holiday visiting family with her daughter, Gabriella.Her husband, Richard Radcliffe, delivers a letter to David Cameron in 10 Downing Street, demanding the government do more for her release.She is sentenced to five years in jail.

Four days after his comments, Zaghari-Ratcliffe is returned to court, where his statement is cited in evidence against her.

You cannot underestimate the significance of that.“By the same merit, the European policy of trying to keep the nuclear deal going is also failing because Iran is in the process of breaching its uranium limits, so we need to rethink. The lesson I think is that when the US and Europe go their separate ways on Iran policy, in the end it does not work and we need to come together.”He said the Iranians needed to clearly know the negative consequences if they behaved negatively, and “at the same time there has to be a ladder for them to climb down so that if they start to behave positively, so they can see a more positive outcome in terms of sanctions relief or whatever it is”.In a joint statement issued on Monday evening, the UK, France and Germany defended the existing Iran deal but re-emphasised a position first adopted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in the months leading up to Donald Trump quitting the deal in 2018.Macron had proposed the agreement signed in 2015 could be expanded to include new proposals for how the nuclear deal would function after some of its terms expire in 2025.

"The British-flagged tanker seized by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards more than two months ago has been released, according to Iranian officials.“The legal process has finished and based on that the conditions for letting the oil tanker go free have been fulfilled and the oil tanker can move,” Ali Rabiei, Iran’s government spokesman, said on Monday, according to the official IRNA news agency.The Stena Impero’s Swedish owners are yet to confirm the vessel has been freed from the port city of Bandar Abbas, but had said on Sunday its release was imminent.The decision to release the vessel comes a day before a meeting between Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York.Analysts said the timing of the announcement could be aimed at generating some goodwill ahead of the international meeting in which the Islamic Republic is expected to face pressure over allegations it carried out or supported last week’s missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure.Johnson was asked at the UN meeting on Monday about the attacks. “How do we respond to what the Iranians plainly did? What the UK is doing is trying to bring people together and de-escalate tensions,” he told Sky.The Stena Impero was dramatically seized on 19 July as it passed through the strait of Hormuz after Iranian officials claimed it had infringed maritime regulations. Footage released by Iran showed Revolutionary Guards descending from a helicopter to take control of the ship and detain its 23 crew members.About two weeks earlier, British Royal Marines seized an Iranian supertanker off the coast of Gibraltar carrying 2.1m barrels of crude oil that UK authorities alleged was to be sold to Syria in breach of EU sanctions against Bashar al-Assad’s government. Iran has denied the Stena Impero’s impoundment was a tit-for-tat move.The takeover, which led the UK to advise its ships to temporarily avoid the strait of Hormuz, was part of a wave of sabotage attacks and seizures of ships over the past six months in and around the narrow waterway through which more than a quarter of the world’s oil supply passes.The US and Gulf states have blamed Iran for the incidents, including the alleged use of explosives against four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May, suspicious fires on two tankers in the same area in June and the attempted seizure of a British vessel in July, allegedly by Iranian boats that were driven off by a Royal Navy warship.A Gibraltar court ordered the release of the Iranian vessel, then called Grace and since renamed Adrian Darya 1, on 18 August after receiving written assurances from Iran that it would not head to countries under EU sanctions.The Adrian Darya switched off its transported near the Syrian coast earlier this month. Satellite imagery of the ship analysed by the independent service TankerTrackers showed the vessel near the Syrian port of Tartus on Sunday, casting a thin shadow that suggested it could still be laden with oil.As we were asked last night whether or not the #AdrianDarya1 is still full of oil or not, here is yesterday's @planetlabs RapidEye (5m/pixel) constellation imagery which we have converted to b&w without enhancement.

Iran had been in full compliance with the agreement when it was breached by the US.In his Sky interview in New York on Monday, Johnson echoed Washington’s position in calling for Tehran to return to the negotiating table. “Whatever your objections to the old nuclear deal with Iran, it’s time now to move forward and do a new deal,” he said. The incidents in the strait of Hormuz have led the US to create the international maritime security construct, an alliance of countries including Bahrain, Australia and the UK, whose vessels are

"The UK now believes Iran was responsible for a major attack earlier this month on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, Boris Johnson has said, also raising the possibility that the British military could become involved in helping secure the Saudis against future aggression.Speaking to reporters on his plane en route to the UN general assembly (UNGA) in New York, the prime minister said there was “a very high degree of probability” that Iran was behind the drone and missile attack two major oil installation on 14 September.Stressing his desire to avoid any escalation in the rumbling crisis, Johnson said he saw the UK’s role as “serving as a bridge between our European friends and the Americans” on the issue.The US and Saudi Arabia have previously said they believe the attack was carried out by Iran, and not by Houthi rebels battling Saudi forces in Yemen, who Iran says were to blame.Johnson was due to hold joint talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, while in New York, in the guise of the so-called E3 group, which formulates policy on Iran between the nations. Neither France nor Germany has so far said who it believed was responsible.The prime minister was also due to hold bilateral talks with Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, on Tuesday, where he will discuss the Saudi attack and the continued detention of UK-Iran dual nationals including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.Speaking on the plane Johnson said one of his key objectives at UNGA was to help “bring the world together in response to what happened in Saudi Arabia, in our management of Iran”.He said: “I can tell you that the UK is attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to Iran for the Aramco attacks. We think it very likely indeed that Iran was indeed responsible, using both drones and cruise missiles.“Clearly, the difficulty is how do we organise a global response, what is the way forward. We’ll be working with our American friends and our European friends to construct a response that tries to de-escalate tensions in the Gulf region.”Johnson went on: “On what kind of action we can take, you’ll have seen that the Americans are proposing to do more to help to defend Saudi Arabia, and we will be following that closely.“And clearly, if we are asked, either by the Saudis or by the Americans, to have a role then we will consider what way we could be useful.”Questioned whether this meant a response could involve UK military forces, he said: “We will consider in what way we can be useful, if asked, depending on what the exact plan is.”But he declined to specify any possible action, saying on the idea of tighter sanctions: “There is certainly a case for responding together, and that’s what we’re going to do.”Separately, a British government official told reporters that the Houthi’s claim to have carried out the attack was “implausible”.He said: “Imagery from the site of the attack shows remnants of Iranian-made ground-attack cruise missiles. The scale, sophistication and range of the attack is inconsistent with the Houthi’s capability.”",Saudi Arabia oil attack: Boris Johnson says UK believes Iran responsible,2019-09-23/06:00:19,the uk now believes iran was responsible for a major attack earlier this month on saudi arabian oil facilities boris johnson has said also raising the possibility that the british military could become involved in helping secure the saudis against future aggression speaking to reporters on his plane en route to the un general assembly unga in new york the prime minister said there was a very high degree of probability that iran was behind the drone and missile attack two major oil installation on  september stressing his desire to avoid any escalation in the rumbling crisis johnson said he saw the uk s role as serving as a bridge between our european friends and the americans on the issue the us and saudi arabia have previously said they believe the attack was carried out by iran and not by houthi rebels battling saudi forces in yemen who iran says were to blame johnson was due to hold joint talks with the french president emmanuel macron and the german chancellor angela merkel while in new york in the guise of the so called e group which formulates policy on iran between the nations neither france nor germany has so far said who it believed was responsible the prime minister was also due to hold bilateral talks with iran s president hassan rouhani on tuesday where he will discuss the saudi attack and the continued detention of uk iran dual nationals including nazanin zaghari ratcliffe speaking on the plane johnson said one of his key objectives at unga was to help bring the world together in response to what happened in saudi arabia in our management of iran he said i can tell you that the uk is attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to iran for the aramco attacks we think it very likely indeed that iran was indeed responsible using both drones and cruise missiles clearly the difficulty is how do we organise a global response what is the way forward we ll be working with our american friends and our european friends to construct a response that tries to de escalate tensions in the gulf region johnson went on on what kind of action we can take you ll have seen that the americans are proposing to do more to help to defend saudi arabia and we will be following that closely and clearly if we are asked either by the saudis or by the americans to have a role then we will consider what way we could be useful questioned whether this meant a response could involve uk military forces he said we will consider in what way we can be useful if asked depending on what the exact plan is but he declined to specify any possible action saying on the idea of tighter sanctions there is certainly a case for responding together and that s what we re going to do separately a british government official told reporters that the houthi s claim to have carried out the attack was implausible he said imagery from the site of the attack shows remnants of iranian made ground attack cruise missiles the scale sophistication and range of the attack is inconsistent with the houthi s capability ,Iran Sanctions,0.276730418
"Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, has said he will present a plan for Gulf security at this week’s UN general assembly, as Washington and Tehran fight for diplomatic advantage in the wake of the devastating attack on the Saudi oil industry.Rouhani made clear the Iranian proposal, dubbed the ‘Coalition of Hope’, was designed to exclude the US, which would make it unpalatable to Gulf states who see Washington as an ally and protector.Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, later said that opposition to foreign forces in the Gulf was not a precondition for joining the coalition, and that all the permanent members of the UN security council were welcome to take part.Iran’s scheme is seen at the UN an attempt for the diplomatic high ground, at a time when the US and Saudi Arabia blame the country for the 14 September air strikes on Saudi oil fields, and the Gulf appears on the brink of a major conflict.“The security of the Persian Gulf, the strait of Hormuz, and the Sea of Oman is indigenous,” President Rouhani said at an extensive military parade marking the 39th anniversary of the Iran-Iraq war. “Foreign forces could cause problems and insecurity for our nation and region,” he added.In a move likely aimed at easing pressure on Iran ahead of Rouhani’s general assembly speech on Wednesday, a maritime official was quoted in the Iranian press as saying that a British-flagged oil tanker, the Stena Impero, seized by Iran more than two months ago, would soon be allowed to set sail from the port of Bandar Abbas.Asked about Rouhani’s plan on Sunday, Trump said he was open to hearing it. “I’m always open,” he said. “We’re doing our own thing with Iran,” the president added, and claimed “tremendous progress” has been made. He has sought to play down the attacks on Saudi oil installations, claiming that the US is no longer dependent on oil from the Gulf.World leaders converge on New York for the annual general assembly summit this week at a time of deep discord. While most heads of state and government will take part in a summit on the climate emergency on Monday, Trump will deliver a speech on religious freedom at the same time in the UN complex, attacking US adversaries for their records on the issue.There will be rival delegations from Venezuela, each backed by different permanent members of the UN security council, which is also split over the conflicts in Syria and Yemen.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Houthi officials had warned diplomats that Iran was putting them under pressure to take part in a second wave of attacks.At the same time, the Houthis have offered a ceasefire to Saudi-backed Yemeni government. The offer was welcomed by the UN special envoy on Yemen, Martin Griffiths, who said that its implementation “in good faith could send a powerful message of the will to end the war”.Saudi Arabia, which leads a coalition of Gulf monarchies fighting in Yemen, gave a cautious response. Its foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir said: “We judge other parties by their deeds, actions and not by their words, so we will see [whether] they actually do this or not.”On the air attacks on a Saudi oil field and refinery, Jubeir said: “It was done with Iranian weapons, therefore we hold Iran accountable for this attack.”He added that Riyadh would not give its full response until after the UN investigation was completed.“The kingdom will take the appropriate measures based on the results of the investigation, to ensure its security and stability.” Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said Iran would not necessarily accept the results of a UN investigation, calling into question its impartiality.Reformist-backed cleric Hassan Rouhani wins presidential election, defeating conservative Tehran mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.Iran signs the joint comprehensive plan of action with the US, UK, China, Russia, France, Germany and the EU after years of negotiations.

France, Germany have declined to contribute. The only other countries to join are the UK and Bahrain.“I cannot say a priori that the people who are being sent will conduct an impartial investigation because we’ve had cases in the past where they didn’t,” Zarif told a CBS News programme, Face the Nation. In comments to journalists in New York on Sunday, Zarif said that Trump’s designation of Iran’s central bank on Friday as being linked to terrorism had cut off any remaining hope of resuming US-Iran negotiations. He said the decision removed a loophole by which the central bank could finance food and medicine purchases, and because it made it very difficult for Trump or any future president to reverse.“President Trump knowingly or unknowingly on Friday closed the door to negotiations, Zarif said. “Because if he cannot remove the central bank from that designation, then there wont be any normalisation of economic activity. So he doesn’t have anything to offer to us to sit at the negotiating table.”The US has made clear its own initial response will be diplomatic, but it has moved more military hardware to the region. A destroyer, the USS Nitze, has reportedly arrived at the northern end of the Gulf, as part of a range of deployments aimed at shoring up Saudi defences.On Sunday the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, repeated the administration’s intention to lead with diplomacy. “Apparently the Iranians are bloodthirsty and looking for war. president Trump and I, we’re looking for a diplomatic resolution

"Iran says it will soon release a British-flagged tanker that its Revolutionary Guards seized more than two months ago, sparking a crisis in Gulf shipping.Maritime authorities in the Islamic republic told the semi-official Fars news agency on Sunday that the Swedish-owned Stena Impero would imminently be released, confirming earlier remarks by the chief executive of Stena Bulk, the company that owns the vessel.“We received information this morning indicating that the ship Stena Impero is going to be released in a few hours,” Erik Hanell, chief executive at Stena Bulk, told Swedish television SVT on Sunday.The Stena Impero was dramatically seized on 19 July as it passed through the strait of Hormuz after Iranian officials claimed it had infringed maritime regulations. Footage released by Iran showed Revolutionary Guards descending from a helicopter to take control of the ship and detain its 23 crew members.About two weeks earlier, British Royal Marines seized an Iranian supertanker off the coast of Gibraltar carrying 2.1m barrels of crude oil that UK authorities alleged was to be sold to Syria in breach of EU sanctions against Bashar al-Assad’s government. Iran has denied the Stena Impero’s impoundment was a tit-for-tat move.The takeover, which led the UK to advise its ships to temporarily avoid the strait of Hormuz, was part of a wave of sabotage attacks and seizures of ships over the past six months in and around the narrow waterway through which more than a quarter of the world’s oil supply passes.The US and Gulf states have blamed Iran for the incidents including the alleged use of explosives against four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May, suspicious fires on two tankers in the same area in June and the attempted seizure of the British vessel in July, allegedly by Iranian boats that were driven off by a Royal Navy warship.A Gibraltar court ordered the release of the Iranian vessel, then called Grace and since renamed Adrian Darya 1, on 18 August after receiving written assurances from Iran that it would not head to countries under EU sanctions.Tehran denies making any such assurances and the UK says the Adrian Darya 1, which turned off its transponder off the Syrian coast earlier this month, has sold its oil to Assad’s regime. Satellite images of the ship said to have been taken days after it stopped transmitting its location showed it near the Syrian port of Tartus.Iran’s envoy to London claims the cargo was sold to a private company in a ship-to-ship transfer. The Islamic republic’s oil exports have fallen from around 2m barrels per day in August 2018 to around 160,000 barrels per day after the US imposed sanctions on the industry in November.Reformist-backed cleric Hassan Rouhani wins presidential election, defeating conservative Tehran mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.Iran signs the joint comprehensive plan of action with the US, UK, China, Russia, France, Germany and the EU after years of negotiations.

"They must be laughing their socks off in Tehran. The days following last weekend’s attacks on Saudi oil facilities, blamed by the US on Iran, have seen an almost comical display of indecision, confusion and bluster by the leader of the world’s most powerful country. As a result, Iran looks stronger … and Donald Trump looks like a clown.If Iranian leaders intended to call Trump’s bluff, they have succeeded – for now at least. The president’s immediate reaction to the attacks was to declare the US “locked and loaded” for retaliatory strikes. Then he remembered he’s opposed to fighting wars in the Middle East and hopes to be re-elected next year.Trump switched tack, saying the attacks were no big deal, even as global oil prices rocketed, because the US no longer needed Middle East energy. That’s not strictly true. Official figures show the US imported 48 million barrels of oil and petroleum products a month from the Gulf in 2018. Still dodging and weaving, he said what happened next was up to the Saudis – an extraordinary outsourcing of national security policy.Trump ended the week still trying to have it both ways. He imposed additional sanctions on Iran and ordered a limited number of troops to Saudi Arabia and the UAE for defensive purposes. But he did not rule out talks with Iran’s president at the UN this week – despite the US denial of visas to many of his officials. It had become painfully clear Trump simply had no idea what to do. With his “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran backfiring and his bellicose threats ringing hollow, he is the emperor with no clothes, the president who speaks loudly and fears to wield the big stick. Trump, plainly, has no strategy, no back-up plan – and no clue.This White House farce, which included the appointment of uber-hawk Robert O’Brien to replace uber-hawk John Bolton as national security adviser, is of course no laughing matter. Trump could start firing off missiles at any moment. His unpredictability is part of the problem. The Iranians, emboldened, could overplay their hand. Another perceived provocation could jerk the meter back towards war. Yet this latest phase of the Iran crisis does have an upside. By supplying a much-needed reality check, it has driven home to all concerned the disastrous consequences a new, multi-dimensional Gulf war could have for international security and the global economy. And it has exposed Trump’s failure to think through his bid to force Iran to its political and economic knees.Another hard truth is that Iran is proving a tougher nut to crack than hawks such as Bolton ever imaginedOne such newly illuminated hard truth is the very limited nature of US military options. Military analysts say missile strikes, or a naval blockade of Iranian ports, would invite devastating retaliation. After the Iraq experience, ground troops are out of the question. And attacks on Iranian allies such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah would risk drawing Israel into an expanding regional conflict. Although it has drawn up a target list, the Pentagon cautioned Trump last week against taking precipitate action. Another hard truth is that Iran is proving a tougher nut to crack than hawks such as Bolton ever imagined. The oilfield attacks, using drones and cruise missiles, demonstrated considerable military daring and technical expertise. Embarrassingly, they bamboozled the Saudis’ expensive US-supplied Patriot missile defences and early-warning systems. Abandoning its policy of “strategic patience” after enduring a year of punitive oil and financial sanctions, Iran has shifted to a twin-track strategy, slowly resuming prohibited nuclear activities while disrupting global energy supplies, for example by targeting Gulf tankers. So far, despite all Trump’s ranting, Tehran has paid zero military price. Meanwhile, it has flatly denied responsibility for the Saudi attacks in a formal note sent to Washington. Diplomatically speaking, too, Iran is ahead. European governments supportive of the nuclear agreement rejected by Trump last year blame aggressive US policy for the current escalation. Britain does not say so in public, but Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is not so timid. “The deal to stop Iran acquiring military nuclear capabilities is a building block we need to get back to,” she said last week. This lack of a united front is damaging, as Trump may belatedly be realising. Inverting “America first” unilateralist rhetoric, he has ordered his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to try to assemble an anti-Iran “international coalition”. Suddenly Trump’s problem was the “world’s problem”. Pompeo is now saying the US seeks a “peaceful resolution” and is stressing non-military means to “mitigate” the crisis. Like the US plan for joint Gulf naval patrols, the idea of an American-led coalition has few takers – partly because US policy is so obviously wrong-headed. But doubts about Trump’s trustworthiness are also a factor. US claims in 2003 about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction turned out to be false. Many Europeans will question the credibility of accusations made against Iran by a proven serial liar. These doubts are shared by Saudi leaders, who reportedly do not wholly trust Trump to back them if war breaks out. Another uncomfortable truth is that Saudi princes and military chiefs, authors of the Yemen catastrophe, appear to be no match for an angry, cornered Iran. For the US, the Saudis are again proving to be problematic and needy partners.All told, Trump’s misconceived Iran policy has suffered a comprehensive, very public drubbing. So will the US take a deep breath and think again? Perhaps. The harshest reality laid bare by Trump’s week of dither is that the age-old fight between Iran and Saudi Arabia is not necessarily America’s fight – and few Americans believe that murderous Saudi royal despots are worth dying for.",Trump’s week of dithering over Iran makes America look weak and foolish,2019-09-21/12:30:29,they must be laughing their socks off in tehran the days following last

"The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said Washington and its allies were seeking a “peaceful resolution” with Iran in the wake of the attack on Saudi oil facilities, making clear that Washington would limit its initial response to further sanctions.Pompeo’s remarks, made on his return trip to Washington after visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, mark a significant cooling of rhetoric after Donald Trump had warned the US was “locked and loaded” and Pompeo had said the attack, which he blamed on Iran, was “an act of war”.The Pentagon said its goal was “to deter conflict and get back on the diplomatic path” and stopped short of definitively blaming Tehran for the air strikes which knocked out half Saudi Arabia’s oil production, deferring to Riyadh to make that assessment.“As of this time all indications are that Iran is in some way responsible,” spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said, before adding: “We’re not going to get ahead of the Saudi investigation in their assessment of this.”Iran has insisted the attack on a Saudi oil field and refinery was launched from Yemen by Houthi rebels, who have claimed responsibility. Any reprisal attack on Iran by the US or Saudi Arabia, Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned, would lead to “all-out war”.“I make a very serious statement about defending our country. I am making a very serious statement that we don’t want to engage in a military confrontation,” Zarif told CNN. “But we won’t blink to defend our territory.”Asked about Zarif’s comments, Pompeo sought to defuse the stand-off.“I was here in an act of diplomacy. While the foreign minister of Iran is threatening all-out war and to fight to the last American, we’re here to build out a coalition aimed at achieving peace and a peaceful resolution to this,” the secretary of state said. “That’s my mission set, what President Trump certainly wants me to work to achieve, and I hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran sees it the same way. There’s no evidence of that from his statement, but I hope that that’s the case.”Multiple reports from the White House have portrayed Trump as extremely reluctant to be drawn into another conflict as he campaigns for reelection while seeking to draw down troop levels in Afghanistan and Syria.Pompeo repeated Trump’s warning that Washington would impose further sanctions on Iran, which is already subject to a US oil and banking embargo, arguing that they were effective in cutting Iranian financing for its regional allies and its missile programme.“The president’s direction to us, to continue to prevent them having the capacity to underwrite Hizbullah, Shia militias in Iraq, their own missile program, all the things that they have done to pose a threat to the world, that’s the mission set with our economic sanctions,” he said.Pompeo was speaking after consulting Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and UAE prince Mohammed bin Zayed, the Trump administration’s closest allies in the region, particularly in the wake of Israeli elections that threw Binyamin Netanyahu’s political future in question.Trump had made clear that Saudi Arabia would have to take the lead role in any response for Saturday’s attacks. But Saudi officials have made it clear they did not want to trigger a full-scale conflict.The Pentagon said the focus of its own response was to explore “potential ways to look at mitigating future attacks”.Trump’s decision not to retaliate against Iran drew criticism from Republican hawks like the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who said that US inaction “was clearly seen by the Iranian regime as a sign of weakness”.Most Trump critics applauded US restraint, claiming that the US had under no obligation to Riyadh, but blamed Trump’s rhetorical bluster and his policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran for driving the region to the brink of conflict.“US inaction will be perceived as weakness,” said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy programme at the Brookings Institution. “Let me be clear: I’m not advocating war. The point is that [Trump] engaged in a stupid, unnecessary, incredibly dangerous bluff and the Iranians have called him on it.”",US dials back Iran rhetoric and seeks 'peaceful resolution' over Saudi attack,2019-09-19/19:18:06,the us secretary of state mike pompeo has said washington and its allies were seeking a peaceful resolution with iran in the wake of the attack on saudi oil facilities making clear that washington would limit its initial response to further sanctions pompeo s remarks made on his return trip to washington after visits to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates mark a significant cooling of rhetoric after donald trump had warned the us was locked and loaded and pompeo had said the attack which he blamed on iran was an act of war the pentagon said its goal was to deter conflict and get back on the diplomatic path and stopped short of definitively blaming tehran for the air strikes which knocked out half saudi arabia s oil production deferring to riyadh to make that assessment as of this time all indications are that iran is in some way responsible spokesman jonathan hoffman said before adding we re not going to get ahead of the saudi investigation in their assessment of this iran has insisted the attack on a saudi oil field and refinery was launched from yemen by houthi rebels who have claimed responsibility any reprisal attack on iran by the us or saudi arabia iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif warned would lead to all out war i make a very serious statement about defending our country i am making a very serious statement that we don t want to engage in a military confrontation zarif told cnn but we won t blink to defend our territory asked about zarif s comments pompeo sought to defuse the stand off i was here in an act of diplomacy while the foreign minister of iran is threatening all out war and to fight to the last american we re here to build out a coalition aimed at achieving peace and a peaceful resolution to this the secretary of state said that s my mission set what president trump certainly wants me to work to achieve and i hope that the islamic republic of iran sees it the same way there s no evidence of that from his statement but i hope that that s the case multiple reports from the white house have portrayed trump as extremely reluctant to be drawn into another conflict as he campaigns for reelection while seeking to draw down troop levels in afghanistan and syria pompeo repeated trump s warning that washington would impose further sanctions on iran which is already subject to a us oil and banking embargo arguing that they were effective in cutting iranian financing for its regional allies and its missile programme the president s direction to us to continue to prevent them having the capacity to underwrite hizbullah shia militias in iraq their own missile program all the things that they have done to pose a threat to the world that s the mission set with our economic sanctions he said pompeo was speaking after consulting saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman and uae prince mohammed bin zayed the trump administration s closest allies in the region particularly in the wake of israeli elections that threw binyamin netanyahu s political future in question trump had made clear that saudi arabia would have to take the lead role in any response for saturday s attacks but saudi officials have made it clear they did not want to trigger a full scale conflict the pentagon said the focus of its own response was to explore potential ways to look at mitigating future attacks trump s decision not to retaliate against iran drew criticism from republican hawks like the south carolina senator lindsey graham who said that us inaction was clearly seen by the iranian regime as a sign of weakness most trump critics applauded us restraint claiming that the us had under no obligation to riyadh but blamed trump s rhetorical bluster and his policy of maximum pressure on iran for driving the region to the brink of conflict us inaction will be perceived as weakness said suzanne maloney deputy director of the foreign policy programme at the brookings institution let me be clear i m not advocating war the point is that trump engaged in a stupid unnecessary incredibly dangerous bluff and the iranians have called him on it ,Iran Sanctions,0.346057922
"Iran’s foreign minister has warned that any attack on his country after a series of missile strikes on Saudi Arabia’s oil industry would result in “all-out war”.Javad Zarif also demanded that Riyadh hand over the evidence that it claimed proved the attack came from Iran, and not from Houthi-occupied Yemen.His remarks came as the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, became the first prominent European politician to suggest it was “not very credible” that the attack was mounted by the Houthis, as the rebels engaged in the civil war in Yemen have claimed.France has sent intelligence analysts to examine – alongside UN experts – the Saudi claims that the attack came from the north using technology and weaponry only available to Iran.Zarif’s threat of conflict in an interview with CNN appeared to be in response to the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who referred to the attack as an “act of war”.“I make a very serious statement about defending our country,” Zarif said. “I am making a very serious statement that we don’t want to engage in a military confrontation.”According to CNN, Zarif was unable to provide proof that Houthis launched the drones and missiles. “I cannot have any confidence that they did it because we just heard their statement,” he said. “I know that we didn’t do it. I know that the Houthis made a statement that they did it.”Zarif continued: “If they [the US] lift the sanctions that they re-imposed illegally then that’s a different situation, then we would consider [talks].”Pompeo, speaking to reporters accompanying him on his trip to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, insisted: “This was an Iranian attack. It’s not the case that you can subcontract out the devastation of 5% of the world’s global energy supply and think that you can absolve yourself from responsibility.“Were it the case that the Houthis’ fraudulent claim was accurate, were that true – it’s not, but were that true – it doesn’t change the fingerprints of the ayatollah as having put at risk the global energy supply.”Pompeo met the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in Jeddah to discuss an international response to Saturday’s attack. Saudi Arabia is looking for an international coalition to challenge Iran, and is reluctant to act alone, or only in concert with its key Gulf allies.The US is also discussing how to improve its Patriot missile defence system, which failed to prevent the mix of cruise and drone missiles reaching its target.In remarks to the press on his way home, Pompeo remarked of his trip to the Middle East: “I was here in an act of diplomacy. While the foreign minister of Iran is threatening all-out war and to fight to the last American, we’re here to build out a coalition aimed at achieving peace and a peaceful resolution to this.”Donald Trump, no longer dependent on Gulf oil imports and averse to Middle East wars, has been non-committal on whether he would order US military retaliation. So far he has focused on increasing the already onerous financial sanctions on Tehran over the attack. He has claimed there is plenty of time to undertake “dastardly acts” against Iran.The chief diplomatic option would be for the main European powers to put the Iran nuclear deal into review, a precursor to pulling out. The US controversially pulled out of the deal last year.The US is also considering to provide visas for Zarif and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, to attend the UN General Assembly in New York.Pompeo left Jeddah on Thursday heading to the UAE to meet Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The UAE is a close ally of Saudi Arabia, but has started to withdraw its troops from the war in Yemen against the Houthis.The UAE announced on Thursday that it had joined the US-led coalition to protect waterways across the Middle East after the attack on Saudi oil installations.Saudi Arabia joined the coalition on Wednesday; Australia, Bahrain and the UK also are taking part.

"Saudi Arabia has ramped up the pressure on Donald Trump to respond to a devastating strike on two major oil installations, displaying drone and missile technology it insisted showed the attack was “unquestionably sponsored by Iran”.At a press conference in Riyadh a Saudi defence spokesman claimed that 25 drones and cruise missiles were used in the attack on the Aramco facilities on Saturday, saying repeatedly they had been fired from the north, the direction of Iran.Asked for his response, Trump said “We know very much what happened” but argued that it was “a sign of strength” that he has thus far taken no military action against Iran.“How did going into Iraq work out?” Trump asked, then added: “There’s plenty of time to do some dastardly things. It’s very easy to start. And we’ll see what happens.”The UN secretary general, António Guterres, confirmed on Wednesday that an international team of experts was on the way to Saudi Arabia to investigate.Trump put the emphasis on further sanctions on Iran, tweeting on Wednesday morning that he had instructed the US treasury to “substantially increase” sanctions. He later told reporters he would provide details within the next 48 hours.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, arrived in Jeddah on Wednesday to confer with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, on a coordinated response.“We are working to build a coalition to develop a plan to deter them. This is what needs to happen. This is an attack on a scale that we’ve just not seen before,” Pompeo told journalists, describing the assault as “an act of war”.The Saudi press conference came on a day when:President Hassan Rouhani of Iran insisted the attack had been carried out by Houthi rebels in Yemen, and threatened to respond to any US military attacks.The Houthis held their own press conference to substantiate their claim of responsibility.And Trump discussed the crisis by phone with Boris Johnson, agreeing on “the need for a united diplomatic response”, according to No 10.At the Saudi press conference, Lt Col Turki al-Maliki said the country was still working to identify the precise launch point of the attack, but claimed the debris and data technology was of Iranian origin, and promised to share all the evidence with the UN and Saudi’s allies.He also repeatedly asserted it was the responsibility of the whole international community to respond, saying: “Iran’s continued aggression and continued support for militia groups harms us all.”He said Saudi Arabia had recently intercepted 282 ballistic missiles and 258 UAVs or drones. The bulk of these are likely to have come from Yemen.He added: “The cruise missiles used were of advanced capability, we have the date of the manufacture which is 2019 – Iran’s IRGC has this type of weaponry – all the evidence that we have gathered from the site proves that Iran’s weaponry was used in the attack.”The cruise missile could not reach the oil facilities if they had been fired from Yemen, he said. In his own comments to the press before landing in Jeddah, Pompeo claimed there was solid proof that Iran had carried out the attack.“This was an Iranian attack. It’s not the case that you can subcontract out the devastation of 5% of the world’s global energy supply and think that you can absolve yourself of responsibilities,” he said. “The intelligence community has high confidence that these were not weapons that would have been in the possession of the Houthis.”Pompeo stressed that the US aim was to bolster Saudi defences to prevent another attack, rather than retaliate for the air strikes on Saturday.“We want to work to make sure that infrastructure and resources are put in place such that attacks like this would be less successful than this one appears to have been,” he said.Despite the display of fallen ordnance, the Saudis have clearly not yet been able to make an unanswerable case that Iran was directly involved. At one point Al-Maliki said the missiles may have come from Yemen’s Houthi rebels, as Iran and the Houthis themselves assert.The show of weaponry came as the Saudi deputy defence minister, Khalid bin Salman, lavished praise on the US administration for confronting “the Iranian regime’s and terrorist organisations’ aggression in an unprecedented way”.But he also pointedly reminded the US that Barack Obama had committed the US in 2015 to an unequivocal policy “to use all elements of power to secure our core interests in the Gulf region and confront external aggression against our partners and our allies, as we did in the Gulf war”.Former Obama administration officials say this did not amount to a treaty, but a unilateral statement of US policy.Yemen has been troubled by civil wars for decades, but the current conflict intensified in March 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened on behalf of the internationally recognised government against Houthi rebels aligned with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.The war is widely regarded as having turned a poor country into a humanitarian catastrophe. Riyadh expected its air power, backed by regional coalition including the United Arab Emirates, could defeat the Houthi insurgency in a matter of months but instead it has triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with 80% of the population - more than 24 million people - requiring assistance or protection and more than 90,000 dead.Its roots lie in the Arab spring. Pro-democracy protesters took to the streets in a bid to force the president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to end his 33-year rule. He responded with economic concessions but refused to resign.By March 2011, tensions on the streets of the capital city, Sana’a, resulted in protesters dying at the hands of the military.Following an internationally brokered deal, there was a transfer of power in November to the vice-president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, paving the way for elections in February 2012 – in which he was the only candidate to lead a transitional government. Hadi’s attempts at constitutional and budget reforms were rejected by Houthi rebels from the north.The Houthis captured the capital, forcing Hadi to flee eventually to Riyadh.So far Trump has proved reluctant to use force to rein in Iran, although the US Treasury has been mounting an ever more exhaustive regime of sanctions on the country since the US pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal last year.US officials have reportedly presented a range of military responses to the president, prompting a formal written warning to Washington from Tehran that any US attack would lead to broader military retaliation.The Houthis staged their own press conference in which army spokesman Brig Gen Yahya Serie tried to substantiate their claim of responsibility for the attack. He said the weapons that targeted Aramco were Qasif K-2 cruise missiles and Samad 3 drones possessing a range of 1,700km (1,050 miles), and were launched from three sites and timed to reach their targets from different angles simultaneously.Versions of these weapons were displayed by the Houthis at a small arms exhibition on 7 July, but their true capability is unknown.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.

The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker, Grace 1, the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row. Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.Earlier, Iranian president said US claims that Tehran was involved in the attack on Saudi Arabian petroleum facilities were part of Washington’s continuing campaign to isolate Iran.In a defiant video address, Rouhani insisted the attack had been mounted by the Houthis, and blamed Saudi Arabia for starting the four-year war there. Rouhani said the Houthis attacked as a “warning” after attacks on hospitals, schools and markets in Yemen which have been blamed on the Saudi-led coalition.Saudi Arabaia has urged foreign countries to join the investigation into the culprits, and announced on Wednesday that it was joining the US-led maritime security force operating in the Gulf.So far European countries, as well as Saudi’s closest regional ally, the United Arab Emirates, have condemned the attack but are yet to attribute responsibility.Saudi news agencies reported that the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, rang the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Johnson and Trump also discussed the crisis by phone on Wednesday, and according to Downing Street discussed “the need for a united diplomatic response from international partners. They also spoke about Iran and agreed that they must not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon”.Saudi, criticised for its role in the war in Yemen and losing support on Capitol Hill, appears determined to try to build an international coalition and does not want to be left isolated in the event of a military confrontation with Tehran.

"Saturday’s attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities at Abqaiq represent a potential tipping point in regional and international relations. Although many questions remain, and Iran has officially denied responsibility, the likelihood of its involvement at some level is high. Regardless of the precise details, there is already a range of serious geopolitical implications to consider.If Tehran is responsible, this clearly demonstrates that Iran’s asymmetric military capabilities can pose a serious threat to the strategic interests of the west and its partners in the region. Oil-supply vulnerabilities are no longer limited to the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for exports and a repeated flashpoint over the years. After all, with this strike on a land-based facility, Saudi oil production reportedly dropped by about 50%. Tehran is potentially leveraging the lack of appetite among the US electorate for a new war in the Middle EastThese dramatic effects align with the current Iranian strategy of signalling to the US and its allies that there can be no such thing as a limited strike against Iran, as some contemplate in Washington: in such a scenario, Iran would retaliate, inflict significant cost and potentially provoke an all-out war. The attacks could also represent a further following-through on the promise that if Iran is prevented from exporting its own oil, it will disrupt the global oil market in return. It initially restricted this activity to the Strait of Hormuz. The Abqaiq attacks go way beyond this, however, embodying a determination to show that the Saudis will not be allowed to plug the gap left by Iranian oil that has been taken off the market as a result of sanctions.At this point, it should be clear that the regional status quo is simply not sustainable. Iran’s “strategic patience” over economic sanctions following the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal, aimed at giving Europe the chance to provide Iran with the promised economic dividends of that pact, has not borne fruit. Europe has been unable to provide sufficient sanctions relief after more than a year of trying. Iran now sees its position deteriorating, with little diplomatic progress and a weakening economy – and it is not prepared to allow this to happen quietly.President Trump has a number of issues to weigh as he considers his response. On the one hand, if he acts, he could potentially spark a war that he has said he doesn’t want, and which would violate his campaign promises. On the other hand, if he doesn’t act, he could be perceived as weak and ineffective. Either way, Tehran knows that Trump is under pressure because of the impending 2020 election campaign. It is likely using this moment to respond to US pressure with its own. Just as Washington has leveraged Tehran’s economic vulnerability on oil exports, Tehran is leveraging US vulnerabilities – specifically, the lack of appetite among its electorate for a new war in the Middle East.At the moment Trump’s position is ambiguous, which presents its own dangers. He stated on Twitter that the US military machine was “locked and loaded” in response to the attack, but later suggested that diplomacy was still an option. He indicated that he had authorised the release of oil reserves in an effort to “keep markets well-supplied”, but the next day claimed that the US was no longer dependent on Middle Eastern oil, downplaying the impact of the Saudi attack on the world’s oil markets.The conflicting messages are creating confusion for both allies and enemies. This matters because conflicting signals encourage miscalculations, particularly, in this case, on Tehran’s side. Iran has often pursued escalatory measures, but has generally held back from crossing a line that would provoke a wider military response. In the current context, those lines are blurred. Hardliners will be cheering the success of the attack and welcoming the leverage it may bring. Moderates will be calling for caution because of the extremely high stakes. One can imagine an Iranian miscalculation and an incident that leads to the loss of American life. That could become a game-changer and lead to war.In response to Saturday’s attack, some have urged the Trump administration to ratchet up the pressure on Iran, arguing that Tehran will only back down when confronted. Thus far, however, this has not been the case. Trump’s maximum-pressure strategy has had the opposite effect: the more pressure has been exerted, the riskier the strategies Tehran has pursued, simply because it is more desperate and feels it has less to lose.A deal proposed by French president Emmanuel Macron involving the extension of a $15bn credit line to Iran could allow all sides to save face. Earlier this year, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, stated that: “There will be no war; nor will we negotiate with the US.” The French initiative represents a viable exit strategy for de-escalation and fits nicely within Khamenei’s parameters. It doesn’t require the US to provide economic relief, allowing the Europeans to take the lead.Ultimately, whether or not Iran was behind the attack on Saudi Arabia, this situation presents a double-edged sword for Tehran: the effects of the attack and what it potentially signals about Iranian power could bolster Tehran’s position ahead of potential talks at the UN General Assembly. Alternatively, there is the risk of serious escalation – and at the very least, the possibility that the prospect of a return to the negotiating table, and ultimately relief from sanctions, will be undermined.• Mahsa Rouhi is a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Policy Programme","Whatever Iran’s role in the Saudi attack, the

"Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has announced there will be “no negotiations on any level” with US officials, in remarks aimed at dousing speculation of a possible summit between Donald Trump and Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the UN general assembly next week.As chances of any such diplomatic breakthrough dwindled, Washington announced that the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, would leave on Tuesday night for Jeddah for talks with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to discuss Saturday’s attacks on Saudi oil installations.The state department said it would “coordinate efforts to counter Iranian aggression in the region”.Pompeo is then due to fly to Abu Dhabi to see Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, which has backed the Saudi proposal of a UN inquiry to identify the perpetrators of the attacks. Both Saudi and US officials have said they believe Iranian weapons were involved in the attack, and the US media has quoted unnamed US sources as saying the air strikes were launched from southern Iran and involved a salvo of cruise missiles.But the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves le Drian, said he had no information on who was responsible. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, following a call with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, stressed the need to avoid further escalation.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has confined himself to condemning the attack and saying he is working to prepare a coordinated international response. That is likely to come at the UN general assembly next week, where world leaders including the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, Trump and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will all give speeches.The departure of the US national security adviser, John Bolton, an advocate of forceful anti-Iran policies, from the White House last week, along with the scheduled arrival of Rouhani in New York, had raised a faint possibility of renewed high-level talks between the two countries after months of escalating threats and military posturing.Trump appeared less keen for such a meeting in the wake of the weekend attack.“I never rule anything out, but I prefer not meeting him,” he told reporters on the way to a political rally on Tuesday.Speaking on the same day, the vice-president, Mike Pence, said the US was still considering its options“We’re evaluating all the evidence. We’re consulting with our allies. And the president will determine the best course of action in the days ahead,” Pence said. “But I promise you, under President Donald Trump, America will maintain our energy dominance. And the United States of America will take whatever action is necessary to defend our country, our troops and our allies in the Gulf. You can count on it.”Tehran had consistently said that it would only hold talks if the US lifted sanctions imposed since Trump left the 2015 nuclear deal. In remarks posted on his official website on Tuesday, Khamenei, Iran’s highest authority, restated that position in blunt terms. “If America takes back its words and repents and returns to the nuclear deal, which they have violated, they can take part in the meetings of signatories to this agreement with Iran,” Khamenei said. “Otherwise, no negotiation on any level will happen between officials of the Islamic Republic and America, neither in New York nor anywhere else.”In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondent Since pulling out of the 2015 nuclear agreement last year, the US has imposed a policy of maximum economic pressure on Tehran, including a commitment to drive Iranian oil exports to zero.But Trump appears determined to ensure that Saudi Arabia takes a leading role in any military response, a move that has led some security experts to suggest the US, no longer a net importer of oil, is unwilling to act automatically as the security guarantor for Saudi Arabia.On Tuesday, the Saudi energy minister said its oil output would be back to normal by the end of the month, claiming that half the production lost in the attack had already been restored.Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who was appointed to the role earlier this month, refused to be drawn on who was responsible for the strikes. “We don’t know who is behind the attack,” he said, adding that the kingdom wants “proof based on professionalism and internationally recognised standards”.He insisted the sale of Aramco – Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil group – would continue as planned, adding that the Saudis had large oil reserves that it could draw upon to supply the market if necessary. But Pierre Noël, an energy specialist at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: “The Saudis lost in 30 minutes the war for which they had been preparing for 30 years. Saudi Arabia lost 50% of their output due to Iran or its Iranian supporters.“It has happened without a war being waged, and crucially for Saudi Arabia without the US offering immediately an umbrella or delivering on what everyone expects since the 1970s that it would act as the guarantors of Saudi Arabian oil integrity. So we are talking about a major shift in Middle East oil geopolitics.”He added: “The timing from the Iranian perspective was brilliant since if Trump goes to war with Iran, the oil security crisis could have potentially quite dramatic macro-economic circumstances that could badly endanger the Trump re-election campaign. But if the US does not go to war, Saudi Arabia is humiliated.“The impact on the Aramco sale is incredible. How can you put an asset on a market that is incapable of protecting its physical integrity and is so dramatically exposed to single acts of war?”Kori Schake, the deputy director at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: “This is the destruction of Mohammed bin Salman’s strategy. What kind of foreign investment are you going to draw? He banked heavily on a personalised relationship with the Trump administration.”In the past four months, at least 13 oil tankers in the Gulf and the strait of Hormuz have been seized by Iranian forces or been targeted by acts of sabotage, starting on 12 May with the appearance of large holes in the hulls of four ships docked in Fujairah, one of the United Arab Emirates. The US and Saudi Arabia have repeatedly accused Iran of perpetrating the damage.

"Donald Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton wants the United States to go to war with Iran.We know this because he has been saying it for nearly two decades.And everything that the Trump administration has done over its Iran policy, particularly since Bolton became Trump’s top foreign policy adviser in April of 2018, must be viewed through this lens, including the alarming US military posturing in the Middle East of the past two weeks.Just after one month on the job, Bolton gave Trump the final push he needed to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement, which at the time was (and still is, for now) successfully boxing in Iran’s nuclear program and blocking all pathways for Iran to build a bomb. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – as the Iran deal is formally known – was the biggest obstacle to Bolton’s drive for a regime change war, because it eliminated a helpful pretext that served so useful to sell the war in Iraq 17 years ago.Since walking away from the deal, the Trump administration has claimed that with a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, it can achieve a “better deal” that magically turns Iran into a Jeffersonian democracy bowing to every and any American wish. But this has always been a fantastically bad-faith argument meant to obscure the actual goal (regime change) and provide cover for the incremental steps – the crushing sanctions, bellicose rhetoric, and antagonizing military maneuvers – that have now put the United States closer to war with Iran than it has been since at least the latter half of the Bush administration, or perhaps ever.And Bolton has no qualms about manipulating or outright ignoring intelligence to advance his agenda, which is exactly what’s happening right now.In his White House statement 10 days ago announcing (an already pre-planned) carrier and bomber deployment to the Middle East, Bolton cited “a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings” from Iran to justify the bolstered US military presence. But multiple sources who have seen the same intelligence have since said that Bolton and the Trump administration blew it “out of proportion, characterizing the threat as more significant than it actually was”. Even a British general operating in the region pushed back this week, saying he has seen no evidence of an increased Iranian threat.What’s even more worrying is that Bolton knows what he’s doing. He’s “a seasoned bureaucratic infighter who has the skills to press forcefully for his views” – and he has a long history of using those skills to undermine American diplomacy and work toward killing arms control agreements.As a senior official in the George W Bush administration, he played key role in the collapse of the Agreed Framework, the Clinton-era deal that froze North Korea’s plutonium nuclear program (the North Koreans tested their first bomb four years later).He said he “felt like a kid on Christmas day” after he orchestrated the US withdrawal from the international criminal court in 2002. And now as a senior official in the Trump administration, he pushed for the US to withdrawal from a crucial nuclear arms treaty with Russia.While it’s unclear how much of a role he played in scuttling Trump’s negotiations with Kim Jong-un in Hanoi last year, he publicly called for the so-called “Libya model” with the North Koreans (in other words, regime change by force). Just months before joining the administration, he tried to make the legal case for a preventive war against Pyongyang. And if you think he cares about the aftermath of war with North Korea, he doesn’t. Bolton was reportedly “unmoved” by a presentation during his time in the Bush administration of the catastrophic consequences of such a war. “I don’t do war. I do policy,” he said then.So far, Bolton has been successful in moving the United States toward his desired outcome with Iran – if getting the Pentagon to draw up plans to send 120,000 US troops to the region to confront Iran is any indication. There are hopeful signs that we can avoid war, as US officials and our European allies, seemingly alarmed by what Bolton is up to, are sounding the alarm about the Trump administration skewing intelligence on Iran.But Bolton is on a fast track, seemingly aware that Trump’s time in office may be limited. The question, ultimately, is whether the president can stick to his instincts of avoiding more military conflict, or acquiesce to a man hellbent on boxing him into a corner with no way out other than war with Iran.Ben Armbruster is the communications director for Win Without War and previously served as National Security Editor at ThinkProgress",Is John Bolton the most dangerous man in the

"It was a deception that would lead to millions of civilian deaths, and the deaths of nearly 60,000 US soldiers. In August 1964 President Lyndon B Johnson solemnly declared that, after two apparent North Vietnamese attacks on US navy destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin, military action would take place.Four years later, Senator Albert Gore – father of Bill Clinton’s future vice-president – warned in a closed Foreign Relations Committee session that, “If this country has been misled … the consequences are very great.” His suspicions were correct. The second Gulf of Tonkin attack might never have happened – and perhaps neither did. Communications to make it look like the attack occurred had been falsified. But US policy was already set on a dramatic escalation of the Vietnam war: and here was the perfect pretext.This week it emerged that the US government is discussing sending up to 120,000 troops to the Middle East for possible military action against Iran. “We’ll see what happens with Iran,” declared President Trump. “If they do anything, it will be a bad mistake.” The principal driving force behind this is Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, a man who thinks there is no problem to which the answer isn’t war: in the Bush era, his militarism was too much for the commander-in-chief who laid waste to Iraq. You can see them scrabbling for excuses already: the Trump administration says Iran-backed proxy groups are preparing attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria, a claim forcefully denied this week by British major-general Christopher Ghika, the deputy commander of counter-terror operations in both countries. The US has blamed Iran, without evidence, for damage to Saudi oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Could an Iranian Gulf of Tonkin be looming?It is easy to dismiss these fears as alarmist. Is Trump not the man who confounded his critics by seeking peace on the Korean peninsula? Trump boasts that he “actually tempers” Bolton; Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, states: “There won’t be any war.” As Sanam Vakil, a research fellow at Chatham House, tells me: “Both sides are posturing, sending [threats] back and forth, and I don’t think heading for any direct military interventions.” Bolton, she reassures me, is just one of many voices in the room, and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo himself says that the US is not seeking war.But, but, but. Trump’s presidential campaign nurtured the myth that he was the “dovish” candidate in contrast to “hawkish” Hillary Clinton (and this is no defence of Clinton, who once crowed that the US could “totally obliterate” Iran). Trump has dramatically increased the use of drone warfare; and he rained down missiles on Syria. He withdrew US support for the successful Iranian nuclear deal in defiance of his then defence secretary and secretary of state, and has sought to throttle Iran with sanctions. US politicians are ramping up the rhetoric: a Republican senator brags that the US could win a war with Iran with “two strikes: the first strike and a last strike”.A senior Senate aide tells me that the triumph of Bolton’s plans is all too conceivable: Bolton could exploit Trump’s ignorance of policy, an area in which he excels. While any war would not be popular with Trump’s base he could be convinced by Bolton that it is possible to escalate up to a point, then pull back at the brink: but by then it may be impossible to do so. Rightwing thinktanks and broadcasters are already hyping up links between Iran and al-Qaida.The consequences of an Iranian conflagration should horrify us. Dan Plesch – a specialist at Soas University of London’s Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy – details the US air and naval power potentially ranged against Iran: it’s what one of his colleagues describes as “a tsunami of precision-guided molten metal”. The “lethality of US force”, says Plesch, “to very rapidly destroy military, civil, political and economic infrastructure is hugely underestimated” – and is far greater than in 2003. The US would seek to impose a government-in-exile with no roots in the country; a bloody balkanisation could follow. Iran would mobilise its regional influence – dramatically increased by the Iraq catastrophe – raising the prospect of wider regional conflict.The risk is already too real for us to wait and see before acting. Pressure must be exerted by the public on US allies to declare their total opposition to any war with Iran, including not permitting their military bases to be used. The mass protests that will greet Trump’s visit in three weeks’ time must include demands that no British support for such a bloody adventure be offered. Feeling blasé about the danger?

"Germany and the Netherlands have suspended their military training programmes in Iraq because of a perceived security threat in the wake of rising US-Iranian tensions in the region.The announcements came after the US embassy in Baghdad ordered all but emergency staff to leave Iraq. No details of the supposed security threat were provided.A German defence ministry spokesman, Jens Flosdorff, said that by pausing its small-scale training missions north of Baghdad and the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, Germany was “orienting itself toward our partner countries, which have taken this step”.However, Flosdorff said the move was not a response to a “concrete threat” but rather to a general security situation being viewed as more tense.The Dutch public broadcaster, NOS, reported that the country’s 50-strong mission, mostly involved in training Kurdish fighters, had been halted “until further orders”, but quoted a defence ministry spokesman as saying he could not elaborate on the nature of the threat.German and Dutch officials did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday morning. Neither country has followed the US example and withdrawn diplomats from their embassies in Iraq.In their public pronouncements, European capitals have generally voiced anxiety at the rising US-Iranian tensions, but European diplomats overwhelmingly blame the Donald Trump administration for seeking to provoke a confrontation. US allies have conspicuously avoided echoing US claims of an imminent threat from Iran.The UK and US military have given strikingly different views of the security situation for coalition forces in Iraq and Syria. The UK defence ministry stood by British Maj Gen Christopher Ghika, who was rebuked by US central command on Tuesday for insisting there was no increased threat from Iranian-aligned militias in the region.“Maj Gen Ghika speaks as a military officer in the US-led coalition focused on the fight against Daesh [Isis] in Iraq and Syria. His comments are based on the day to day military operations and his sole focus is the enduring defeat of Daesh,” the ministry said in a statement, which did not directly address the question of whether the security threat had increased.“He made clear in his Pentagon briefing that “there are a range of threats to American and coalition forces in this part of the world. There always have been, that is why we have a very robust range of force protection measures. The UK has long been clear about our concerns over Iran’s destabilising behaviour in the region.”The New York Times on Wednesday quoted an unnamed American official as saying an increased Iranian threat was “small stuff” that did not merit the military build-up advocated by the national security adviser, John Bolton. The official said the “ultimate goal of the year-long economic sanctions campaign by the Trump administration was to draw Iran into an armed conflict with the United States”, according to the report.Democrats in Congress have raised similar concerns, pointing to the parallels between the current US actions and the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, in which Bolton played a supporting role.“Iran is and has been for decades a malevolent actor and a state sponsor of terror,” Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, told the Washington Post. “But I’m also gravely concerned about actions taken by the administration that appear calculated to put us on a collision course.”In recent days there have been sabotage attacks against oil tankers, two of them Saudi-owned, in the Persian Gulf, and Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for drone strikes against Saudi oil installations. The Houthis receive backing from Iran but most experts say they are not directly controlled from Tehran.Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, insisted that “no one is seeking war”, but in the same speech he also ruled out negotiations with the US, saying such talks would be “poison” – an apparent response to Trump’s suggestion that the Iranian leadership call him directly.Khamenei also repeated Iran’s threat to enrich uranium beyond the 3.67% limit agreed in a multilateral nuclear deal in 2015, which Trump abrogated last year, if US does not ease its oil embargo and other sanctions. He made clear Iran could even go beyond its previous boundary of 20% enrichment, beyond which it becomes increasingly easy to attain weapons grade, above 90%.“Achieving 20% enrichment is the most difficult part,” Khamenei said, according to an Iranian press report. “The next steps are easier than this step.”",Germany and Netherlands halt training schemes in Iraq as tensions rise,2019-05-15/16:32:18,germany and the netherlands have suspended their military training programmes in iraq because of a perceived security threat in the wake of rising us iranian tensions in the region the announcements came after the us embassy in baghdad ordered all but emergency staff to leave iraq no details of the supposed security threat were provided a german defence ministry spokesman jens flosdorff said that by pausing its small scale training missions north of baghdad and the kurdish region of northern iraq germany was orienting itself toward our partner countries which have taken this step however flosdorff said the move was not a response to a concrete threat but rather to a general security situation being viewed as more tense the dutch public broadcaster nos reported that the country s  strong mission mostly involved in training kurdish fighters had been halted until further orders but quoted a defence ministry spokesman as saying he could not elaborate on the nature of the threat german and dutch officials did not respond to requests for comment on wednesday morning neither country has followed the us example and withdrawn diplomats from their embassies in iraq in their public pronouncements european capitals have generally voiced anxiety at the rising us iranian tensions but european diplomats overwhelmingly blame the donald trump administration for seeking to provoke a confrontation us allies have conspicuously avoided echoing us claims of an imminent threat from iran the uk and us military have given strikingly different views of the security situation for coalition forces in iraq and syria the uk defence ministry stood by british maj gen christopher ghika who was rebuked by us central command on tuesday for insisting there was no increased threat from iranian aligned militias in the region maj gen ghika speaks as a military officer in the us led coalition focused on the fight against daesh isis in iraq and syria his comments are based on the day to day military operations and his sole focus is the enduring defeat of daesh the ministry said in a statement which did not directly address the question of whether the security threat had increased he made clear in his pentagon briefing that there are a range of threats to american and coalition forces in this part of the world there always have been that is why we have a very robust range of force protection measures the uk has long been clear about our concerns over iran s destabilising behaviour in the region the new york times on wednesday quoted an unnamed american official as saying an increased iranian threat was small stuff that did not merit the military build up advocated by the national security adviser john bolton the official said the ultimate goal of the year long economic sanctions campaign by the trump administration was to draw iran into an armed conflict with the united states according to the report democrats in congress have raised similar concerns pointing to the parallels between the current us actions and the buildup to the  invasion of iraq in which bolton played a supporting role iran is and has been for decades a malevolent actor and a state sponsor of terror adam schiff the chairman of the house intelligence committee told the washington post but i m also gravely concerned about actions taken by the administration that appear calculated to put us on a collision course in recent days there have been sabotage attacks against oil tankers two of them saudi owned in the persian gulf and houthi rebels in yemen claimed responsibility for drone strikes against saudi oil installations the houthis receive backing from iran but most experts say they are not directly controlled from tehran iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei insisted that no one is seeking war but in the same speech he also ruled out negotiations with the us saying such talks would be poison an apparent response to trump s suggestion that the iranian leadership call him directly khamenei also repeated iran s threat to enrich uranium beyond the   limit agreed in a multilateral nuclear deal in  which trump abrogated last year if us does not ease its oil embargo and other sanctions he made clear iran could even go beyond its previous boundary of  enrichment beyond which it becomes increasingly easy to attain weapons grade above  achieving  enrichment is the most difficult part khamenei said according to an iranian press report the next steps are easier than this step ,Iran Sanctions,0.373877674
"The Iranian ambassador to the UK has warned Europe it has 60 days to ease Iranian oil sales or else see the end of the nuclear deal as tensions rise with the US.Hamid Baeidinejad claimed it was obvious for all to see that the US national security adviser, John Bolton, was bent on a military confrontation with Iran, and the only question was whether Washington would be caught in his trap.Speaking five days after Iran announced steps to withdraw from the nuclear deal negotiated in 2015, which the US earlier pulled out of, the ambassador also insisted that Iran was not involved in the sabotage of two Saudi oil tankers in the Oman Gulf at the weekend.“We do not know who attacked the tankers. It’s very serious for us. For hours after the incident, the United Arab Emirates declined to give any comment and then, all of a sudden, in a concerted effort, statement after statement was made that Iran or its so-called proxies were likely to be engaged. This is very dangerous and suspicious,” he said.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentFollowing the US announcement it would send the fleet led by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to the Gulf, Baeidinejad said: “We were predicting there could be some incidents, accidents and some probabilities … a pretext to start a military escalation.”He said “sections in Washington led by John Bolton” wanted “to drag America into a military confrontation with Iran”, but Iran would be prepared.“Iran does not want to have a war, and is not predicting one, but we are very prepared for any eventuality and people should not test the seriousness of the Iranian people to react very fiercely against provocations in the region,” he said.“All the Iranian people are behind the government and leadership, even groups and circles previously opposed to the government. We have a very solid domestic position. Any miscalculation by the other side would be very damaging.”The nuclear deal was intended to lift economic sanctions on Iran in return for it limiting its nuclear activities and allowing international inspection. But since Donald Trump took the US out of the agreement, US secondary sanctions and the removal of all oil export waivers have reduced Iranian oil exports by to 1m barrels per day (BPD) or less from a peak of 2.8m bBPD. Exports could fall as low as 500,000 BPD in May.Baeidinejad, who played a part in negotiating the nuclear deal, stressed the Iranian steps last week were born of exasperation at Europe’s failure to deliver on its side of the deal, also known as joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), a failure he said the Europeans acknowledged.“If in 60 days there are no solutions, there certainly will be consequences from our side and it will be very serious. We are determined to take action to salvage the nuclear deal or else there is no future for the deal.” He made no bones that the steps announced by his government reflected internal political pressure to stand up to the US.“Even in Iran there are many institutions and politicians that believe we have been late in responding to the situation,” he said. “We have tried to be patient over a year, but we cannot continue to allow the JCPOA to be in a total collapse so something needed to be done. If the other side believe that Iran can just continue to be patient, we have passed that stage.“Our government is expected by its people to respond to the negative developments that have occurred. It is time we should make some decision – not to undermine the nuclear deal but give the necessary message to the international community that the JCPOA is under immediate threat. The fundamental achievement of multilateral diplomacy is in danger of collapse.”Although the ambassador said the EU was required by Iran within 60 days to take concrete steps, or else see more unambiguous action by Iran to depart the JCPOA, he was sometimes elusive about the precise steps Europe must take.He referred repeatedly to EU states doing more to help with the export of Iranian oil and the transfer to Iran of the revenue from the sales. But a mechanism – Instex - set up by the EU to circumvent US secondary sanctions is designed for humanitarian aid, not oil trading.Baeidinejad said: “The three European countries have not been able to implement their part of the agreement due to the sanctions by the US – if they would tell us now they don’t care about the US, that they will import our oil and transfer the necessary money and operationalise the Instex that would be the solution we are expecting.“There are actual buyers outside ready to buy Iranian oil but there are threats, intimidations and sanctions against companies that want to work with Iran. We need definite commitments and answers.”","Ease oil sales or see end of nuclear deal, Iran says",2019-05-14/19:20:51,the iranian ambassador to the uk has warned europe it has  days to ease iranian

"A festering four-year war, crippling sanctions, threats to maritime oil trade and a US naval battlegroup steaming for the Persian Gulf. Such developments were troubling enough, before two Saudi tankers were reportedly sabotaged off the UAE coast on Sunday – a development set to ratchet tensions between Tehran and Washington to new and combustible highs.With Riyadh claiming significant hull damage to its ships and the UAE claiming the damage was done inside its territorial waters, what last week was a looming standoff is now a real-time crisis with potent implications for both global energy security and regional stability.Throughout Donald Trump’s presidency, staring down Iran has been top of the agenda among many to have passed through the revolving door of his inner circle. For the current uber-hawks, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the national security adviser, John Bolton, there has hardly been a higher calling. Both have been pivotal in focusing Trump on Iran, and imposing new comprehensive sanctions on its economy. And both drove the bellicose rhetoric that last week spelled out the same scenario to which the region awoke on Monday.According to Riyadh, one of the “sabotaged” tankers was en route to a Saudi port to upload oil to be exported to the US. Stopping such a shipment would be consistent with an act of revenge for crippling Iranian exports and for making good on threats to disrupt global energy routes – although on Monday Iran vehemently denied playing a role.Bolton’s prediction of a “credible threat” from Iran, or its proxies, to the oil interests of Washington, or its allies, however looks prophetic in the royal courts of the Gulf. And what regional officials are calling a “terrorist attack” is certain to similarly energise a White House that has at times appeared to be itching for a confrontation with a foe it now faces in most corners of the Middle East.Iran has steadily become the sum of all fears in the eyes of the US and its regional allies; its creeping influence across the Arab world, belligerence towards Israel and perceived readiness to act on its threats to a decades old regional order, which – not without irony – was upended by the US invasion of Iraq.Trump’s backers ignore the Bush administration’s intervention, blaming instead Barack Obama’s pivot towards Iran and his signature nuclear deal for kickstarting Iran’s adventurism. While Obama’s gestures were hardly seen in Tehran as trust-building measures and did nothing to slow a regional consolidation, Iran’s ascendancy started before him and has continued since.Tehran’s view has been rather different. It views the US as a capricious actor whose presence and interventions has destabilised the region for decades. In Trump’s America, it sees a player with the same sort of ideological zeal that it is accused of wielding itself. A self appointed global sheriff not worthy of the badge and to whom it can never bow.The ill-fated reality of 2003 gave Tehran a bridgehead in Iraq and a springboard into Syria that, nearly eight years into the civil war, has brought the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps to within striking distance of Israel’s north. Iran’s proxies have also helped weigh down Saudi Arabia in Yemen, lay the foundations for a parallel state in Iraq and energise a still rumbling opposition movement in Shia-majority Bahrain.The loaded geopolitics have rarely strayed far from oil though. And with Iran’s embattled economy dependent on oil exports and the US once again enthusiastic for Saudi crude, a flashpoint in the Strait of Hormuz, through which 35% of the world’s oil is shipped, has long been likely.Tensions have been boiling since the Trump administration’s decision to lift sanctions waivers from eight countries that import Iranian oil. The stated goal of this was to collapse Iran’s exports to “zero”. Exports had already taken a hit when Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal signed by his predecessor last November – partly in the hope of renegotiating a better deal. Ever since, Iran has prevaricated on its own commitment to a multilateral pact, which delivered revenue streams and global legitimacy, albeit briefly. Last week, Iran said it would no longer honour parts of the deal and had no interest in discussing a revised version.Several things are abundantly clear though; sanctions, including banking restrictions, are hitting the Iranian economy hard, limiting its capacity to sustain its people, or allies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, where fighters have taken substantial pay cuts in recent months. More importantly though, Iran cannot let itself be seen to capitulate to the US moves. To do so would risk far more than its post-2003 gains.Washington appears to be betting on just such a surrender, and has pushed brinkmanship to its limits. On Monday, it warned US citizens in Iraq and elsewhere in the region to be vigilant.

"Saudi Arabia has said two of its oil tankers have been damaged in mysterious “sabotage attacks” in the Gulf, as the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, held emergency talks with his European counterparts about mounting tensions in the region.The United Arab Emirates said on Sunday that four commercial vessels had been sabotaged near Fujairah emirate, outside the Strait of Hormuz. The UAE did not give the ships’ nationalities or any other details about the vessels’ ownership, but Riyadh identified two of them as Saudi, and a Norwegian company said it owned another. The fourth ship was reportedly the A Michel, a storage tanker flagged in Sharjah, one of the UAE’s seven emirates.Escalating rhetoric in the region and in the US has raised fears of a confrontation between Iran and the US, which is backed by its key Gulf allies, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The US state department billed Pompeo’s talks in Brussels as a chance “to discuss recent threatening actions and statements” by Iran.No side has taken responsibility for the alleged acts of sabotage. Iran called for an investigation into the incident and spoke of “adventurism” by foreign players to disrupt maritime security.The Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said the incident involving the two Saudi-owned vessels occurred on Sunday at 6am. Riyadh had yet to produce photographic evidence of damage.Thome Ship Management said its Norwegian-registered oil products tanker MT Andrew Victory was “struck by an unknown object”. Footage seen by Reuters showed a hole in the hull at the waterline with the metal torn open inwards.The cause of the damage and type of weapon used remains a mystery. If the cause was a device in the water, the only reported – and comparable – use of such devices in the region recently has been the deployment by Houthi rebels of naval mines, several dozen of which been deployed in the conflict in Yemen, including at least one improvised sea mine.Houthis have also targeted Saudi oil facilities with missiles in the past including four missiles fired at the Saudi Aramco facilities on the Red Sea last year.Jeremy Hunt, the UK foreign secretary, called for calm in the Gulf, as he said there was a danger of conflict erupting by accident.A Saudi government source said: “This criminal act constitutes a serious threat to the security and safety of maritime navigation and adversely impacts regional and international peace and security.”Falih said one of the two Saudi vessels was on its way to be loaded with Saudi crude oil from the port of Ras Tanura, to be delivered to Saudi Aramco’s customers in the US. “Fortunately, the attack didn’t lead to any casualties or oil spill; however, it caused significant damage to the structures of the two vessels,” he added.Shipping industry sources identified the Saudi vessels as the large crude carrier tanker Amjad and crude tanker Al Marzoqah, owned by Bahri, Saudi’s national shipping carrier, which has yet to comment.Fujairah port is the only Emirati terminal located on the Arabian Sea coast, bypassing the Strait of Hormuz, through which most Gulf oil exports pass. Almost all oil exports of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Iran itself – at least 15m barrels per day – are shipped through the strait. The world’s largest crude oil storage centre is also being built in Fujairah.Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the strait in the case of a military confrontation with the US. The US has largely dismissed the threat, but has dispatched an aircraft carrier to the region as President Donald Trump seeks to isolate Tehran by cutting off its oil exports after pulling out of a 2015 deal aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme.Oil prices rose on world markets on Monday with benchmark Brent North Sea crude up 1.8% at $71.90 (£55.18) a barrel in London.Adding to the sense of confusion, the UAE had on Sunday categorically denied reports on Iranian and pro-Hezbollah Lebanese social media of massive explosions in oil tankers off the coast of Fujairah, whose port on Monday was calm with no signs of damage.The increasing tensions come after Iran said on Wednesday it had stopped respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed in 2015 with the US, the EU, China and Russia. Tehran said it was responding to the failure of the EU to combat sweeping unilateral sanctions that Washington has reimposed since it quit the agreement one year ago.The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said he had told Pompeo during their Monday meeting: “We do not want it to come to a military conflict [between the US and Iran].”Maas avoided any public criticism of Washington, saying both sides wanted to ensure peace in the Middle East. But he said it was clear that Europe and the US were “going about it in different ways ... taking different courses”.Before his meeting with Pompeo, France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, urged Europeans to remain united in support of the nuclear deal, which was signed by the US, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia, and which the EU helped to negotiate.Additional reporting by

"The deployment of a US aircraft carrier to Iran’s regional waters is nothing but psychological warfare and part of a plan to intimidate Tehran, the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, Gen Hossein Salami, has told parliamentarians in a closed-door session.The IRGC commander said a US war against Iran was impossible, claiming Washington lacked the necessary military strength.Another senior commander claimed Iran had the firepower to “hit the US in the head” during the session in Tehran on Sunday. The combined remarks represent another ratcheting up of the bellicose rhetoric between Washington and Tehran, since Iran began a partial withdrawal last week from 2015 the nuclear deal.The withdrawal is designed to put pressure on Europe to help ease US economic sanctions, as well as reassure Iranians that the government will resist Donald Trump.Salami was appointed head of the IRGC last month and is seen as critical to how prepared Iran might be to test US military resolve.The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, carrying up to 40 strike aircraft, has been deployed to the Gulf.The head of the IRGC aerospace division, Amirali Hajizadeh, said: “An aircraft carrier that has at least 40 to 50 planes on it and 6,000 forces gathered within it was a serious threat for us in the past, but now … the threats have switched to opportunities.“If [the Americans] make a move, we will hit them in the head.”Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in a tweet on Sunday that the US national security adviser, John Bolton, had laid plans for the US to withdraw from the nuclear deal and take a more aggressive posture toward the Islamic Republic even before he took up his current post.Zarif tweeted a link to a 2017 National Review article written by Bolton entitled How to Get Out of the Iran Nuclear Deal.“A detailed blueprint for #FakeIntelligence, #ForeverWar and even empty offers for talks – only phone numbers were not included,” Zarif wrote on Twitter.CNN reported on Friday that the White House had passed a telephone number to Switzerland for contacting Trump in case Iranian officials want to hold talks.Iran has given the EU 60 days to come up with fresh measures to dilute the impact of US sanctions, or else it will take fresh steps to leave the agreement, including increasing levels of uranium enrichment.Although EU leaders blame the US for forcing Tehran to retaliate, it is urging Iran not to take the steps now threatened since they might be seen as legally breaching the deal’s terms.The US withdrew from the deal a year ago, but the EU, Russia and China have remained committed, saying there is no evidence Tehran has breached its terms.Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Iran still hoped Europe and China might “pull something out of the hat” to save the deal by easing sanctions. She added that Tehran had wild expectations of what the EU might be able to do to protect Iran from the effects of US sanctions.","US war against Iran is impossible, claims Iranian general",2019-05-12/18:49:58,the deployment of a us aircraft carrier to iran s regional waters is nothing but psychological warfare and part of a plan to intimidate tehran the head of the revolutionary guards corps gen hossein salami has told parliamentarians in a closed door session the irgc commander said a us war against iran was impossible claiming washington lacked the necessary military strength another senior commander claimed iran had the firepower to hit the us in the head during the session in tehran on sunday the combined remarks represent another ratcheting up of the bellicose rhetoric between washington and tehran since iran began a partial withdrawal last week from  the nuclear deal the withdrawal is designed to put pressure on europe to help ease us economic sanctions as well as reassure iranians that the government will resist donald trump salami was appointed head of the irgc last month and is seen as critical to how prepared iran might be to test us military resolve the aircraft carrier uss abraham lincoln carrying up to  strike aircraft has been deployed to the gulf the head of the irgc aerospace division amirali hajizadeh said an aircraft carrier that has at least  to  planes on it and   forces gathered within it was a serious threat for us in the past but now the threats have switched to opportunities if the americans make a move we will hit them in the head iran s foreign minister mohammad javad zarif said in a tweet on sunday that the us national security adviser john bolton had laid plans for the us to withdraw from the nuclear deal and take a more aggressive posture toward the islamic republic even before he took up his current post zarif tweeted a link to a  national review article written by bolton entitled how to get out of the iran nuclear deal a detailed blueprint for fakeintelligence foreverwar and even empty offers for talks only phone numbers were not included zarif wrote on twitter cnn reported on friday that the white house had passed a telephone number to switzerland for contacting trump in case iranian officials want to hold talks iran has given the eu  days to come up with fresh measures to dilute the impact of us sanctions or else it will take fresh steps to leave the agreement including increasing levels of uranium enrichment although eu leaders blame the us for forcing tehran to retaliate it is urging iran not to take the steps now threatened since they might be seen as legally breaching the deal s terms the us withdrew from the deal a year ago but the eu russia and china have remained committed saying there is no evidence tehran has breached its terms ellie geranmayeh an iran expert at the european council on foreign relations said iran still hoped europe and china might pull something out of the hat to save the deal by easing sanctions she added that tehran had wild expectations of what the eu might be able to do to protect iran from the effects of us sanctions ,Iran Sanctions,0.259558022
"Donald Trump has offered Iran direct talks, saying its leaders should “call me” and suggested the US would help revive the country’s economy as long as Iran did not acquire nuclear weapons.The impromptu offer by the US president, if serious, represents a dramatic lowering of the bar set by his administration for lifting extensive sanctions, including an oil embargo. Iran is already party to a 2015 agreement that strictly limits its nuclear programme and places it under close scrutiny. Trump withdrew the US from the Obama-era treaty a year ago.“What I’d like to see with Iran, I’d like to see them call me,” Trump said. He pointed out the Iranian economy was in a shambles as a result of the pressure from the US.“What they should be doing is calling me up, sitting down and we can make a deal, a fair deal,” Trump said. “We just don’t want them to have nuclear weapons. It’s not too much to ask. And we would help put them back into great shape.”The Trump administration has previously insisted Iran would have to fulfil a list of 12 wide-ranging conditions, including non-intervention in Syria, Yemen and Iraq, in order for sanctions to be lifted. Trump’s remarks suggested that a new deal on the nuclear programme would be enough.The new Iranian ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht Ravanchi, immediately responded by saying Iran had no interest in developing nuclear weapons.“The first question that he has to answer is why he left the negotiating table because we were talking to all participants of the nuclear deal, including the US,” Ravanchi told NBC News. “So all of a sudden he decided to leave the negotiating table … What is the guarantee that he will not renege again on the future talks between Iran and the US?”In his remarks, Trump accused former secretary of state John Kerry of telling Iran not to negotiate with his administration, which he claimed was a violation of the Logan Act, which bans private individuals from negotiating with foreign states.The allegation was denied by a spokesman for Kerry’s office, who told CNN: “Everything President Trump said today is simply wrong, end of story. He’s wrong about the facts, wrong about the law, and sadly he’s been wrong about how to use diplomacy to keep America safe.”Asked why the US had sent an aircraft carrier to the Middle East in response to allegedly menacing behaviour by Iran, Trump said: “They were threatening and we have information that you don’t want to know about. They were very threatening and we just want to have … great security for this country and for a lot of other places.”And on the question of whether there could be a military confrontation, he replied: “I guess you could say that always, right? I don’t want to say no, but hopefully that won’t happen. We have one of the most powerful ships in the world that is loaded up and we don’t want to do anything.”Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, has been pushing an aggressive stance towards Iran and made the announcement of the military deployments, but the Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Bolton has irritated Trump over his involvement in a failed effort to oust the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro.“John .. has strong views on things, but that’s OK. I actually temper John, which is pretty amazing, isn’t it?” Trump joked to reporters on Thursday.The president made his remarks at a time of rising tensions over the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran announced its intention to violate elements of the agreement on Wednesday, in response to what it said was the failure of the US and other state parties to meet their side of the bargain by relaxing sanctions. The EU and the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain have said they would not accept ultimatums from Iran over the nuclear deal, but admitted to sharp differences with the US over how to change Tehran’s behaviour.The European leaders, increasingly hampered by the US’s determination to weaken Iran, also said they were still committed to the deal and did not at this stage see threats from Tehran to loosen its obligations as being in breach of the agreement.On Wednesday the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, reduced Iran’s obligations under the deal and said his country would take further steps in 60 days on uranium enrichment if the EU did not do more to help the Iranian oil and banking sector. In its initial step, Tehran said it would no longer limit its stocks of heavy water or low-enriched uranium.The EU said in response: “We reject any ultimatums and we will assess Iran’s compliance on the basis of Iran’s performance regarding its nuclear-related commitments under the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) and the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.”In a tweeted response on Thursday, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, derided the EU statement.“The US has bullied Europe – and rest of world – for a year and EU can only express ‘regret’,” Zarif said. “Instead of demanding that Iran unilaterally abide by a multilateral accord, EU should uphold obligations – [including] normalization of economic ties.”The JCPOA is the technical term for the deal signed in 2015 by Iran, Russia, China, the US and three EU states, France, Britain and Germany.The EU said it regretted the reimposition of sanctions by the US after it withdrew from the nuclear deal last year and that the EU remained committed to preserving and fully implementing the deal, including helping the Iranian people enjoy the benefits of sanctions relief.The US laid on further sanctions on Wednesday, mainly focused on the Iranian iron, steel, aluminium and copper industry and apparently designed to push Iranian manufacturing deeper into recession, potentially provoking a rift between blue-collar workers and the government.Iran wanted to bring its nuclear deal with world powers “back on track” after the US’s unilateral withdrawal, Behrouz Kamalvandi, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said.Since pulling out of the deal, Trump has been trying to isolate Iran economically and force Europe to back away from any trading contact, save some humanitarian supplies.The US “maximum pressure campaign” is formally designed to press Iran to renegotiate perceived weaknesses in the deal, but Washington’s critics claim the true aim is to bring the Iranian economy to its knees and provoke a revolution.Tehran is frustrated that Europe says it opposes US actions but seems at best slow in devising a financial mechanism or legal entities that would protect those European companies that wish to trade with Iran.With EU leaders gathering for an informal summit in the Romanian town of Sibiu, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, appealed for calm on all sides, saying Europe must work to convince Iran to stick with the deal. “We must not get jumpy or fall into escalation,” Macron said.",Donald Trump tells Iran ‘call me’ over lifting

"It is unclear what, if anything, Iran can do to induce the United States and its regional allies to halt their escalating war of attrition before it provokes all-out conflict. When Donald Trump reneged on the UN-ratified nuclear agreement with Tehran last year, he said he wanted a better deal. Iran must change its behaviour, he said, and act like a “normal country”.This was always disingenuous. Iran’s authoritarian and abusive rulers certainly need to mend their ways. But what Trump and his imperious advisers really meant was that they must do what America says, in conformity with American interests. What they want is an end to 40 years of post-revolution defiance. What they want is regime change in Iran.Tehran’s leadership now has three choices – capitulate, wait, or resist. Capitulation is no real option at allTehran’s leadership now has three choices – capitulate, wait or resist. Capitulation is no real option at all. Hassan Rouhani, the country’s moderate, conservative president, and senior allies such as the foreign minister, Javad Zarif, would not survive the sort of sweeping strategic and regional pullback required by the Americans.The clerical establishment, led by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rightwing fundamentalists and the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards, would exploit any attempted compromise to vanquish the reformist remnants of the so-called 2009 Persian spring. In short, the mullahs would double down on repression.If, on the other hand, the regime were to lose control in the face, say, of urban uprisings encouraged from abroad, Iran could break apart. This is a land of large ethnic minorities – principally Azeris, Arabs, Baluchis, and Kurds – as well as smaller Baha’i, Turkmen, Christian and Jewish communities. None has particular reason to love the centre.It is unlikely that the Americans have a plan for Iran in the aftermath of a regime collapse, any more than they had a plan for Iraq in 2003. Given that disastrous precedent, John Bolton, Trump’s neocon national security adviser and an architect of the Iraq invasion, should think twice. He and other myopic machinators must be careful what they wish for.Iran’s second option – waiting for Trump to be voted out of office next year – is fraught with difficulty. For a start, he may win a second term. It is also improbable that any Democratic successor would reverse the current policy. He or she might ease the pressure. But in the turgid present-day US political climate, letting Iran off the hook is not on the cards.The idea that the Europeans will ride to the rescue, implicit in Rouhani’s 60-day deadline for a resuscitation of the nuclear deal, is also far-fetched. Neither Britain nor France is happy with Trump’s tactics. But their hostile reaction to Rouhani’s threat to resume some nuclear activities was cautionary. They expect Iran, not the US, to back down.Attempts by some European Union countries over the past year to circumvent renewed American sanctions have come to nothing. The commercial reality is that they cannot protect energy companies, banks and other businesses seeking to trade with Iran from Washington’s punitive secondary sanctions. Hopes that a discredited, divided UN security council will take the US to task for breaking international law are similarly chimerical.Even with Trump out of the picture, Iran would continue to face the visceral enmity of Israel and Saudi Arabia. Without his reactionary soulmate in the White House, it might only be a matter of time before Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, revived past threats to bomb Iran. For the House of Saud, it’s an ancient blood feud.Iran’s last option, resistance, has a dreadful air of inevitability about it. Bolton’s announcement this week of additional, nuclear-armed military deployments in the Gulf, and secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s melodramatic dash to Baghdad in the middle of a European tour, suggested that the White House was just spoiling for a fight.Both men cited secret intelligence about an “imminent” attack by Iran or its proxies on American forces in Syria or Iraq. Perhaps it was accurate. Perhaps not. This vague, untested information reportedly came from Israel, which is skilled at putting the wind up the Americans. Whatever the truth, it had the desired effect.Bolton, who has a long record of manipulating intelligence (he was at it again the other day over Venezuela), used the alleged threat to warn Iran that it would be held responsible for the actions of its proxies, however loose the links, wherever they may be. That means any stray Shia militia group in Iraq, or Houthi rebel in Yemen, now potentially has the power to trigger a direct, armed assault by the US on Iran itself.Pompeo used his theatrical dash to Baghdad to dramatise the seriousness of a crisis he has helped to manufacture. His subsequent meetings in London with Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, became a propaganda platform for condemning Iran as a “lawless” rogue state. Pompeo misleadingly claimed to enjoy the UK’s full support. Hunt did not dare contradict him.The US war of attrition is not merely economic and diplomatic. Iran has faced cyber attacks. Its scientists have been assassinated, its ballistic missile programme sabotaged. It is the target of fake news and disinformation about its past nuclear activities and present-day links to terrorism. It is a country under siege. And US officials say they are just getting started.It is often suggested that Trump wants to avoid another Middle East conflict. But hawks such as Pompeo, Bolton and the vice-president, Mike Pence – who between them are running foreign policy while the president tweets and plays golf – are not so shy. Given past statements about armed intervention, they would probably relish it.The Americans appear implacable. As threats to the regime’s survival escalate and intensify, the prospect of violent retaliation by hardline factions in Tehran, or their minions, grows by the day. Intentionally or not, the US is driving Iran down the path to war.• Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator and former Guardian foreign editor",Trump’s foolish Iran policy only makes war more

to warn iran that it would be held responsible for the actions of its proxies however loose the links wherever they may be that means any stray shia militia group in iraq or houthi rebel in yemen now potentially has the power to trigger a direct armed assault by the us on iran itself pompeo used his theatrical dash to baghdad to dramatise the seriousness of a crisis he has helped to manufacture his subsequent meetings in london with britain s prime minister theresa may and foreign secretary jeremy hunt became a propaganda platform for condemning iran as a lawless rogue state pompeo misleadingly claimed to enjoy the uk s full support hunt did not dare contradict him the us war of attrition is not merely economic and diplomatic iran has faced cyber attacks its scientists have been assassinated its ballistic missile programme sabotaged it is the target of fake news and disinformation about its past nuclear activities and present day links to terrorism it is a country under siege and us officials say they are just getting started it is often suggested that trump wants to avoid another middle east conflict but hawks such as pompeo bolton and the vice president mike pence who between them are running foreign policy while the president tweets and plays golf are not so shy given past statements about armed intervention they would probably relish it the americans appear implacable as threats to the regime s survival escalate and intensify the prospect of violent retaliation by hardline factions in tehran or their minions grows by the day intentionally or not the us

"Donald Trump is doing everything possible to provoke a conflict with Iran while making it look like Iran’s fault.A year ago, Trump withdrew the US from the deal that has successfully stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons – despite the IAEA and even the Trump administration confirming Iran was abiding by the agreement. The day Trump took the US out of the deal, he lit the fuse of a potential crisis.Ever since, Trump has been blowing on the fuse, trying to speed things up. The US imposed sanctions on Iranian banks and shipping companies, attempting to squeeze the Iranian economy. Recently, the Trump administration announced it would no longer grant waivers for the sanctions to some America’s closest partners, including South Korea and Japan.And yet, those who helped build the Iran deal have tried to save it. Europe, China and Russia worked with Iran to maintain the deal, and for a year Iran continued to comply despite America’s withdrawal and pressure. For a period, it seemed as though other countries would keep the deal alive and wait out the Trump administration.Time, however, may now be up. In recent days, the US has significantly ratcheted up what had already been red-hot rhetoric on Iran. In sending a carrier strike group and bomber taskforce to the region, John Bolton, the national security adviser, said: “The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack.”The deployment was supposedly in response to what Bolton described as “a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings”, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, made an urgent trip to Iraq to address the possibility of Iranian attacks. However, one US official described the administration’s response as “overreacting”.It has long been crystal clear that Iran is a malign actor. Iran’s support for terrorism, the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and Hezbollah, and its repression of the Iranian people has caused the US to pressure Iran for decades. There is no need for Trump to hype Iran’s bad behavior – it’s clear as day.But Trump is actually helping Iran make the case for restarting its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Following Trump’s reckless acts, Iran is accusing the US of being the transgressor, claiming that Iran’s “self-restraint has remained unanswered … the Islamic Republic has been left with no choice other than reducing its commitments.“The window which is currently open for diplomacy will not be open for long, and the US and other JCPOA parties will be held fully responsible for the failure of the JCPOA and any possible consequences it may have.”The Trump administration is goading Iran into a conflict, and no one should expect Iran to back downIran now wants countries to choose between Iran and the US, stating that if the other signatories to the deal do not help deflect US sanctions, Iran will increase its nuclear capabilities beyond the limits imposed by the deal.Whether or not countries side with the US or Iran, it is clear the Trump administration is isolating itself. Europeans are frustrated by the administration’s approach, and are creating a system to circumvent US sanctions. Japan, South Korea, China and India – all of whom reduced their oil imports from Iran at the request of the United States in order to make the nuclear deal possible – are fed up with the United States pulling the rug out from underneath them.Most concerning is the potential for a war. Bolton and Pompeo sometimes act like they are itching for a fight, and US actions over the last year have significantly raised the chances for a miscalculation that spirals into conflict. While it might not seem like Trump wants war, he is so inept and ideological on Iran it’s not difficult to see him stumbling into a conflict. And despite Americans’ dissatisfaction with US reliance on the military to solve problems, the fact that 71% of Americans view Iran as an enemy could grease the skids of conflict.The encouragement on Iran that Trump receives from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel isn’t helping. One can easily see a resurgence of Israeli threats of military strikes against Iran – only this time, as former Obama defense department official Colin Kahl puts it: “The US administration is much more likely to encourage Israeli strikes rather than seek to constrain them.”Trump’s actions have now empowered hardliners in Iran, making a diplomatic outcome less likely. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, stuck his neck out to negotiate the nuclear deal, and the US withdrawal has damaged supporters of the deal in Iran. New sanctions have allowed the Iranian regime to more credibly blame the US for the current economic woes. All of this makes Iran more prone to aggression, not capitulation.It is easy to see through the Trump administration’s lies. Trump claims to want to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon but withdrew from the very deal that had stopped Iran from obtaining one. Trump officials claim to be supporting the aspirations of the Iranian people, but the sanctions hurt the Iranian people first and foremost, and Trump is still banning average Iranians from visiting the United States.The Trump administration is goading Iran into a conflict, and no one should expect Iran to back down. Today America is less safe because of Trump’s actions on Iran, and the chances for war are rising.Michael H Fuchs is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and a former deputy assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs",Chances of war with Iran are rising.

"US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has urged the UK to stand with Washington in reining in Iran’s “bloodletting and lawlessness”, as Tehran took the first conditional steps to extricate itself from the landmark nuclear deal it had signed with the west, Russia and China in 2015.Iran said it was acting in response to Donald Trump’s decision a year ago to withdraw the US from the deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, imposing a wave of sanctions not just on Iran but on any company that seeks to trade with it.While Pompeo was in Britain, Trump announced a new layer of sanctions, this time targeting Iranian metal industries.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said Iran’s decision on Wednesday was unwelcome.“They need to be very clear that if they do not comply with the JCPOA, there will be consequences,” he said.“This is a very big moment for Iran. Their economy is a state of severe distress. The last thing they they should be doing is investing money in re-nuclearising. It will make them less secure, not more secure.”But Hunt’s aides said Tehran’s move did not itself represent a breach of the agreement, nor warrant sanctions. Senior British diplomats are due to travel to Tehran this weekend to urge restraint.Pompeo described the announcements made by the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, as “intentionally ambiguous” and designed to make the world jump – and probably aimed at reducing the “breakout time” by which Iran could secure a nuclear bomb.Speaking in London, Pompeo minimised differences between the US and the UK over Iran.“There is no daylight between our two countries on the threat emanating from the Iranian regime,” he said.“We agree they are operating in defiance of UN ballistic missiles resolution. We agree they fund terror across the Middle East and across the world. We agree they take hostages and repress their own people.”But Pompeo added: “I urge the UK to stand with us to rein in bloodletting and lawlessness, not to soothe the ayatollahs angry at our decision to pull out of a nuclear deal.”He implied that if the UK’s true motive in cooperating with Iran was access to new markets, the US and UK could cooperate to find alternatives.Iran’s phased departure from the deal centres on a threat to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels in 60 days’ time if European powers fail to deliver on previous trade promises.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentThe announcement came against a background of military escalation in the Middle East. The US dispatched an aircraft carrier and bombers to the region earlier this week, claiming it had intelligence of a “credible threat” from Iranian forces.The US stepped up its pressure on an already reeling Iranian economy. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday sanctioning the country’s iron, steel, aluminium and copper industries.“We are successfully imposing the most powerful maximum pressure campaign ever witnessed, which today’s action will further strengthen,” Trump said in a written statement.The president held out the prospects of new negotiations, but in the framework of 12 wide-ranging conditions the US has laid down for Iran.“I look forward to someday meeting with the leaders of Iran in order to work out an agreement and, very importantly, taking steps to give Iran the future it deserves,” Trump said.The US has also blocked the sale of Iranian oil on the global market, depriving Tehran of 40 % of its annual revenue. The value of the Iranian rial has collapsed, fuelling unemployment and inflation.Meanwhile, the Rouhani government has come under political pressure from hardliners who have long maintained that Iran gave up too much in the nuclear deal.Rouhani said in a televised address: “We felt that the nuclear deal needs a surgery, and the painkiller pills of the last year have been ineffective. This surgery is for saving the deal, not destroying it.”The first step, Rouhani said, was to end the sale of excess uranium and heavy water, a move that will increase Iran’s stocks of both above levels stipulated in the deal.The move was partially forced on Iran by the US decision last week to end waivers allowing Iran to exchange its enriched uranium for unrefined yellowcake uranium from Russia, and to sell its heavy water – used as a coolant in nuclear reactors – to Oman.If no new deal is in place within 60 days, Iran will increase its enrichment of uranium beyond the 3.67% permitted in the accord, which can fuel a commercial nuclear power plant.Rouhani did not identify the level to which Iran would be willing to enrich, although the head of Iran’s nuclear program again reiterated that it could reach 20% enrichment within four days.Scientists have said that once a country enriches uranium to about 20%, the time needed to reach the 90% threshold for weapons-grade uranium is halved.Rouhani also said that if the 60 days pass without action, Iran will halt a Chinese-led effort to redesign its Arak heavy water nuclear reactor. Such reactors produce plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons.Iran notified Britain, Russia, China, the European Union, France and Germany of its decisions earlier on Wednesday. Iran said it will not need to take the steps if countries “join negotiations and help Iran to reach its benefits in the fields of oil and banking”.It is not clear if Europe has either the means or the will to engineer a mechanism that truly protects European traders dealing with Iranian banks from the threat of US sanctions. Pompeo said it would be legitimate for Europe to trade humanitarian supplies with Iran since they are exempt from sanctions, but they remained the only items exempt from US treasury oversight.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a fierce opponent of Iran and the nuclear deal, said: “I heard that Iran intends to continue its nuclear program. We will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.“We will continue to fight those who seek to take our lives, and we will thrust our roots even deeper into the soil of our homeland.”",Mike Pompeo

"By taking a couple of small, carefully calibrated steps towards the exit from the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran has given Europe and China a two-month ultimatum to stand up to the US on the world stage, or risk a slide towards a new Middle East conflict.The erosion of that multilateral agreement and the return to military posturing in the Persian Gulf, has been driven by a small number of radical players in the Trump administration, the Israeli government, and the Saudi and Emirati monarchies. In the US and Israel, this has happened in the face of resistance from the defence establishment.In the year since Donald Trump abrogated the multilateral agreement with Iran – by which Tehran accepted stringent limits on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief – the European, Russian and Chinese parties to the deal swore to uphold it. But they have failed so far to shield Iran from redoubled US sanctions.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord.

The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law.

Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentCorporations feared being blacklisted in the US more than they feared losing a share in the Iranian market. European efforts to insulate its companies from sanctions have so far proved flimsy.Tehran’s initial response to Trump’s effort to destroy the deal was strategic patience, relying on the rest of the world to keep its economy afloat.Iran hoped that Beijing at least would defy the US and continue to buy its oil when the US ended sanctions exemptions for the last handful of Iran’s remaining customers on 2 May. So far, that has not happened. Now, Beijing is nervous about derailing delicate trade talks with Washington, and Chinese imports have dipped.Russia has voiced support for Iran – but is not an oil customer and carries little weight in the global economy.“For the Europeans, the Chinese and Russians, the nuclear deal has been a priority but it has not been in the top three priorities. It has been the sacrificial lamb,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.By raising the stakes, Iran has challenged Europe and China to wean themselves off dependence on the dollar – for both a long-term aspiration. Iran is now giving them 60 days to take significant strides or face a potentially severe new crisis in the Middle East.The initial two steps announced by President Hassan Rouhani are at the very low end of the scale of available measures. Iran will stop exporting low enriched uranium (LEU) and heavy water – a trade which had kept its stockpiles of both under the levels set by the 2015 deal.For the time being, these steps will have a negligible impact on the central purpose of the agreement: keeping Iran at least a year away from the capability to make a nuclear warhead.The actual LEU stockpile had settled below the agreed 660lb limit and heavy water has no immediate use, as Iran currently has no functioning heavy water reactor or reprocessing plant necessary to make plutonium.The US announced last week that it would begin sanctioning trade in both materials making it harder for the Iran to keep to the agreed limits. By limiting its initial steps to these two measures, Tehran has insured that the blame resides almost entirely in Washington.Much more serious are the steps Iran is threatening to take after the 60-day deadline. Rouhani has it will lift the agreed 3.67% limit on the level of purity to which it enriches uranium. For every percentage point that figure is allowed to creep up, Iran gets exponentially closer to the capacity to produce weapons-grade uranium.Rouhani said that if the ultimatum is not met, Iran will also end a Chinese-led initiative to redesign its heavy water reactor in Arak. If that happened, the route to producing plutonium would be open once more.Such steps, which could bring Iran’s breakout time to below a year, would almost certainly trigger the reimposition of UN and EU sanctions, and an accelerated round of escalation. Iran has even threatened to leave the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), signalling an intention to make nuclear weapons.An NPT withdrawal, or any Iranian move to hinder the oil trade passing through the Strait of Hormuz – another Iranian threat – would bring a military confrontation significantly closer.It is now China and Europe’s move. As a huge oil importer and party to the 2015 deal, Beijing is uniquely placed to demonstrate the agreement’s benefits to the Iranian people.Germany, the UK and France have launched a euro-based payment system, known as Instex, intended to insulate Iranian transactions from US sanctions. It is expected to accommodate non-oil transactions, including food and humanitarian aid, but it has taken a long time to establish and is not yet online.Although accelerating work on Instex would not do much for Iran’s economy in real terms, it would be a sign of political will to defy Trump and uphold the deal.“The Europeans thought they would be appease Trump and ease the ‘maximum pressure’ policy on Iran. Clearly that is not working out,” said Dina Esfandiary, an Iran expert at the Belfer Centre for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University.Meanwhile, China is rethinking its policy, Esfandiary added. “For them it will be a trade-off between highlighting their economic and political sovereignty or safeguarding trade with the US and economic growth.”",Iran challenges Europe and

steps will have a negligible impact on the central purpose of the agreement keeping iran at least a year away from the capability to make a nuclear warhead the actual leu stockpile had settled below the agreed lb limit and heavy water has no immediate use as iran currently has no functioning heavy water reactor or reprocessing plant necessary to make plutonium the us announced last week that it would begin sanctioning trade in both materials making it harder for the iran to keep to the agreed limits by limiting its initial steps to these two measures tehran has insured that the blame resides almost entirely in washington much more serious are the steps iran is threatening to take after the  day deadline rouhani has it will lift the agreed   limit on the level of purity to which it enriches uranium for every percentage point that figure is allowed to creep up iran gets exponentially closer to the capacity to produce weapons grade uranium rouhani said that if the ultimatum is not met iran will also end a chinese led initiative to redesign its heavy water reactor in arak if that happened the route to producing plutonium would be open once more such steps which could bring iran s breakout time to below a year would almost certainly trigger the reimposition of un and eu sanctions and an accelerated round of escalation iran has even threatened to leave the non proliferation

transactions including food and humanitarian aid but it has taken a long time to establish and is not yet online although accelerating work on instex would not do much for iran s economy in real terms

"Iran has suspended commitments it made under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, which lifted sanctions on the country in exchange for limits on Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal was reached after years of negotiations.Hassan Rouhani, president of Iran, said Tehran would hang on to its stocks of excess enriched uranium and heavy water instead of exporting them. He threatened to resume enriching uranium above a limit set out in the deal unless there was progress on sanctions relief.The 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, set out a 3.67% limit for uranium enrichment (enough to fuel a commercial nuclear power plant) and barred Iran from accumulating stocks of more than 300kg of low-enriched uranium and 130 tonnes of heavy water, a coolant used in nuclear reactors.In theory, uranium enriched to much higher levels of purity than Iran’s current stocks could be used as the fissile core of a nuclear weapon, while heavy water is a source of plutonium, which can be used to produce a warhead.Iran is suffering under crippling sanctions restored by the US after Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal last year. The Iranian rial, which traded at 32,000 to $1 at the time of the accord, traded on Wednesday at 153,500.Tehran rightly said the deal had been premised on ending Iran’s economic isolation in exchange for strict and verified limitations on its nuclear activities. By re-imposing sanctions with extraterritorial effects the US has scared companies and banks around the world into reducing, ceasing or not starting business with Iranian counterparts.The US last week also removed waivers on nuclear co-operation with Iran, including the shipment abroad of excess supplies, perversely making it much harder for Iran to keep to the stockpile limits.The economic crisis has increased internal pressure on Rouhani, a relative moderate within Iran’s Shia theocracy, to take some sort of counter action. His policy of waiting for Trump to be succeeded by a nuclear deal-friendly Democrat as US president in 18 months’ time was failing, and he will hope that he is now shielded from criticism from hardliners who have long maintained that Iran gave up too much in the nuclear deal.The Iranians felt they had given the Europeans ample time to come up with a mechanism that would foster trade between the EU and Iran immunised from the threat of American sanctions.Not yet. The Iranians have set out a timetable for a staged withdrawal from the agreement dependent upon the actions of the EU. “This surgery is to save the [deal] not destroy it,” Rouhani said. He has also said the actions are justifiable under articles of the deal which set out the countermeasures party could take if another party was clearly in breach of their obligations.Iran has not done anything to restrict UN inspection of its compliance or to increase research on advanced centrifuges – two steps that might be seen as EU red lines.The White House will be delighted that its maximum pressure campaign has finally made the Iranians crack. The US will use this as a lever to prise the EU away from the agreement, or at least to demand that the EU impose sanctions of its own. Speculation mounts that some Washington figures, such as John Bolton, the national security adviser, is trying to assemble a case for war with Tehran as he did against Iraq in 2002. If there is a single over-riding American foreign policy at present it is hostility to Iran.Europe collectively has heavily invested in diplomacy with Iran and regards the nuclear deal as the high-water mark of multilateralism. Washington’s European allies say Trump’s repudiation of the deal weakens the pragmatic wing of Iran’s leadership and plays into the hands of hardliners. It means the public in Iran see no economic benefits from Rouhani’s efforts to open the country. The EU has long had doubts about Tehran’s missile programme, and activities in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen, but they are viewed separately from the nuclear agreement.It is not evident. Europe has been served notice by Tehran that it must deliver on its commitments to help the Iranian economy, but given the dollar-dominated global economy EU banks and firms are never going to choose

"Iran has announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal signed with world powers in 2015, a year after Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement.President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran will stop exporting enriched uranium stocks as stipulated by the 2015 agreement and warned it would resume higher uranium enrichment in 60 days if the remaining signatories did not make good on promises to shield its oil and banking sectors from sanctions.Wednesday’s measures, announced by Rouhani in an address to the nation, were formally conveyed to ambassadors to countries remaining inside the deal – France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia. The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, separately set out the technical and legal details in a letter to the EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini.Under the deal, Iran is required to sell its surplus enriched uranium abroad, rather than keep it, thereby allowing it to generate nuclear power without building nuclear weapons.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentRouhani said Iran wanted to negotiate new terms with the remaining partners in the deal, but warned that the situation was dire. “We felt that the nuclear deal needs a surgery and the painkiller pills of the last year have been ineffective … This surgery is for saving the deal, not destroying it.”The move is bound to be seized upon by Washington as proof that the nuclear deal – which the US violated in May 2018 – has collapsed and is no longer worth pursuing.EU officials were informed privately of the extent of Iran’s response at a meeting on Tuesday. On Tuesday night, a French source warned that Europe would have no choice but to impose economic sanctions against Iran if it stepped back from the deal. “We don’t want that and we hope that the Iranians will not make this decision,” the source said.Rouhani has been under intense domestic political pressure to produce some kind of counter-measure following the US withdrawal.Tehran has lost patience with Europe’s efforts to create a new viable financial mechanism that would allow European firms to continue trading items such as medicines and humanitarian goods with Iran and circumvent US secondary sanctions.Zarif separately issued his own warning from Moscow, where has been meeting his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. “After a year of patience, Iran stops measures that [the] US has made impossible to continue,” he tweeted. World powers have “a narrowing window to reverse this”.The Trump administration has repeatedly warned European multinationals they will face swingeing US Treasury fines if they trade with Iran and try to operate in the US market. Almost all large European firms have withdrawn from the Iranian market, depressing the economy still further.Under its policy of “maximum pressure”, Washington has extended sweeping sanctions on Tehran and in recent weeks has hit even harder, moving to ban all countries from buying Iran’s oil, its top export, and declaring the Revolutionary Guards to be a terrorist group – the first such designation of a unit of a foreign government.UN inspectors say Iran has remained in compliance with the nuclear deal, which is still backed by European powers as well as Democrats seeking to unseat Trump next year.Iran will claim its announcement falls within sections 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, the deal signed in 2015, which allows Iran to take steps if one party withdraws from the agreement.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is bound to seize on Tehran’s move as a lever with which to prise Europe away from its support for the deal, which was seen as a high-water mark of European diplomacy. Pompeo has been in Iraq this week on an unscheduled visit, where he has been warning about unspecified Iranian activity.European diplomats are left to manage an often contradictory Washington foreign policy, but broadly fear that the US national security adviser, John Bolton, is pursuing a strategy of regime change in Iran that will only backfire, ushering in a more hardline stance.The Kremlin said Iran had been provoked into rolling back some of the terms of the deal due to external pressure, which it blamed on the US. “President [Putin] has repeatedly spoken of the consequences of unthought-out steps regarding Iran and by that I mean the decision taken by Washington [to quit the deal]. Now we are seeing those consequences are starting to happen,” the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterated his country’s long-held position of not allowing Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.“This morning, on my way here, I heard that Iran intends to pursue its nuclear programme,” he said in a speech marking Israel’s Memorial Day. “We will not allow Iran to achieve nuclear weaponry. We will continue to fight those who would kill us.”In Britain, interim Middle East minister Mark Field said the Iranian announcement was unwelcome, but added “we are not at this stage talking of reimposing sanctions”. That would change if Iran clearly abandoned its obligations under the deal, he said, adding that an official would travel to Tehran this week to continue dialogue.",Iran announces partial withdrawal

"The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, cancelled a long-established plan to hold talks with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin on Tuesday, and instead travelled to Iraq to show US support for the Iraqi government during rising tensions with Iran.The unusual last-minute schedule change follows brief talks between Pompeo and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on the sidelines of an Arctic Council meeting in Finland on Monday.Pompeo earlier rang the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, to explain the decision to drop his first meeting in Berlin as secretary of state and promised to reschedule soon.Norbert Röttgen, the chair of the German foreign affairs committee, described the cancellation as “very regrettable”.He said: “There is a lot to discuss about common challenges, but also about the internal relationship between Germany and the US. Even if there were unavoidable reasons for the cancellation, it unfortunately fits into the current climate in the relationship of the two governments.”British and US sources said the Berlin cancellation did not mean talks planned for later on Wednesday between Pompeo, the UK prime minister, Theresa May, and the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, would also be dropped.Pompeo is due to give the Margaret Thatcher lecture in London on the importance of the transatlantic relationship, weeks before Donald Trump’s state visit to Britain, timed to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings.With the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, due in Moscow this week, the US has been concerned by reports that Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, is to announce on Wednesday a partial retreat from the nuclear deal agreed in 2015.The Iranian leadership feels under pressure to respond to a refusal by the US to extend sanctions waivers, especially on Iranian oil, and its imposition of secondary sanctions on any European companies that seek to to trade with Iran. The US has declared the Iranian Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group and announced the dispatching of an aircraft carrier and bomber taskforce to the Middle East, citing unspecified intelligence suggesting Iran may be planning attacks.The US said this week that it is rushing an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East to deter or respond to any Iranian attack. US officials said there were indications Iran was planning to retaliate for the Trump administration’s stepped-up sanctions on the country, although the threat information remains vague.On Tuesday night, a US military spokesman said B-52 bombers would be part of additional forces being sent to the Middle East.In Baghdad, Pompeo met Iraq’s prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi and other top officials to discuss the safety of Americans in Iraq and explain US security concerns amid rising Iranian activity.“We talked to them about the importance of Iraq ensuring that it’s able to adequately protect Americans in their country,” Pompeo told reporters after the meeting.Pompeo said the purpose of the meeting also was to let Iraqi officials know more about “the increased threat stream that we had seen” so they could effectively protect US forces. Other urgent international security issues that may be preoccupying Pompeo include North Korea’s resumption of its missile programme and a possible Russian-endorsed assault on Idlib province in north-east Syria.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, issued a statement of concern about Syria, saying: “The attacks of the regime and its allies, including [on] hospitals, have killed many civilians in recent days.”The lack of an immediate explanation for the Pompeo cancellation came as Russia announced the US secretary of state would be travelling to the Black Sea resort of Sochi next week to hold talks with Lavrov and possibly Vladimir Putin.The discussions will be the first since the Mueller inquiry declared Trump had not been guilty of collusion with Russia during his 2016 election campaign. Both sides may be testing whether the new political environment makes it easier for Washington and Moscow to cooperate.The meeting also follows a phone call between Trump and Putin last week in which the US president downplayed the role of Russia in the Venezuela crisis.

"Iran’s top security body has labeled the sudden US moves to send an aircraft carrier and bombers to the Middle East a form of “psychological warfare”.John Bolton announced Sunday that the United States was deploying the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber taskforce to the Middle East as a message to Iran. The national security adviser did not provide a full explanation of what prompted the initiative.A spokesman for Iran’s supreme national security council dismissed the move, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Tuesday. “Bolton’s statement is a clumsy use of a burnt-out happening, for psychological warfare,” said spokesman Keyvan Khosravi, also with a tinge of mystery to his reference.The deployment was meant to send a message that “unrelenting force” would meet any Iranian attack on the US or its allies, and was in response to “troubling and escalatory” signs of a potential attack on US forces in the region, Bolton said.“The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard or regular Iranian forces,” he said.Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, added on Monday that the US was responding to a “credible threat” from Iran, but gave no details.The aircraft carrier was already in the Mediterranean Sea and was on the way to the Middle East anyway, though officials said its trip would be speeded up. Rotations of US troops and military hardware around the world are routine and usually take place without fanfare.“The deployment seems to be a ‘regularly scheduled’ one by the US navy, and Bolton has just tried to talk it up,” Iran’s state-run Press TV earlier said.Brig Gen Hossein Dehgan, a military adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the United States was “neither willing nor capable” of carrying out an attack on Iran, the semi-official news agency ISNA reported.And Iranian newspapers and commentators have widely dismissed the announcement as a “bluff and “empty rhetoric”.The latest moves come amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran.Donald Trump’s administration announced it was ending waivers that let countries buy oil from Iran despite US sanctions, aiming to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero.

Like a lethal poison, their mutual enmity is seeping through the veins of an already unstable region that has experienced dangerously high levels of volatility in recent days.No clear reason was given by Donald Trump’s national security adviser for his decision to advertise the pre-arranged deployment of military reinforcements to the Middle East. But Bolton singled out Iran, and specifically Iran’s non-state allies and proxy forces, as causes for concern. These groups are deeply involved in several conflict zones including Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Gaza, where fighting with Israeli forces re-erupted last week.“The US is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [IRGC] or regular Iranian forces,” Bolton said.Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state and fellow Iran hawk, repeated the warning, vaguely accusing Iran of “escalatory actions”. “If these actions take place, if they do by some third-party proxy, a militia group, Hezbollah, we will hold the Iranian leadership directly accountable,” he said, implying the US may have received intelligence about supposed plots.This explicit broadening of the range of potential Iran-related US targets is significant. Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a western-designated terrorist group financed by Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, reportedly joined Hamas in firing missiles at Israel from Gaza at the weekend. In a tweet expressing “100% support for Israel”, Trump referred to Islamic Jihad by name.Maybe Bolton and Pompeo were concerned that Iran was using Gaza or planning some other operation to foment violence against Israel and the US at arm’s length, via its proxies, in retaliation for the recent tightening of sanctions and other hostile American measures.Syria could provide another clue. Washington chooses to blame Iran more than Russia for the continuing conflict there. The IRGC has built bases and supports Shia militia forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad’s Moscow-backed regime. According to aid workers, recent days have brought numerous regime airstrikes and barrel bombings of hospitals, causing rising civilian casualties and displacements in north-eastern Hama and Idlib.Whether this is the start of Assad’s long-awaited attempt to reconquer Idlib, the last major rebel-held area, is unclear. But Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, last week refused to rule it out. Any new offensive would probably involve Iranian-led ground forces. Ever reluctant to criticise Putin, Trump views Syrian violence as another reason to go after Iran.Frustration in Washington that its Middle East policies are everywhere failing could be another factor. The Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen against Houthi rebels, who are backed by Tehran, has succeeded only in harming civilians and attracting international opprobrium. Congressional Democrats have accused Trump of aiding and abetting Saudi war crimes and want to stop arms sales.In Iraq, the remaining US troop presence is increasingly controversial. Ruling Shia politicians with close links to Tehran, representing majority opinion, have made clear they do not want the country used as an American base against Iran. And despite Washington’s attempts to isolate and sanction it, Lebanon’s heavily armed Hezbollah – Iran’s loyal ally – remains formidable.Nor can Trump and his advisers rely on traditional allies in efforts to force regime change in Iran. European countries, including Britain, continue to uphold the UN-approved 2015 nuclear pact with Tehran, which the US reneged on last year, while the UN’s nuclear watchdog insists Iran is in compliance.Trump’s “maximum pressure” has poisoned wells elsewhere, too. China, Turkey and India are expected to ignore US demands to cease buying Iranian oil, despite a 1 May deadline set by Washington. China told the US last month not to interfere in its legitimate and lawful “cooperation” with Iran. In other words, butt out.

"Militants in Gaza and Israeli forces engaged in a bloody and spiralling clash over the weekend, with Palestinian factions launching hundreds of rockets towards towns and cities in Israel, which retaliated with more than 250 strikes.In exchanges that marked some of the worst fighting in recent years, 19 Palestinians, including two pregnant women and a toddler, have been killed since hostilities began on Friday, the health ministry in Gaza said. The dead included at least eight militants and a Hamas commander killed in the first targeted assassination Israel has conducted in the strip for years.Four Israelis were reported as killed by rockets, the highest death toll on the Israeli side since the 50-day war in 2014.On Sunday night, Donald Trump tweeted his “100%” support for Israel’s actions after “a barrage of deadly rocket attacks by terrorist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad”.He added: “To the Gazan people — these terrorist acts against Israel will bring you nothing but more misery. End the violence and work towards peace – it can happen!”The violence is following a pattern established over the past year in which short-lived exchanges have erupted on a near-monthly basis, usually dying down quickly under Egyptian and UN mediation. Late on Sunday a TV station belonging to Hamas claimed a ceasefire had been reached, however, the battling sides vowed to pursue each other aggressively on Sunday and moved further than in previous flare-ups.Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the armed forces to conduct “massive strikes” on Gaza and reinforce the edge of the enclave with tanks, artillery and soldiers.“This morning, I instructed the [military] to continue massive attacks against terrorist elements in the Gaza strip. I also ordered the reinforcement of the units around the Gaza strip with armour, artillery and infantry,” the prime minister said.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF), which had halted its targeted assassination to avoid escalating tensions, said it killed Hamas commander Ahmed Khudari in an operation, believed to be a strike on a car. The army said Khudari was responsible for cash transfers from Iran to militants in Gaza.The IDF said it had also targeted Palestinian militants inside a weapons warehouse. In another attack, an IDF attack helicopter shot at a militant, and the army said it was bombing “weapons warehouses hidden in houses of terror operatives”.In previous rounds the Israeli air force has sought to avoid high casualties, even among militants, often telling residents of Gaza by phone that they are going to bomb a building so it can be emptied.Hamas, which rules the strip, and a separate armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, continued to fire off rockets late into Sunday evening. Israel said more than 600 had been launched in total and the militant factions put out a statement threatening to use longer-range rockets to bombard deeper into Israel. “The resistance decided to respond to the crimes of the occupation in an unprecedented manner,” it said.Israel’s anti-missile Iron Dome system had intercepted many of the projectiles but several landed in residential neighbourhoods. In one strike, a primary school was hit and a hospital was damaged by shards of debris from an intercepted rocket. Several Israelis, including an 80-year-old woman, were wounded.In Gaza, the dead included a pregnant woman and her 14-month-old niece. Israel denied responsibility for their deaths, saying they were hit by accidental militant fire. The health ministry in Gaza said on Sunday evening a second woman, who was nine months pregnant, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. The IDF said it would not comment.Israel’s bombing campaign also flattened a building containing the Gaza office of the Turkish state-run news agency, an attack the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said was an act of “terrorism”. The IDF said it had hit a building in Gaza City containing Hamas military intelligence and general security offices.Fatima Al-Zaeem, a 45-year-old from Gaza City, said she and her four children had been hiding from the strikes all weekend. “We are not heroes, we are the victims of aggression and siege,” she said. “It’s a situation of horror for two days now. I’m a mother of four kids and we are on the eve of Ramadan.”Fighting is often sparked by an incident that ignites tensions. On Friday, Palestinian militants fired across the border, wounding two soldiers, which Israel responded to with airstrikes, killing two Hamas militants. Israeli snipers also killed two people in Gaza demonstrating near the frontier.UN peace envoy Nickolay Mladenov has since called for calm.“Continuing down the current path of escalation will quickly undo what has been achieved and destroy the chances for long-term solutions to the crisis,” he said in a statement. “This endless cycle of violence must end, and efforts must accelerate to realise a political solution to the crisis in Gaza.”Jeremy Stoner, Middle East regional director for the aid agency Save the Children, said the humanitarian community “believes we may have entered the most serious stage in this crisis since the 2014 Gaza war.“We echo the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process’s call on all parties to immediately de-escalate the situation,” he added.An Egyptian-led ceasefire agreement was designed to ease the conditions of a 12-year air, land and sea blockade on Gaza while halting rocket fire into Israel. Following the rocket strikes, Israel closed entry and exits to Gaza and restricted its fishing zone.The escalation comes as Israel prepares to host the high-profile Eurovision song contest in Tel Aviv. The week of the competition will also mark the one-year anniversary since Israeli snipers killed nearly 60 Palestinians protesting at the frontier.The 140 sq mile strip is home to about 2 million people but has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt since Hamas took control in 2007. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars and the economy has imploded, with youth unemployment over 70%. Hamas’s rival, the Palestinian Authority, based in the occupied West Bank, has also imposed sanctions on the strip, cutting off money transfers and deepening the crisis.",More than 20 dead as violence

"The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, has said Tehran will continue to defy US sanctions by finding buyers for its oil and warned that Washington should “be prepared for the consequences” if it tries to stop it.The US announced the sanctions in November but some countries got temporary waivers that allowed them to import Iranian oil. Washington now says those waivers, which mainly affect China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey, will expire on 2 May.Zarif, seen as the moderate face of Iran and speaking in New York, said Tehran would also keep the Strait of Hormuz open for oil exports.“We believe that Iran will continue to sell its oil. We will continue to find buyers for our oil and we will continue to use the Strait of Hormuz as a safe transit passage for the sale of our oil.“It is in our interest, our vital national security interest, to keep the Persian Gulf open, to keep the Strait of Hormuz open.”He added that if the US entered the Strait, they had to “talk to those who are protecting the Strait of Hormuz, and that is (the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps)“. The IRGC has been designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration.Zarif also insisted there was no need for Iran to reopen the 2015 nuclear deal with the west as demanded by Trump. “The US left the table. The table is still there. It’s not as if there’s no table. I negotiated all of that agreement and I know that neither Iran nor the United States will ever get a better agreement,” he said.His remarks suggest Tehran appears to have decided the best course is to ride out Trump’s sanctions in the hope that the presidential elections in 2020 will bring a Democrat to office willing to revert to the 2015 deal. Most Democratic presidential candidates have said they will honour the Obama deal again, giving Tehran an incentive to keep its economy afloat by any means until then.Zarif also lashed out at Trump for failing to condemn the mass execution by Saudi Arabia of 38 people in one day.He said in reference to the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi: “After a wink at the dismembering of a journalist, not a whisper from the Trump administration when Saudi Arabia beheads 37 men in one day – even crucifying one two days after Easter.”Saudi Arabia is co-operating with the US to increase oil production if the removal of 1m barrels of Iranian oil from the market prompts a shortage, Brian Hook, the US special representative for Iran said this week. Trump could ill-afford a petrol price rise in the run-up to the presidential elections brought about by his sanctions on Iran.Commenting on the end of the oil waivers , Ali Vaez, Iran project director at Crisis Group, said “The intent is clear: bankrupt Iran into acceding to unilateral US demands or, even better, imploding its regime. But the campaign against Iran is more likely to fuel resistance and retaliation than capitulation.”“Washington should heed past lessons lest it provokes a new nuclear crisis or a regional escalation.”","Iran will continue to defy US oil sanctions, says Tehran",2019-04-24/16:53:16,the iranian foreign minister javad zarif has said tehran will continue to defy us sanctions by finding buyers for its oil and warned that washington should be prepared for the consequences if it tries to stop it the us announced the sanctions in november but some countries got temporary waivers that allowed them to import iranian oil washington now says those waivers which mainly affect china india japan south korea and turkey will expire on  may zarif seen as the moderate face of iran and speaking in new york said tehran would also keep the strait of hormuz open for oil exports we believe that iran will continue to sell its oil we will continue to find buyers for our oil and we will continue to use the strait of hormuz as a safe transit passage for the sale of our oil it is in our interest our vital national security interest to keep the persian gulf open to keep the strait of hormuz open he added that if the us entered the strait they had to talk to those who are protecting the strait of hormuz and that is the islamic revolutionary guard corps the irgc has been designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the trump administration zarif also insisted there was no need for iran to reopen the  nuclear deal with the west as demanded by trump the us left the table the table is still there it s not as if there s no table i negotiated all of that agreement and i know that neither iran nor the united states will ever get a better agreement he said his remarks suggest tehran appears to have decided the best course is to ride out trump s sanctions in the hope that the presidential elections in  will bring a democrat to office willing to revert to the  deal most democratic presidential candidates have said they will honour the obama deal again giving tehran an incentive to keep its economy afloat by any means until then zarif also lashed out at trump for failing to condemn the mass execution by saudi arabia of  people in one day he said in reference to the murder of the saudi journalist jamal khashoggi after a wink at the dismembering of a journalist not a whisper from the trump administration when saudi arabia beheads  men in one day even crucifying one two days after easter saudi arabia is co operating with the us to increase oil production if the removal of m barrels of iranian oil from the market prompts a shortage brian hook the us special representative for iran said this week trump could ill afford a petrol price rise in the run up to the presidential elections brought about by his sanctions on iran commenting on the end of the oil waivers ali vaez iran project director at crisis group said the intent is clear bankrupt iran into acceding to unilateral us demands or even better imploding its regime but the campaign against iran is more likely to fuel resistance and retaliation than capitulation washington should heed past lessons lest it provokes a new nuclear crisis or a regional escalation ,Iran Sanctions,0.211142853
"The US has announced it will no longer exempt countries from sanctions that aim to impose a complete oil embargo on Iran.Officials said the Trump administration would not renew any of the sanctions waivers granted to a handful of countries, including China, India, Turkey, Japan and South Korea, when those waivers expire on 2 May.“Today I am announcing that we will no longer grant any exemptions,” Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, said. “We’re going to zero. We will continue to enforce sanctions and monitor compliance. Any nation or entity interacting with Iran should do its diligence and err on the side of caution. The risks are simply not going to be worth the benefits.”Neither Pompeo nor senior state department officials would say whether sanctions would be immediately imposed on the affected countries on 3 May, if oil purchases continued.Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal with Iran, the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), in May 2018 and threatened US sanctions against any international companies that continued to do business with Iran.Trump administration officials said the waivers, originally granted to eight countries, were motivated by a desire to avoid a spike in oil prices in a tight market last year. They said the waivers were being allowed to end because there was now greater supply. However, oil prices jumped to a six-month high on Monday.“When Trump withdrew from the Iran deal, it sent the US on a course of self-isolation and dwindling options,” Suzanne DiMaggio, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said. “A year later, with no progress to show, he is doubling down.”Pompeo said the aim of the sanctions was to convince Iran to act like “a normal country”. Last year, he laid down 12 conditions Tehran would have to fulfil for the sanctions to be lifted, including an end to all uranium enrichment, cutting support to Hizbullah, Hamas , Islamic Jihad, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and withdrawing from Syria.The administration’s critics say the real motive of the sanctions is to try to goad Iran into leaving the JCPOA, which imposed strict curbs on its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief, and therefore end US isolation on the issue. The EU and most US allies continue to support the JCPOA.“This is clearly one of the administration’s goals,” DiMaggio said. “But the Iranians are savvy enough to know this and at this stage of the game they are not going to be goaded into doing something that is not in their interests.”It is unclear whether the US will be able to persuade Iran’s remaining customers to stop buying its oil. Industry analysts have said they expect India to comply after the country’s general elections. The Chinese and Turkish governments have both expressed irritation at being told whose oil they are allowed to buy. Both countries are involved in complex disputes with the US, in which Iranian oil could be a bargaining counter.“China has the capacity to ignore the sanctions if it wants to,” Jarrett Blanc, the former state department coordinator for JCPOA implementation, said. “If they want to continue to buy Iranian oil it has ways to structure the transaction in a way it doesn’t matter if the US sanctions it.”","US toughens stance on Iran, ending exemptions from oil sanctions",2019-04-23/01:13:09,the us has announced it will no longer exempt countries from sanctions that aim to impose a complete oil embargo on iran officials said the trump administration would not renew any of the sanctions waivers granted to a handful of countries including china india turkey japan and south korea when those waivers expire on  may today i am announcing that we will no longer grant any exemptions mike pompeo the secretary of state said we re going to zero we will continue to enforce sanctions and monitor compliance any nation or entity interacting with iran should do its diligence and err on the side of caution the risks are simply not going to be worth the benefits neither pompeo nor senior state department officials would say whether sanctions would be immediately imposed on the affected countries on  may if oil purchases continued donald trump withdrew from the  multilateral nuclear deal with iran the joint comprehensive programme of action jcpoa in may  and threatened us sanctions against any international companies that continued to do business with iran trump administration officials said the waivers originally granted to eight countries were motivated by a desire to avoid a spike in oil prices in a tight market last year they said the waivers were being allowed to end because there was now greater supply however oil prices jumped to a six month high on monday when trump withdrew from the iran deal it sent the us on a course of self isolation and dwindling options suzanne dimaggio senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace said a year later with no progress to show he is doubling down pompeo said the aim of the sanctions was to convince iran to act like a normal country last year he laid down  conditions tehran would have to fulfil for the sanctions to be lifted including an end to all uranium enrichment cutting support to hizbullah hamas islamic jihad and the houthi rebels in yemen and withdrawing from syria the administration s critics say the real motive of the sanctions is to try to goad iran into leaving the jcpoa which imposed strict curbs on its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief and therefore end us isolation on the issue the eu and most us allies continue to support the jcpoa this is clearly one of the administration s goals dimaggio said but the iranians are savvy enough to know this and at this stage of the game they are not going to be goaded into doing something that is not in their interests it is unclear whether the us will be able to persuade iran s remaining customers to stop buying its oil industry analysts have said they expect india to comply after the country s general elections the chinese and turkish governments have both expressed irritation at being told whose oil they are allowed to buy both countries are involved in complex disputes with the us in which iranian oil could be a bargaining counter china has the capacity to ignore the sanctions if it wants to jarrett blanc the former state department coordinator for jcpoa implementation said if they want to continue to buy iranian oil it has ways to structure the transaction in a way it doesn t matter if the us sanctions it ,Iran Sanctions,0.280958146
"His supporters call him a magician. And there is truly something uncanny about how Benjamin Netanyahu has conjured up three-way US, Russian and Arab support for his hardline security and nationalist agenda. For a small country, Israel packs an ever bigger punch – and pugnacious Bibi’s likely fifth term presages a new era of escalating confrontation.First in line for the Netanyahu treatment is Iran. He claimed credit on Monday for Donald Trump’s unprecedented decision to brand Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, including its al-Quds force, a foreign terrorist organisation. The provocative move, akin to singling out the US marine corps for punishment, bought a vengeful riposte from Tehran.Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, declared all US forces would henceforth likewise be regarded as “terrorist groups”. The foreign minister, Javad Zarif, termed the move “another dangerous US misadventure” – implying a heightened risk of future clashes with US troops – for example, in Iraq – or Israeli forces over Syria.Iran, smarting from the virtual wrecking of its 2015 nuclear deal and the resumption of US sanctions, will also see Netanyahu’s hand in renewed US efforts to undermine Hezbollah, Tehran’s close partner in Lebanon, with threats to ostracise its local allies.Trump and Netanyahu regard Hezbollah as solely a terrorist outfit. In fact, it is Lebanon’s most powerful political organisation, controlling three government ministries. It is also armed to the teeth. US-Israeli attempts to undercut Hezbollah could destabilise Lebanon as a whole – and hasten renewed conflict on Israel’s northern border.Despite the close poll result, Netanyahu, egged on by a bevy of hard-right coalition parties, may interpret it as an endorsement of his rejection of an independent Palestinian state and his vow to extend sovereignty over the West Bank. That could spell big trouble ahead with Hamas in Gaza, where relations are on a knife edge, but also in the Occupied Territories, where relative calm has reigned of late.Iran, Lebanon, and now Palestine – intensifying problems potentially loom on all three fronts. As before, Netanyahu is likely to turn to Trump for backing. Having gained US support for his claims to Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, he will hope for a White House green light for any annexations, too.Now the elections are over, Jared Kushner, Trump’s amateur envoy, is due to unveil his long-awaited “peace plan”. Legitimising post-1967 Israeli territorial seizures and the overriding of old borders is reportedly part of his proposed deal, in return for economic investment worth $25bn in the West Bank and Gaza and another $40bn in Egypt and Jordan.Many Palestinians have already rejected Kushner’s efforts as chronically unbalanced. The US, it is claimed, is trying to buy off the Palestinians with cash that, for the most part, would come from wealthy Arab countries that share Trump’s wider anti-Iran, anti-Europe, anti-UN agenda. So fierce resistance can be expected.Yet Netanyahu’s apparent confidence that he will get his way on Iran and Palestine stems not only from his close relationship with Trump, but also with Vladimir Putin. He has met Russia’s president 13 times in the past four years. Although there are differences of approach regarding Tehran, Netanyahu and Putin are two of a kind who have forged a working arrangement – for example, on Syria – that suits both.More than that, they share with Trump a harsh, rightwing nationalist-populist agenda, fierce antipathy to Obama-era, European-style multilateralism and multiculturalism, a penchant for divisions, walls and barriers, and a self-serving belief in “strongman” leadership. Among Arab states, they have found enthusiastic emulators in Egypt and Saudi Arabia – and similarly in Turkey.Netanyahu, Trump and Putin are deceptive, polarising figures with a knack for acting with impunity, said the al-Jazeera analyst Marwan Bishara, who dubbed them “three old white men with a mean streak”.

"Politicians in Iran wore uniforms of the Revolutionary Guards in parliament on Tuesday in protest at the US decision to classify the nation’s military wing as a foreign terrorist organisation.There were chants of “Death to America” as the president, Hassan Rouhani, declared the force was “dearer than ever in the hearts of the Iranian nation” and announced countermeasures against the US.Donald Trump’s move on Monday marked the first time Washington has declared another nation’s military wing a terrorist organisation – in the same category as non-state groups such as Isis or al-Qaida.Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, met members of the Revolutionary Guards on Tuesday, telling them: “Americans imagine they are designing and making trouble against the guard – in fact against the revolution and Iran – but their evil designs will not harm [the force]”.Rouhani announced that US Central Command (Centcom), the Pentagon wing dealing with US operations in most of the Middle East and Iran, would be classified as a terrorist organisation and the US government as a sponsor of terror.“Who are you to label revolutionary institutions as terrorists?” Rouhani asked in a televised speech. “You are the leader of world terrorism. This mistake will unite Iranians and the guards will grow more popular in Iran and in the region.”Relations between Tehran and Washington frayed when Trump entered the White House two years ago and took a decisive turn for the worse last May when the president pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and reimposed sanctions.The US had already blacklisted dozens of entities and people for affiliations with the Revolutionary Guards, but not the organisation as a whole.Comprising an estimated 125,000-strong military with army, navy and air units, the Revolutionary Guards answer only to Iran’s supreme leader. They command the Basij, a religious volunteer paramilitary force, and control Iran’s missile programmes. Their overseas Quds forces have fought Iran’s proxy wars in the region, most notably in Syria.On Monday the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said the new designation was intended to isolate Iran and would allow the US to impose further sanctions, diverting financial resources used to fund terrorism and militant activity in the Middle East and beyond.“This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognises the reality that Iran is not only a state sponsor of terrorism but that the IRGC [the Guards] actively participates in, finances and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,” a statement said.The move has been welcomed by authorities in Saudi Arabia, Iran’s regional rival and a firm friend of the White House, where officials described it as a “serious and practical step to combat terrorism”.However, the decision is likely to complicate US activities in countries such as Iraq and Lebanon, whose governments are US partners but where Shia political parties and militias have strong links to Iran.",Iran's MPs don uniform of Revolutionary Guards in protest at US,2019-04-09/17:48:58,politicians in iran wore uniforms of the revolutionary guards in parliament on tuesday in protest at the us decision to classify the nation s military wing as a foreign terrorist organisation there were chants of death to america as the president hassan rouhani declared the force was dearer than ever in the hearts of the iranian nation and announced countermeasures against the us donald trump s move on monday marked the first time washington has declared another nation s military wing a terrorist organisation in the same category as non state groups such as isis or al qaida iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who has the final say on all state matters met members of the revolutionary guards on tuesday telling them americans imagine they are designing and making trouble against the guard in fact against the revolution and iran but their evil designs will not harm the force rouhani announced that us central command centcom the pentagon wing dealing with us operations in most of the middle east and iran would be classified as a terrorist organisation and the us government as a sponsor of terror who are you to label revolutionary institutions as terrorists rouhani asked in a televised speech you are the leader of world terrorism this mistake will unite iranians and the guards will grow more popular in iran and in the region relations between tehran and washington frayed when trump entered the white house two years ago and took a decisive turn for the worse last may when the president pulled out of a  nuclear deal between iran and six world powers and reimposed sanctions the us had already blacklisted dozens of entities and people for affiliations with the revolutionary guards but not the organisation as a whole comprising an estimated   strong military with army navy and air units the revolutionary guards answer only to iran s supreme leader they command the basij a religious volunteer paramilitary force and control iran s missile programmes their overseas quds forces have fought iran s proxy wars in the region most notably in syria on monday the us secretary of state mike pompeo said the new designation was intended to isolate iran and would allow the us to impose further sanctions diverting financial resources used to fund terrorism and militant activity in the middle east and beyond this unprecedented step led by the department of state recognises the reality that iran is not only a state sponsor of terrorism but that the irgc the guards actively participates in finances and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft a statement said the move has been welcomed by authorities in saudi arabia iran s regional rival and a firm friend of the white house where officials described it as a serious and practical step to combat terrorism however the decision is likely to complicate us activities in countries such as iraq and lebanon whose governments are us partners but where shia political parties and militias have strong links to iran ,Iran Sanctions,0.391812146
"The United States has designated Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards as a foreign terrorist organization, Donald Trump said on Monday, marking the first time Washington has formally named a branch of the armed forces of a foreign government as a terrorist group.In a statement, Trump said this unprecedented step, “recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a state sponsor of terrorism, but that the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft”.Iran responded soon after, designating the US a “state sponsor of terrorism” and its military forces in the region “terror groups”.In a statement, the Supreme National Security Council declared “that it considers the regime of the USA a ‘state sponsor of terrorism’ and ‘the Central Command of America, known as Centcom’ and all forces related to it ‘terrorist groups’”, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (Irna), a state-run news agency.The council added: “The IRGC unlike America and its regional allies who have always supported extremist and terrorist groups in West Asia region, have always been in the frontline of fighting terrorism and extremism in the region.”Critics have warned that the move could raise the risk of retaliation against US military and intelligence officials. The United States has already blacklisted dozens of entities and people for affiliations with the IRGC, but not the organization as a whole.The move against Iran’s most powerful security organization comes nearly a year after Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimposed the sanctions that had crippled the nation’s economy.On Twitter, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Zarif called the move “A(nother) misguided election-eve gift” to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing a tough re-election campaign.Netanyahu, who has repeatedly turned to the Trump administration for help, thanked him on Twitter: “Once again you are keeping the world safe from Iran aggression and terrorism.”Iran’s state-run TV said the move contradicted international law. “No other country has the legal right to designate as terrorist another country’s armed forces ... Iran’s influence in the Middle East and its success in fighting against Islamic State are reasons behind this designation,” the broadcaster said.The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, a strident critic of Iran, has pushed for the change in US policy as part of the Trump administration’s tough posture toward Tehran. Pompeo told told reporters at a news conference on Monday that the designation will take effect in one week.Pompeo, and the national security adviser, John Bolton, have both pushed the administration to adopt an even harder line against Iran.In a tweet on Monday, Bolton said the move “demonstrates our commitment to maximize pressure on the Iranian regime until it ceases using terrorism as tool of statecraft”.Experts have said it was unclear how much concrete difference the terrorist designation would make. It is already heavily sanctioned by the US as a terrorist supporter, and Iran is designated a state sponsor of terrorism.Yet the move is likely to increase the trepidation on the part of foreign companies when it comes to trading with or investing in Iran.After the designation takes effect, the US attorney general, William Barr, said “any person will be prohibited from knowingly providing material support or resources” to the IRGC.“The IRGC’s active support for terrorism is unacceptable, and the Department of Justice continues to support the administration’s efforts to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its actions,” Barr said in a statement.It will also complicate diplomacy. Without exclusions or waivers to the designation, US troops and diplomats could be barred from contact with Iraqi or Lebanese authorities who interact with Guard officials or surrogates.“This action will significantly expand the scope and scale of our maximum pressure on the Iranian regime. It makes crystal clear the risks of conducting business with, or providing support to, the IRGC. If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism,” Trump said.The IRGC controls a large slice of the Iranian economy (the Trump administration claims up to half), and the US treasury and state department have stressed that the onus is on foreign companies to find out if the partners they deal with in Iran are tied to sanctioned groups.Iran’s close ally Syria condemned the move as a “blatant attack” on the country’s sovereignty.The Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a prominent Iran hawk, praised the move.“The IRGC has been wreaking havoc throughout the Middle East and is a direct arm of the Ayatollah’s hateful policies,” he said, adding: “This announcement is another example of their commitment to reining in the destructive and murderous Iranian regime.”",Trump

"The likelihood that Benjamin Netanyahu will emerge victorious after Israel’s election on Tuesday is doubtless pleasing for his rightwing supporters and his oleaginous pal in the White House. But it is a worrying prospect for the country and the Middle East as a whole. Mr Netanyahu has dominated domestic politics for a decade, yet has failed in the most important task of any Israeli leader: making the country safe.The polls point to a Netanyahu-led coalition comprising his party, Likud and several rightwing and far-right minor parties. It remains possible, though less likely, that the centrist Blue and White alliance led by the former army chief, Benjamin Gantz, will prevail. Either way, winning margins will be tight, raising doubts about the stability and longevity of the next government.Assuming he retains office, Mr Netanyahu may be quickly undermined by criminal proceedings. Israel’s attorney general has said he plans to indict him after the vote on three separate charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, which could result in jail sentences. Mr Netanyahu, who denies the allegations, could try to claim immunity from prosecution while he remains prime minister, though Likud colleagues say they would oppose such a move.Whoever emerges as Israel’s next leader is sure to face daunting challenges that, to a large degree, are the product of 10 years of missed opportunities. Mr Netanyahu’s lack of strategic vision, coupled with his polarising and divisive style, has left the country vulnerable to a range of potential threats that many Israelis do not appear to appreciate fully .The most dangerous is Iran. His success in derailing Tehran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with the US and EU has increased, not decreased, the risk to Israel. Donald Trump’s decision to tear up the pact and reimpose sanctions on Iran was decisively influenced by Mr Netanyahu and, to a lesser extent, the Saudis. Now, predictably, pressure is building inside Iran to engage in the very sort of nuclear activities the pact was designed to guard against. The virtual collapse of the deal, and Mr Netanyahu’s persistently bellicose rhetoric, is reviving the spectre of future, pre-emptive Israeli airstrikes against presumed Iranian nuclear facilities. Knowing this, Iran has responded by exploiting its Syrian alliance to establish permanent military bases on Israel’s northern border, which it claims are defensive and which Israel’s air force frequently attacks. Far from warding off a conflagration, his policy has made one more likely.Mr Netanyahu’s disdain for Israel’s traditional European allies, echoing his fractious relationship with Barack Obama, and his preference for “strongman” rightwingers cast in his own image, has produced some unedifying liaisons. Hungary’s populist-nationalist leader, Viktor Orbán, cannot be counted a reliable partner. Neither can Russia’s Vladimir Putin, with whom Mr Netanyahu has grown close, nor, for that matter, Sunni Muslim autocrats in Riyadh who detest Iranians marginally more than Jews.In encouraging and facilitating Mr Netanyahu’s obstructive, do-nothing attitude to a Palestinian settlement, President Trump, the ultimate rightwing populist, does Israel no favours. Mr Netanyahu counts illegal US recognition of Israel’s claims to Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as signal triumphs. But President Trump is a false friend offering disastrous counsel. All that these ill-advised gestures will ultimately achieve is a deepening of long-term risks to Israel’s security.Mr Netanyahu’s stubborn refusal to seek an equitable peace with the Palestinians, based on the two-state solution he once endorsed, forms a backdrop to almost daily confrontations in Gaza and Hamas’s murderous and deplorable rocket attacks on Israeli civilians. It helps radicalise the intimidated, dispossessed and disenfranchised Arabs of the Occupied Territories, where hope is usurped by anger.Mr Netanyahu’s strategic blindness has failed to check war-hardened Hezbollah’s missile build-up in southern Lebanon, now estimated at 130,000 rockets, all aimed at Israeli cities. More dangerous still, his bullish intransigence and ill-disguised racism have damaged Israel’s international standing. Netanyahu has had his chance.

"The Trump administration is reportedly planning to designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, in an unprecedented step aimed at escalating Washington’s campaign of “maximum pressure”.According to the Wall Street Journal, the administration is preparing to announce the move as early as Monday. It would mark the first time the US has designated a branch of the armed forces of a foreign government as a terrorist group.The US state department declined to comment on the report on Friday evening.Experts said it was unclear how much concrete difference the terrorist designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would make. It is already heavily sanctioned by the US as a terrorist supporter, and Iran is designated a state sponsor of terrorism.“It is hard to imagine a bigger sanctions stick than that,” said Richard Nephew, a former principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the state department, and the author of The Art of Sanctions.“Frankly, I still don’t believe that this is consistent with the intent of the underlying law, which was to target non-state actors.”The move, if carried out, is likely to increase the trepidation on the part of foreign companies when it comes to trading with or investing in Iran.The IRGC controls a large slice of the Iranian economy (the Trump administration claims up to half), and the US treasury and state department have stressed that the onus is on foreign companies to find out if the partners they deal with in Iran are tied to sanctioned groups.“This is uncharted territory. We haven’t done this before,” said Ariane Tabatabai, an Iran expert at the Rand Corporation.“It is a sign the US is prepared to fully escalate ‘maximum pressure’ but what is lacking is a clear endgame. There is a confusion of means and ends. The administration sees the damage inflicted as success. But that’s not how it works.“The IRGC has always thrived under pressure,” Tabatabai, the coauthor of a book on Iranian foreign policy, Triple Axis: Iran’s Relations with Russia and China, added.The Wall Street Journal report said that senior Pentagon officials were apprehensive about the move, fearing it could provoke a backlash against US troops in the region.Mohammad Ali Shabani, an Iran scholar at Soas University of London, said that if the designation is announced, the Iranian government is likely to respond in kind.“First and foremost, the Iranian parliament may move to label the US military a terrorist organization,” Shabani said, but he added he thought the Iranian military would avoid being drawn into a direct clash with US forces in the region.He argued that it marked an attempt by Iran hawks in the administration, like the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the national security adviser, John Bolton, to box in future decision making on Iran.“The point of all of this is to constrain Trump’s deal-making instinct as much as possible and make it as difficult as possible for the next US president to return to sanity on Iran.”",Trump administration to designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guards a terror group – report,2019-04-06/00:53:04,the trump administration is reportedly planning to designate iran s revolutionary guards as a terrorist organisation in an unprecedented step aimed at escalating washington s campaign of maximum pressure according to the wall street journal the administration is preparing to announce the move as early as monday it would mark the first time the us has designated a branch of the armed forces of a foreign government as a terrorist group the us state department declined to comment on the report on friday evening experts said it was unclear how much concrete difference the terrorist designation of the islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc would make it is already heavily sanctioned by the us as a terrorist supporter and iran is designated a state sponsor of terrorism it is hard to imagine a bigger sanctions stick than that said richard nephew a former principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the state department and the author of the art of sanctions frankly i still don t believe that this is consistent with the intent of the underlying law which was to target non state actors the move if carried out is likely to increase the trepidation on the part of foreign companies when it comes to trading with or investing in iran the irgc controls a large slice of the iranian economy the trump administration claims up to half and the us treasury and state department have stressed that the onus is on foreign companies to find out if the partners they deal with in iran are tied to sanctioned groups this is uncharted territory we haven t done this before said ariane tabatabai an iran expert at the rand corporation it is a sign the us is prepared to fully escalate maximum pressure but what is lacking is a clear endgame there is a confusion of means and ends the administration sees the damage inflicted as success but that s not how it works the irgc has always thrived under pressure tabatabai the coauthor of a book on iranian foreign policy triple axis iran s relations with russia and china added the wall street journal report said that senior pentagon officials were apprehensive about the move fearing it could provoke a backlash against us troops in the region mohammad ali shabani an iran scholar at soas university of london said that if the designation is announced the iranian government is likely to respond in kind first and foremost the iranian parliament may move to label the us military a terrorist organization shabani said but he added he thought the iranian military would avoid being drawn into a direct clash with us forces in the region he argued that it marked an attempt by iran hawks in the administration like the secretary of state mike pompeo and the national security adviser john bolton to box in future decision making on iran the point of all of this is to constrain trump s deal making instinct as much as possible and make it as difficult as possible for the next us president to return to sanity on iran ,Iran Sanctions,0.320132256
"Russia has sent in aircraft to attack the Syrian rebel-held province of Idlib in its first major assault for months, as foreign ministers gathered in Brussels to pledge as much $5bn (£3.8bn) to support countries like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, where many Syrians have sought refuge.The bombardment of the country’s last rebel-held enclaveby Russian and Syrian planes was the most extensive yet. A full-scale assault could lead to hundreds of thousands of refugees joining the four million who have already fled the country.As many as three million people live in Idlib province, including many jihadist fighters who have been transferred to the region after the fall of other rebel enclaves, such as Homs and Aleppo.In September Turkey persuaded Russia to hold off from a full-scale attack on Idlib, but it appears Moscow is losing patience with Turkey’s efforts to disentangle the main rebel fighting group from the rest of the population. Turkey had promised to remove the militants and their heavy arms from the areas bordering regime-held areas, creating a deconfliction zone.Russia also has a history of mounting assaults at times when western leaders gather to discuss Syria.The three-day Brussels conference, culminating on Thursday, is expected to reiterate both that no refugees would be forced to return to Syria against their will and no cash for reconstruction, as opposed to humanitarian aid, would be released unless the president, Bashar al-Assad, agreed to a UN-sanctioned political settlement.The west concedes Assad will remain in power, but is using the economic leverage of possible reconstruction money to try to persuade Assad to come to terms with the opposition. A new UN special envoy, Geir Pedersen, has relaunched the year-long search for a politically balanced committee to rewrite the Syrian constitution.Idlib residents said Russian aircraft conducted at least 12 aerial strikes on residential areas, including a civilian prison on its outskirts, where they said dozens of prisoners escaped. At least 10 civilians were killed and 45 injured. More than 100 civilians have been killed since the beginning of the year.Russia’s defence ministry confirmed it had hit Idlib in coordination with Turkey, targeting drones and weapons stores of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) jihadists it said were intended for use in an attack on a major Russian airbase near the Mediterranean coast.HTS said in a statement: “There is no solution against the Russian occupier, Assad’s forces and the Iranian militias except confrontation and confrontation only.”A Russian army base, south of government-controlled Halfaya town, also targeted Kafr Zita in the northern Hama countryside while cluster bombs hit several rebel-held towns in southern Idlib, rebels said.Meanwhile, in eastern Syria, US-backed fighters besieging the final area of territory occupied by Islamic State said they had pushed further into the enclave following clashes and airstrikes.The Syrian Democratic Forces said: “Our fighters advanced deep into areas controlled by the terrorist organisation and established a number of new points, following clashes in which terrorists sustained a number of deaths and injuries.”In Brussels Syrian civil society groups used the first two days of the conference to set out how the Assad regime was wreaking vengeance on those refugees that chose to return. They also warned the hard pressed Lebanese and Jordanian governments, intent on preventing the refugees settling permanently, were trying to force the refugees home before their safety was guaranteed. Jordan houses more than 600,000 refugees, Lebanon 1 million – a sixth of the population – and Turkey has as many as 3 million.The Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, is leading a divided coalition in which some members are close to Damascus, including the refugee minister, Saleh Gharib. who complained he has been excluded from the government delegation.Lebanon is divided over the refugees with some complaining they are contributing to power cuts and joblessness.The UN has launched an appeal for $3.3bn for inside Syria, and $5.5bn is for refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries.Johannes Hahn, the EU commissioner for neighbourhood policy and enlargement, insisted “refugees need to return under conditions of safety and dignity, when, and only when, it is of their own will.”Those conditions do not currently exist. Idlib is controlled by a terrorist organisation. Reprisals have taken place in areas retaken by Damascus. Property rights are being actively undermined. There is continuing uncertainty over issues of civil documentation; and no one knows if education certificates will be recognised.Hahn said: “Damascus appears intent on screening returnees for ‘loyalty’, slowing and manipulating the issue of return. There are no ‘winners’ in this conflict. But we must seek to minimise the number of ‘losers’ in the interest of creating lasting stability in future”. He urged Lebanon to think again about refugees being able to work.The EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, is determined to maintain a political edge to the conference by insisting that refugee return would be impossible without a political settlement, including accountability for war crimes. She said: “The EU is determined to avoid that this becomes a forgotten war and a forgotten conflict. We are entering a different phase of the conflict. We risk entering a zone of no war, no peace; that is not a sustainable basis of the country to go forward.”Reuters contributed to this report",Russian and Syrian airstrikes intensify on rebel-held

"During previous bouts of militarised aggression between India and Pakistan, US presidents used personal diplomacy to convince both sides to pull back from the brink.Such was the case in 1999 during the Kargil war and then again in 2002. Similarly in December 2008 Condoleezza Rice, then US secretary of state, travelled to India to persuade the government to pull back from a planned severe response after the Mumbai attacks, putting the onus on Pakistan to cooperate transparently.It is doubtful that today either President Trump or his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has the same leverage in the region as their predecessors. The more unipolar world in which some recent American presidents operated has passed, replaced by a new era of Great Power competition between the US, Russia and China.Also, Trump has shown little interest in being even-handed in the region, increasingly siding with India and shunning Pakistan partly due to accumulating American suspicions about the role the Pakistani military has played in covertly tolerating terrorist groups on its soil and in Afghanistan, a charge Islamabad fiercely denies.Trump made his attitude towards Pakistan clear in January 2018 when he tore up plans for $1.3bn (£980m) of military aid and imposed sanctions for Pakistan’s alleged support for terrorist groups. On Twitter he bluntly accused Pakistan of “providing nothing but lies and deceit”.By contrast, the US president has feted India’s Narendra Modi, openly hailing his leadership, signing multiple military cooperation deals and renaming the US Pacific Command as Indo-Pacific Command in 2018.But American influence in the region has also fallen due to plain neglect. Trump’s attention has been elsewhere, focused on toppling Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, making friends with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and seeking to squeeze the regime in Tehran hard enough to prompt an Iranian middle-class revolt.To the extent that the US is diplomatically active in the region, it has been to secure a peace deal to end the Afghan war and bring US troops home. There is, for instance, no US assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs. The deputy assistant secretary, a career diplomat, Alice Wells, is highly regarded, but does not have the political clout of Rice, or Richard Armitage, the US deputy secretary of state at the time of the 2002 crisis, a man with two decades’ worth of contacts with the Pakistan military.There is also a sense that this crisis flared with little warning. The Kashmir dispute has rumbled on with repeated shootings across the line of control, punctuated by larger-scale terrorist outrages, but there was no prior intelligence of a major terrorist attack on Indian army recruits, let alone one large enough to prompt warplanes to fly across the frontier.The US is not alone in being blindsided. The subject was totally absent from discussion at the Munich Security Forum at the weekend. Not a single question about the looming conflict was aired, for instance, during hour-long Foreign Office questions on Tuesday. That is quite remarkable given the UK’s role in the birth of the two nations in 1948, and the large Kashmiri population in the UK.Since Tuesday, Pompeo has scrambled to catch up, urging both sides to “exercise restraint” and avoid an escalation. But given the longstanding US intelligence assessment of how quickly a war between these two countries could spiral out of control, the lack of urgency in Washington is notable.The withdrawal of America as a neutral powerbroker has left China with a degree of diplomatic influence over Pakistan that it could not claim two decades ago. China has provided Pakistan with nuclear and missile technology and equipment, conventional arms and – under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor – billions of dollars of investment in strategic projects, such as the port of Gwadar.China may yet prove to be the more decisive diplomatic influence in enforcing restraint. Pakistan’s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, not far from where Indian warplanes struck on Tuesday morning, is a major site of Chinese investment. The $1.3bn (£980m) 70-mile Thakot-Havelian road project passes through Mansehra, a district where the Indian air attacks took place. A major hydropower project is also under construction. Further military action in the area could jeopardise that investment.“We hope that both India and Pakistan can exercise restraint and adopt actions that will help stabilise the situation in the region and improve mutual relations,” the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said.Ultimately though, it may be the existence of nuclear weapons that pulls the two countries back, rather than outside intervention. With an army more than twice as large, backed by superior weaponry and with an economy 8.5 times the size of Pakistan’s, India can strike hard. But military analysts say this imbalance means Pakistan’s threshold for the use of nuclear weapons is relatively low; a direct attack by India could have incalculable consequences.",Who will pull

"The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, is under pressure to reject the resignation of the foreign minister Javad Zarif, who had announced his departure on Monday with a condemnation of what he described as the “deadly poison” of infighting among Iran’s parties and factions.News of the veteran diplomat’s resignation, which he broke in an Instagram post on Monday night, had prompted a fall in the Iranian stock exchange and a rearguard action by reformists, who had called on Rouhani, to refuse to accept it.Rouhani’s chief of staff, Mahmoud Vaezi, had earlier tweeted to strongly deny reports that Zarif’s resignation had been accepted by the president. He added later on Instagram: “In the view of Dr Rouhani, the Islamic Republic of Iran has only one foreign policy and one foreign minister.”A Instagram post from Rouhani’s supporters with the hashtag #Zarif-is-staying was however wrongly cited in reports as coming from the president himself. Rouhani has neither accepted or rejected his moderate ally’s resignation.Zarif’s surprise move came as the landmark nuclear deal he negotiated with world powers stands on the verge of collapse after the withdrawal of the US.In an interview on Tuesday, published by the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, Zarif said infighting was a barrier to formulating foreign policy, suggesting he may have resigned over pressure from hardline elements opposed to his role in negotiating the 2015 agreement.“We first have to remove our foreign policy from the issue of party and factional fighting,” Zarif said. “The deadly poison for foreign policy is for foreign policy to become an issue of party and factional fighting.”A majority of Iranian parliamentarians signed a petition calling for him to stay in office, according to a spokesman for parliament’s national security and foreign policy commission.There were also reports that Iranian diplomats internationally were threatening to resign in solidarity with Zarif and provoke a wider foreign policy crisis. In a statement, Zarif urged other diplomats not to follow his course of action, saying the aim of his resignation was to strengthen his department.In his resignation note, Zarif apologised for his “shortcomings” and “inability to continue serving”.There were informed reports that he was angry at being excluded from a meeting between the Iranian leadership and Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian president made a rare visit to Tehran on Monday.The future of Syria is critical to Iranian foreign policy, and Zarif’s exclusion from a meeting between Rouhani and Assad was taken as a snub that undermined the prestige and efficiency of the foreign ministry. It is said to be one of a series of clashes between the office of the president and the foreign ministry.On Sunday, Zarif had criticised Iranian hardliners in a speech in Tehran, saying: “We cannot hide behind imperialism’s plot and blame them for our own incapability. Independence does not mean isolation from the world.”Zarif’s resignation leaves Rouhani without one of his main allies in pushing the Iran towards more negotiation with the west. Analysts have said Rouhani faces growing political pressure from hardliners in the government as the unravelling nuclear deal further strains the economy.Zarif, who is fluent in English, is seen as the acceptable face of Iranian diplomacy to the west, which has made him the subject of relentless attack by hardliners, especially over his role in championing the nuclear deal.Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement last year, leaving Europe to make limited efforts to prevent powerful US sanctions from destroying Iranian hopes of increasing trade with the west – the supposed benefit of the deal from the Iranian standpoint.European diplomats were aghast at Zarif’s resignation, potentially losing their chief interlocutor, and angrily condemning the US for pushing him over the edge. One diplomat likened the US administration’s attitude to Marxist revolutionaries worshipping at the altar of change and disruption.The EU has long warned sanctions that cripple the Iranian economy will only weaken reformists in Tehran, and not usher in the kind of democratic revolution that the Trump team seem to be seeking to engineer.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, tweeted his reaction to Zarif’s announcement.We note @JZarif’s resignation. We’ll see if it sticks. Either way, he and @HassanRouhani are just front men for a corrupt religious mafia. We know @khamenei_ir makes all final decisions. Our policy is unchanged—the regime must behave like a normal country and respect its people.A US state department official tweeted an unflattering gif of Zarif, saying: “How do you know @JZarif is lying? His lips are moving.”Zarif served as Iran’s ambassador to the UN from 2002 to 2007, first under the reformist president Mohammad Khatami and then under the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Later, secret talks between the US and Iran in Oman became fully fledged negotiations over its nuclear programme. During the talks, Zarif met the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, more than 50 times – something unimaginable years earlier.",Supporters call on Iranian president to reject foreign minister's

"Mohammad Javad Zarif was Iran’s lead negotiator of the 2015 nuclear deal, and if his resignation is accepted, it will be another large nail in the agreement’s mostly sealed coffin.Iran’s presidential chief of staff Mahmoud Vaezi denied the resignation had been accepted. But for the president, Hassan Rouhani, the departure of such a close ally at a time of prolonged intense political pressure will be a serious blow.It will be the reaction of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, which will determine Zarif’s fate. He has threatened to resign before as the nuclear deal came under sustained criticism by hardliners, but never so publicly.Zarif is quoted in the Iranian media as saying that the immediate cause of his abrupt offer to resign, announced in the middle of the night on Instagram, was the fact that he was not invited to meet Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian dictator visited Tehran on Monday. By some accounts he was not even informed in advance about the visit.The news website Entekhab quoted him as referring to himself in the third person and saying “after the pictures of the meetings today, Javad Zarif has no credibility in the world as a foreign minister.”Policy in Syria is largely run by the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and its leader Qassem Suleimani, but Zarif has participated in meetings with Assad before, and his exclusion from invitation list seems to be a clear snub. It also appears to signal a downgrading of the importance of the foreign ministry and its advocacy of openness to the world and keeping faith with the nuclear deal.Since Donald Trump took the US out of the multilateral agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), by which Iran accepted severe constraints on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, there has been a rising chorus of calls in Iran for it to cease abiding by the deal’s restrictions.The European states who were party to the agreement – the UK, France, Germany and Russia – along with China have urged Tehran to stick with the agreement, and have tried to devise ways of bypassing US sanctions.However, the threat of secondary US sanctions on any companies trading with Iran has been enough to scare most foreign investors and traders out, robbing Iran of any substantial benefits from the deal.Jamal Abdi, the head of the National Iranian-American Council, a pro-diplomacy advocacy group, said “Zarif’s resignation is a boon for the radical hardline forces in Tehran who oppose the JCPOA and further engagement with the West. While Zarif is not above criticism, over the past forty years, the US and Iran have had few clear channels for negotiations, and Zarif has long been a major proponent of US-Iran negotiations and deescalation. Trump’s plan to collapse the nuclear deal may indeed be aimed at empowering radicals in Iran.”",Javad Zarif's resignation: blow for nuclear deal and win for Iran's hardliners,2019-02-26/00:14:11+0000,mohammad javad zarif was iran s lead negotiator of the  nuclear deal and if his resignation is accepted it will be another large nail in the agreement s mostly sealed coffin iran s presidential chief of staff mahmoud vaezi denied the resignation had been accepted but for the president hassan rouhani the departure of such a close ally at a time of prolonged intense political pressure will be a serious blow it will be the reaction of the supreme leader ali khamenei which will determine zarif s fate he has threatened to resign before as the nuclear deal came under sustained criticism by hardliners but never so publicly zarif is quoted in the iranian media as saying that the immediate cause of his abrupt offer to resign announced in the middle of the night on instagram was the fact that he was not invited to meet bashar al assad when the syrian dictator visited tehran on monday by some accounts he was not even informed in advance about the visit the news website entekhab quoted him as referring to himself in the third person and saying after the pictures of the meetings today javad zarif has no credibility in the world as a foreign minister policy in syria is largely run by the quds force of the islamic revolutionary guard corps and its leader qassem suleimani but zarif has participated in meetings with assad before and his exclusion from invitation list seems to be a clear snub it also appears to signal a downgrading of the importance of the foreign ministry and its advocacy of openness to the world and keeping faith with the nuclear deal since donald trump took the us out of the multilateral agreement known as the joint comprehensive programme of action jcpoa by which iran accepted severe constraints on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief there has been a rising chorus of calls in iran for it to cease abiding by the deal s restrictions the european states who were party to the agreement the uk france germany and russia along with china have urged tehran to stick with the agreement and have tried to devise ways of bypassing us sanctions however the threat of secondary us sanctions on any companies trading with iran has been enough to scare most foreign investors and traders out robbing iran of any substantial benefits from the deal jamal abdi the head of the national iranian american council a pro diplomacy advocacy group said zarif s resignation is a boon for the radical hardline forces in tehran who oppose the jcpoa and further engagement with the west while zarif is not above criticism over the past forty years the us and iran have had few clear channels for negotiations and zarif has long been a major proponent of us iran negotiations and deescalation trump s plan to collapse the nuclear deal may indeed be aimed at empowering radicals in iran ,Iran Sanctions,0.238087863
"The Iranian public are on the brink of abandoning faith in the nuclear deal signed with Europe and other world powers in 2015, putting pressure on the regime to pull out of the deal, Iran’s foreign minister has said.Speaking at the Munich security conference, Javad Zarif also accused Israel of seeking war with Iran and said Europe needed to be prepared to “get wet if it wants to swim against the dangerous tide of US unilateralism”.Zarif said 51% of the Iranian public still backed the deal, as he said the European Union had fallen short in setting up a mechanism to help EU firms trade with Iran after Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal and reimposed sanctions.He said Europe had made all the right statements on the nuclear deal “but it has not been prepared to make the investments, pay the price”.Zarif said Iran had “long been the target of an unhealthy fixation, let’s say obsession” from the US. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, had “arrogantly demanded that Europe must join the United States in undermining its own security and breaking its obligations” over the nuclear deal.He also warned of increased tensions with Israel, which carried out a series of airstrikes last month against what it said were facilities belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ al-Quds force in Syria.“Certainly, some people are looking for war ... Israel,” Zarif said. “The risk is great and the risk will be even greater if you continue to turn a blind eye to severe violations of international law.” Zarif defended Iran’s role in Syria, which he said was at the request of the Syrian government, and said it intended to stay in the country as long as it was asked to do so.Zarif also addressed claims by the Netherlands, France and Denmark that Tehran has been mounting attacks in Europe over the past year.The Dutch government alleges that Iran organised two assassinations of Dutch-Iranian activists in 2015 and 2017. Denmark has said it stopped a Tehran-led plot to kill an Arab-Iranian opposition figure on its soil last year. France charged Iran with an attack on a rally of an exiled Iranian dissident group near Paris in 2018. Iran denies any involvement in the plots.“It could be a false flag operation, entrapment, rogue operation, but it is not the work of a government that you should call crazy if we did it.”Zarif’s underlying message was that Europe needed to do more to protect the Iranian reformers in Tehran from public pressure to abandon the deal as a mirage bringing no benefit.The EU has announced a mechanism designed to encourage trade in humanitarian goods such as food and medicines but it is unlikely to boost European-Iranian trade, which is often seen by Iran as the quid pro quo for cooperating over its nuclear programme.Zarif also rejected claims that Iran was in breach of UN resolutions by developing a missile programme for defensive purposes.

"The Nato alliance is about decency and dependability, not just cash and contributions, Germany’s defence minister has said in a rebuke to Donald Trump over his insistence that European countries rapidly increase their defence spending.Ursula von der Leyen told a gathering of defence ministers in Munich the alliance was about fairness in collective decision-making, and not just during military missions.As the conference opened a study was published showing that European Nato members would have to raise their defence spending by £102bn a year to hit the 2% of GDP target set for 2024. That would require a 38% increase in spending, the International Institute for Strategic Studies said in its annual military balance report.The failure of Washington’s European allies to get even close to that figure has infuriated the US president, who accuses them of freeloading. The US accounts for 70% of Nato states’ defence spending, the report found. It spent nearly $650bn (£506bn) in 2018, compared with around $250bn for all the European Nato members combined.Trump’s anger over spending has fuelled concern about his commitment to the alliance. At a Nato summit in Brussels last year he made a blistering public attack on Berlin in a televised meeting with Angela Merkel.Von der Leyen tried to defuse a potential replay of that row on Friday by insisting that calls for Germany to increase defence spending were justified. She also pointed out that the call to hit 2% had been made by Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, but added, pointedly: “Yes, Nato is about cash and contributions but it is also about decency and dependability.”Tensions are also likely to surface at the conference over the unilateral style of US foreign policy. Polls before the gathering found that most French and German respondents had greater confidence in Vladimir Putin’s leadership than Trump’s.In an index of the damage caused by Trump’s “diplomacy by tweet” approach, defence ministers met to discuss the latest stage in the fight to defeat Islamic State (Isis) in north-east Syria after his unilateral decision to withdraw the 2,000 US troops in the country.Pat Shanahan, on his first trip abroad as the acting US defence secretary, said he foresaw a “bigger and stronger” US-led coalition combatting Isis globally as Washington pulls its troops out of Syria.“While the time for US troops on the ground in north-east Syria winds down, the United States remains committed to our coalition’s cause, the permanent defeat of Isis, both in the Middle East and beyond,” Shanahan said in remarks to reporters.Trump’s decision, which as yet lacks a clear timetable, angered some allies, confounded US military officials and prompted Jim Mattis to resign as defence secretary. It also left a strategic question about how to secure the mainly Kurdish north-east of Syria, where Turkey wants to impose an exclusion zone.European officials said they were given few details during the closed-door meeting in Munich and many questions remain. “We are still trying to understand how the Americans plan to withdraw,” one European official told Reuters.The French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was mystery how the US said it wanted to be tough on Iran, and yet was leaving Syria in a way that will leave Iran stronger.Republican senator Lindsey Graham told the conference the US would be asking allies to contribute forces to help stabilise areas liberated from Isis, drawing scepticism from a French diplomat who said: “Once the Americans leave we’ll be forced to leave. We aren’t going to be the patsy for the Americans.” The differences between the EU and US also extend to whether to seek a replacement to the INF nuclear arms treaty, from which the US and Russia have withdrawn, accusing one another of violations. Germany would like a broader replacement treaty that embraces China, but the IISS pointed out that if the terms of the current treaty were imposed on China, it would have to destroy 95% of its cruise and ballistic missile arsenal.The US was also unrepentant about its ad hoc anti-Iran summit in Warsaw this week, saying the event was not a one-off and would lead to a new, permanent anti-Iranian coalition spanning Arab states, the US and Israel. The alliance will confront Iran’s aggressive drive to build a Shia crescent and new dynamic across the Middle East, according to the US special representative on Iran, Brian Hook.The claim will alarm European leaders further because they face a concerted joint drive by Washington and its Arab allies to crush the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and bring about a form of regime change in Tehran through economic sanctions.Iranian aggression across the region “had done an excellent job in driving Arab states and Israel much closer together,” Hook said.

"The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has sharply rebuked Washington’s European allies over their efforts to shield their businesses from US sanctions on Iran, as transatlantic tensions over US foreign policy were laid bare at a conference in Warsaw.A scheme the European Union has set up to facilitate trade with Iran was “an effort to break American sanctions against Iran’s murderous revolutionary regime”, Pence said during a conference on the Middle East organised by the US in the Polish capital.“It is an ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran, weaken the EU and create still more distance between Europe and the US,” he said.In an unusually blunt and fiery address, Pence called on what he described as “freedom-loving nations” to stand against Iranian “evil”, and went so far as to accuse the regional power of plotting a “new Holocaust”.The Warsaw meeting was attended by more than 60 nations, but major European powers such as Germany and France, parties to the landmark 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, refused to send their top diplomats. The US-led summit focused on Iran but also the Israeli-Palestinian issue, over which European leaders have expressed frustration at Donald Trump’s aid cuts and diplomatic attacks against Palestinians.The US was represented in Warsaw by Pence, Mike Pompeo, Washington’s top diplomat, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and special aide on the Middle East. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also attended.The Obama administration eased US sanctions on Iran under the terms of the nuclear deal, but Trump reimposed them when he withdrew the US from the agreement last year.“You can’t achieve stability in the Middle East without confronting Iran. It’s just not possible,” Pompeo told reporters after his formal opening statement. “There are malign influences in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq … The three H’s: the Houthis, Hamas and Hezbollah, these are real threats,” he said, referring to groups Iran supports.Netanyahu had earlier withdrawn a claim on his Twitter account, said to be the result of a mistranslation, that he was in Warsaw to discuss war with Iran.Pence praised other nations for complying with US sanctions by reducing Iranian oil imports, but said the Europeans fell short. “Sadly, some of our leading European partners have not been nearly as cooperative,” Pence said. “In fact, they have led the effort to create mechanisms to break up our sanctions.”Pence then called for Europe to abandon the nuclear agreement altogether, making explicit a demand that Trump administration officials had previously only hinted at.European diplomats at the conference rejected Pence’s accusations. “We strongly disagree,” a diplomat from a major European power told Reuters.Netanyahu described the opening dinner at which he sat alongside senior officials from Arab Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, as a “historical turning point”. Many Arab states do not recognise Israel but they have been driven together by their common fear of Iran.It remains to be seen how far the new alliance can extend to a combined approach to the Palestinian issue. It is expected Kushner will discuss his peace plan with Arab leaders in private as well as at a public session on the sidelines of the summit.Netanyahu has argued that the Arab world is open to normalised economic ties with Israel that are not dependent on a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Pompeo’s call in his opening speech for a new era of cooperation in the Middle East will be viewed with scepticism by EU leaders, who feel they were not consulted on the US decision to pull out of the Iran deal, or the planned withdrawal of 2,000 US troops from Syria.In a sign of transatlantic division, Niels Annen, a German minister of state for foreign affairs, said he was sceptical that the conference could deliver results on Iran. “I am hoping for constructive signals but nobody here has the expectation that this conference will solve problems,” he told reporters.The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, described the Warsaw conference as “dead on arrival” and another attempt by the US to pursue an unfounded obsession with Iran.A former US ambassador to Sweden, Azita Raji, also dismissed the event, saying “conducting a lacklustre and rambling conference on the Middle East shows that it is amateur hour at the White House and is ultimately another blow to US prestige and leadership”.The Warsaw conference came as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, increasingly seen as a key player in the Middle East, hosted his Iranian and Turkish counterparts to discuss a final settlement in the Syrian civil war, including the presence of large numbers of Islamist fighters in Idlib province.The three countries, particularly Turkey and Iran, do not agree on the final settlement in Syria, but have been uneasily cooperating to find a solution that does not betray their interests.Iran wants Turkey to agree that Syrian forces should be deployed along the border with Turkey, but there has also been a separate US discussion of an international force to assuage Kurdish fears of Turkish invasion once US forces depart.The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Wednesday that the leaders would also discuss forming a special committee tasked with drawing up a new postwar constitution for Syria. The composition of the committee, including the role of civil society, has been in dispute for more than a year.Associated Press contributed to this report",Mike Pence chides US allies at Warsaw

"Does Mike Pompeo realise what a foolish figure he cuts as he shambles around Europe, spouting risible tosh about Donald Trump’s commitment to a “new liberal order” and America as “force for good” in the Middle East? It seems he does not. Pompeo is a former soldier, Tea Party Republican, hawkish CIA chief and enthusiastic torture advocate who complained in 2013 that Guantanamo Bay inmates on hunger strike had “put on weight”. Self-awareness is not really his thing.Whatever else he is, Pompeo is plainly no diplomat. Yet thanks to Trump, his job since April last year is US secretary of state, arguably the world’s most influential diplomatic post. It’s a role previously held by such towering figures as James Monroe, John Foster Dulles and George Shultz. By comparison, Pompeo is a political pufferfish floundering out of his depth. His latest self-inflicted embarrassment is Wednesday’s conference in Warsaw, envisaged (by him) as an international rally to put pressure on Iran.The EU (including Britain) rightly regards Trump’s vendetta against Iran as dangerous and counter-productiveIn the week Iran noisily celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Islamic revolution and its leaders dared the US to do its worst, Pompeo mounted a demonstration of his own. His cunning wheeze was to bring together the pliant nations of Europe and the Arab world in an American-led show of unity that would convince the terrified mullahs to forsake their “malign” activities. What this inept bumbling has achieved instead is to startlingly expose the deep and widening divisions between the US and its principal European allies.Although the state department belatedly broadened the scope of the conference, the foreign ministers of France and Germany have boycotted Pompeo’s misconceived anti-Tehran hooley. So, too, has Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief who played a key role in securing the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that Trump reneged on last year. The EU (and this, for the moment, includes Britain) rightly regards Trump’s vendetta against Iran as dangerous and counter-productive. Poor old Pompeo is seen as mere bagman, slavishly projecting his master’s voice.Trump’s war of attrition against Tehran is accelerating rapidly. He misses no opportunity to denigrate Iran as the “world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism”, a phrase repeated to Republican applause in last week’s State of the Union address. The administration is threatening to follow up last year’s renewed, punitive US sanctions by cancelling oil import waivers for Iranian customers such as Italy and Greece. And it is pushing hard to undermine EU efforts to preserve Tehran’s adherence to the nuclear deal by maintaining non-dollar trade.While Pompeo and Mike Pence, Trump’s vice-president, characterise the Warsaw conference as an attempt to create “a better, more stable Middle East”, it is ever clearer that Trump’s Iran obsession is distorting long-held policy goals and destabilising regional partners. The president’s rash decision to withdraw US troops from Syria – opposed by Nato allies, Congress and Pentagon generals – was motivated primarily by his desire to redeploy these forces to “keep watch” on Iran. To do so, he apparently plans to expand residual American bases in Iraq.Eight years after Barack Obama ended the Iraq war, Iraq’s Shia leadership and political parties, with close ties to Iran, are understandably alarmed at the prospect of the Americans returning – and using their country as a launchpad for a new conflict. Iraq’s Sunni minority – already the focus of efforts to regroup by displaced Isis terrorists – is not enamoured of the idea either. Having failed to consult Iraq in advance, Patrick Shanahan, Trump’s stand-in defence secretary, was in Baghdad this week trying to calm tempers.European allies are meanwhile dismayed by both the signals Trump is sending and the company he keeps. Despite this week’s cornering of Isis in south-east Syria, they see a troop pullout as premature, and an invitation to the jihadis to bide their time and wait to fight another day. They see it as a strategic capitulation to Russia and tacit acceptance of Bashar al-Assad’s survival. And they see it as a betrayal of the west’s Kurdish allies and a green light for Turkey’s autocratic leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to attack them.Of even wider concern is the de facto alternative coalition that is coalescing around Trump’s banner, symbolised by Pompeo’s Polish waffle-fest. The unelected princes, panjandrums and potentates of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf – inveterate, unreasoning foes of Iran – are in Warsaw in force. They actively encourage the White House on its collision course with Tehran. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is another keen conference attendee. He is presently authorising almost daily airstrikes against reported Iranian targets inside Syria, with Trump’s approval.Then there are the conference hosts. Poland’s rightwing rulers, at odds with Brussels over domestic policy, find a more congenial partner in Washington. Like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, who Pompeo courted earlier this week, they share Trump’s aggressive nationalist-populist predilections. To their way of thinking, if the US wants to go after Iran, then so be it. It matters not, apparently, that Palestine, Yemen, Idlib, gross mis-governance and human rights abuses in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Sudan, and a host of other problems are considerably more inimical to long-term Middle East stability than is beleaguered, battered Iran.Pompeo’s Warsaw war rally marks another stage in the deliberate, Trumpian process of dividing and disrupting the postwar western alliance, to the point of disintegration. If it were not obvious already, this week’s bellicose tub-thumping demonstrates that Britain, France and Germany can no longer rely on rational, informed, balanced US leadership. And Iran cannot rely on the European powers to stop Trump’s next war of choice.• Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",Trump’s Iran summit shows just how far he is from the rest of the

"Key European powers will offer only limited participation in a high-profile Trump administration summit on the Middle East starting on Wednesday, reflecting their growing anger over unilateral US policymaking on Iran and Syria.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will leave the Warsaw summit early, pleading Brexit Commons business, while France is sending a civil servant and Germany its junior foreign minister.Federica Mogherini, the EU external affairs chief, will boycott the event, originally conceived by the US as a way to press EU countries to adopt a more aggressive stance towards Iran.The original summit agenda was scrapped after Europe told Washington it was “not a very smart idea” to hold a summit that would highlight Europe’s differences with the US over Iran. The EU was not consulted before Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, announced the summit, jointly hosted with Poland.Despite retitling the agenda to focus on peace and security in the Middle East, European diplomats remain sceptical that figures such as Pompeo and the US vice-president, Mike Pence, will dial down their anti-Iran rhetoric at the summit.The EU remains strongly supportive of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that was abandoned by the US, even if it criticises Iran’s ballistic missile programme. It has finally devised a preliminary trading vehicle to resist US secondary sanctions on firms that continue to trade with Iran.The presence of leading anti-Iran Gulf states as well as Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu in Warsaw will underline how hostility towards Iran can bring some Arab states and Israel together. One western diplomat said it would be the first meeting between Arab states and Israel since 1991 Madrid peace conference.Non-attendees include Qatar, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran and the Palestinian Authority.The US has signalled it will extend sanctions on Iranian oil exports in May. Brian Hook, the US special representative on Iran, said last week: “We are not looking to grant any future waivers or exceptions to our sanctions regime, whether it’s oil or anything else,” adding that the US aims to “get to zero imports” of Iranian crude as quickly as possible.The Trump’s administration exempted eight counties from its sanctions, allowing them to continue importing crude from Iran for six months up to May.British officials are privately sceptical about the rhetoric coming from Washington that it might impose sanctions on the proposed mechanism being set up by Europe to help trade, initially in unsanctioned goods such as food and medicines.The Foreign Office permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, would have to be one of those sanctioned by Washington since he is on the board of the new EU body.Meanwhile, differences between Europe and the US over Syria were exposed in the Commons on Monday when Hunt was unusually open in expressing his qualms about Trump’s call for the unilateral withdrawal of 2,000 US troops from Syria.He told MPs: “It is important we do not declare victory too quickly. If we do so, we risk Daesh [Islamic State] re-establishing a territorial foothold. Indeed, concerns are already being expressed that that is beginning to happen in parts of Iraq now. We should not mistake territorial defeat for final defeat.”Hunt said it was “encouraging that, although the original announcement suggested this withdrawal would happen very quickly, the US has behaved with considerable pragmatism in practice”.He signalled his determination that the US departure should not leave its Kurdish allies in northern Syria exposed to a potential Turkish attack. “Were we to let them down now, it would send a terrible signal about our commitment to our allies for any future conflict in which we might be engaged,” Hunt told MPs. The Kurdish-led SDF has detained a total of 900 foreign fighters who joined Isis during the Syrian civil war. Hunt said urgent consultations were under way in Whitehall about whether to take back British fighters and their families if the SDF decided it could no longer hold them.

"Iraq’s president has hit back at comments made by Donald Trump, saying that the US president did not ask Iraq’s permission for US troops stationed there to “watch Iran”.A day after Trump said US soldiers in Iraq would be tasked with monitoring Iran, Barham Salih told reporters at a forum in Baghdad that the US military presence in the country was the result of a bilateral agreement with the specific goal of fighting terrorism.“Don’t overburden Iraq with your own issues,” Salih said on Monday. “The US is a major power ... but do not pursue your own policy priorities, we live here.”It was of “fundamental interest” for Iraq to have good relations with Iran and other neighbouring countries, Salih added.Combating Iranian influence in the region has emerged as the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s Middle East policy. The US decision to reimpose sanctions lifted under former president Barack Obama, as well as new measures targeting Iran’s oil, banking and shipping industries has left Baghdad caught in the middle of growing tensions between its two biggest allies. In an interview with CBS aired on Sunday evening Trump said Iraq was “perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East rather than pulling up,” adding that Iran was a “real problem”. “We’re going to keep watching and we’re going to keep seeing and if there’s trouble,” he said. “If somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we’re going to know it before they do.”The fortune the US spent on the Ayn al-Assad airbase west of Ramadi must be used effectively and US troops must stay in the region to protect Israel, the president continued.Hassan Karim al-Kaabi, Iraq’s deputy speaker of parliament, said Trump’s latest comments were a “blatant and overt violation of sovereignty and national will”, according to local media.Trump also angered Iraqi politicians in December after a three-hour visit to troops at Ayn al-Assad over Christmas, which did not include meetings with the Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, or any other officials.The US is reportedly in negotiations with Baghdad over redeploying some of the 2,000 special forces currently stationed in north-east Syria to American bases in Iraq, following Trump’s surprise decision last December to withdraw from the country.US troops in Kurdish-held Syria – deployed in the fight against Isis – have also acted as a buffer between US-allied Kurdish militias and neighbouring Turkey – which has threatened a full-scale military offensive to dismantle Kurdish groups it says are a terrorist threat.Many analysts believe the decision will serve to strengthen Iran’s presence in Syria, allowing Tehran greater access to oilfields in the north-east and unchecked freedom of movement for Iranian-backed forces in the border region with Iraq.","US troops do not have permission to 'watch Iran', says Baghdad",2019-02-04/15:31:50+0000,iraq s president has hit back at comments made by donald trump saying that the us president did not ask iraq s permission for us troops stationed there to watch iran a day after trump said us soldiers in iraq would be tasked with monitoring iran barham salih told reporters at a forum in baghdad that the us military presence in the country was the result of a bilateral agreement with the specific goal of fighting terrorism don t overburden iraq with your own issues salih said on monday the us is a major power but do not pursue your own policy priorities we live here it was of fundamental interest for iraq to have good relations with iran and other neighbouring countries salih added combating iranian influence in the region has emerged as the cornerstone of the trump administration s middle east policy the us decision to reimpose sanctions lifted under former president barack obama as well as new measures targeting iran s oil banking and shipping industries has left baghdad caught in the middle of growing tensions between its two biggest allies in an interview with cbs aired on sunday evening trump said iraq was perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled middle east rather than pulling up adding that iran was a real problem we re going to keep watching and we re going to keep seeing and if there s trouble he said if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things we re going to know it before they do the fortune the us spent on the ayn al assad airbase west of ramadi must be used effectively and us troops must stay in the region to protect israel the president continued hassan karim al kaabi iraq s deputy speaker of parliament said trump s latest comments were a blatant and overt violation of sovereignty and national will according to local media trump also angered iraqi politicians in december after a three hour visit to troops at ayn al assad over christmas which did not include meetings with the iraqi prime minister adel abdul mahdi or any other officials the us is reportedly in negotiations with baghdad over redeploying some of the   special forces currently stationed in north east syria to american bases in iraq following trump s surprise decision last december to withdraw from the country us troops in kurdish held syria deployed in the fight against isis have also acted as a buffer between us allied kurdish militias and neighbouring turkey which has threatened a full scale military offensive to dismantle kurdish groups it says are a terrorist threat many analysts believe the decision will serve to strengthen iran s presence in syria allowing tehran greater access to oilfields in the north east and unchecked freedom of movement for iranian backed forces in the border region with iraq ,Iran Sanctions,0.384096652
"France, Germany and Britain have set up a financial mechanism designed to avoid US sanctions against Iran and keep the 2015 nuclear deal afloat.Through the Instex trade vehicle, they hope to assert European economic sovereignty in the face of Washington’s determination to impose its foreign policy on Europe.The strategy would initially focus on trying to ease the flow of humanitarian supplies to Iran, the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said. Such supplies, including medicines and foodstuffs, are not supposed to be subject to US sanctions.Eventually, the plan is for the vehicle to expand to allow European firms to trade more freely with Iran in a range of goods, including those subject to US sanctions, the EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, said.Instex, which stands for “instrument for support of trade exchanges”, was registered this week, and will act as a proposed payment channel from Europe to Iran, and vice versa. It will not be fully operational until later this year. Iran will be expected to establish a parallel organisation. If the scheme works, it is likely to be most useful to small- and medium-sized firms with no links in the US.The body is being designed and run by Britain, France and Germany but will receive the endorsement of the entire EU on Thursday. Further details are expected to be unveiled at a meeting of European foreign and defence ministers in Bucharest.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said: “The entity will facilitate legitimate trade under European and international law. Its immediate focus will be on enabling trade in goods where the immediate need of the Iranian people is greatest, ie foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods.”Hunt said the nuclear deal was “crucial for the security of the region”, but stressed the initiative did not in any way absolve Iran from needing to end its other hostile and destabilising activities. The EU refused to follow Donald Trump last year in pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Washington says that, although Iran has met the terms, the accord was too generous, failing to rein in Iran’s ballistic missile programme or curb its regional meddling.Ever since, European firms have been faced with ever more assertive, and broadly effective US treasury measures to scare them off trading with Iran. Many multinationals have pulled investments from Iran, plunging an already struggling Iranian economy into further difficulty.Tehran has been pressing for progress on the payment channel for months, occasionally threatening to pull out of the deal unless the EU showed greater urgency on what is a highly technical banking and legal exercise.A key question is whether the US will see Instex, as initially constructed, as a legitimate target for sanctions by the US treasury, since it has warned any European entity trading with Iran with US connections or using dollars can be subject to punitive fines.Instex’s initial purpose of easing the flow of supplies such as food and medicines to Iran might protect the body since the US sanctions net is not meant to extend to humanitarian supplies.In 2017, the export of drugs from Europe to Iran was worth $884m compared with $194m from China and $52m from India, according to UN data.Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, the founder of a Europe-Iran business forum said the mechanism, even if limited, could eventually pave the way for something more ambitious.“It could turn into a pilot that the US would find difficult to target with political legitimacy given its humanitarian focus,” he said.The US embassy in Berlin said Washington did not expect the payment system to reduce economic pressure on Iran. An embassy spokesperson repeated Trump’s threat that all who continued to do business with Iran would be subject to US sanctions.A high-level European diplomatic representation on the Instex supervisory board may act as a firewall preventing the Trump administration from imposing sanctions.Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the success of the vehicle would depend on expert meetings that Iran would subsequently have with the Europeans, including between central banks.With the UK planning to leave the EU, London is less motivated than French and German politicians to see the vehicle as the start of a wider drive to establish a euro-based rival for the dollar. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has repeatedly called for greater European autonomy, and the EU is studying plans to challenge dollar dominance.",Europe sets up scheme to get round US sanctions on Iran,2019-01-31/16:09:51+0000,france germany and britain have set up a financial mechanism designed to avoid us sanctions against iran and keep the  nuclear deal afloat through the instex trade vehicle they hope to assert european economic sovereignty in the face of washington s determination to impose its foreign policy on europe the strategy would initially focus on trying to ease the flow of humanitarian supplies to iran the german foreign minister heiko maas said such supplies including medicines and foodstuffs are not supposed to be subject to us sanctions eventually the plan is for the vehicle to expand to allow european firms to trade more freely with iran in a range of goods including those subject to us sanctions the eu foreign affairs chief federica mogherini said instex which stands for instrument for support of trade exchanges was registered this week and will act as a proposed payment channel from europe to iran and vice versa it will not be fully operational until later this year iran will be expected to establish a parallel organisation if the scheme works it is likely to be most useful to small and medium sized firms with no links in the us the body is being designed and run by britain france and germany but will receive the endorsement of the entire eu on thursday further details are expected to be unveiled at a meeting of european foreign and defence ministers in bucharest the uk foreign secretary jeremy hunt said the entity will facilitate legitimate trade under european and international law its immediate focus will be on enabling trade in goods where the immediate need of the iranian people is greatest ie foodstuffs pharmaceuticals and consumer goods hunt said the nuclear deal was crucial for the security of the region but stressed the initiative did not in any way absolve iran from needing to end its other hostile and destabilising activities the eu refused to follow donald trump last year in pulling out of the  nuclear deal washington says that although iran has met the terms the accord was too generous failing to rein in iran s ballistic missile programme or curb its regional meddling ever since european firms have been faced with ever more assertive and broadly effective us treasury measures to scare them off trading with iran many multinationals have pulled investments from iran plunging an already struggling iranian economy into further difficulty tehran has been pressing for progress on the payment channel for months occasionally threatening to pull out of the deal unless the eu showed greater urgency on what is a highly technical banking and legal exercise a key question is whether the us will see instex as initially constructed as a legitimate target for sanctions by the us treasury since it has warned any european entity trading with iran with us connections or using dollars can be subject to punitive fines instex s initial purpose of easing the flow of supplies such as food and medicines to iran might protect the body since the us sanctions net is not meant to extend to humanitarian supplies in  the export of drugs from europe to iran was worth m compared with m from china and m from india according to un data esfandyar batmanghelidj the founder of a europe iran business forum said the mechanism even if limited could eventually pave the way for something more ambitious it could turn into a pilot that the us would find difficult to target with political legitimacy given its humanitarian focus he said the us embassy in berlin said washington did not expect the payment system to reduce economic pressure on iran an embassy spokesperson repeated trump s threat that all who continued to do business with iran would be subject to us sanctions a high level european diplomatic representation on the instex supervisory board may act as a firewall preventing the trump administration from imposing sanctions iran s deputy foreign minister abbas araghchi said the success of the vehicle would depend on expert meetings that iran would subsequently have with the europeans including between central banks with the uk planning to leave the eu london is less motivated than french and german politicians to see the vehicle as the start of a wider drive to establish a euro based rival for the dollar the french finance minister bruno le maire has repeatedly called for greater european autonomy and the eu is studying plans to challenge dollar dominance ,Iran Sanctions,0.198053896
"The head of US intelligence has said that North Korea is “unlikely to give up” its nuclear weapons because its leadership sees them as “critical to regime survival” – in comments which contrasted sharply with Donald Trump’s own assessment.Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, made his assessment in a written statement on “worldwide threats” to the Senate on Tuesday, which was noteworthy for the many ways it differed from the rhetoric favoured by the president and his top aides.The gaps were not only evident on North Korea, but also on Iran’s nuclear programme, the continuing threat of the Islamic State in Syria and on the importance of climate change. The distance between the White House and its intelligence agencies was highlighted further in verbal testimony to the Senate intelligence committee by Coats, alongside the heads of the CIA, DIA and NSA who also testified.Coats’s assessment on North Korean intentions had particular impact as it comes in the run-up to a planned second summit at the end of February between Trump and Kim Jong-un.Trump has rejected repeated reports that – while the Pyongyang regime has halted nuclear and missile tests since the first summit in Singapore last June – it has not paused its production of nuclear weapons and may have stepped it up.“The media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with North Korea,” Trump complained in a tweet last week. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has insisted that the diplomatic effort was aimed at complete North Korean disarmament.In his written testimony, however, Coats said: “We continue to assess that North Korea is unlikely to give up all of its nuclear weapons and production capabilities, even as it seeks to negotiate partial denuclearization steps to obtain key US and international concessions.”“North Korean leaders view nuclear arms as critical to regime survival,” Coats argued.He went on to point out that Kim Jong-un’s pledge in Singapore to pursue the “complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” – which Trump and Pompeo portrayed as a historic breakthrough – was no more than “a formulation linked to past demands that include an end to US military deployments and exercises involving advanced US capabilities”.That assessment of North Korea was echoed by the head of the Defence Intelligence Agency, Lt Gen Robert Ashley. He told the Senate committee: “The capability and threat that existed a year ago are still there.”In contrast, Coats said that US intelligence “continue to assess that Iran is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities we judge necessary to produce a nuclear device”.He noted that Iran’s activities are limited by the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but as Iran derives ever fewer benefits from the deal, hardliners are pressing for the state to break free of those constraints.Trump abrogated the JCPOA in May last year and his administration has threatened sanctions against anyone doing business with Iran.Pompeo and the national security adviser, John Bolton, have described Iran as the biggest terrorist threat in the world, but the intelligence community’s worldwide threats assessment does not echo that view. It lists Iran below Isis and al-Qaida and homegrown extremists.The intelligence report also represented a rejoinder to Trump’s claims of victory over Isis in Syria.Coats’s written testimony said: “Isis still commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria, and it maintains eight branches, more than a dozen networks, and thousands of dispersed supporters around the world, despite significant leadership and territorial losses.”On a day that Trump ridiculed concern about climate change because of the current blast of arctic weather in the midwest, the intelligence report also includes sombre predictions of the repercussions of global warming.Trump has dismissed climate change as a hoax, and on Tuesday tweeted: “What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you!”The administration has scrubbed references to climate science from government websites, but Coats’s report presented it as a major threat.“Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security,” Coats warned.",Intelligence chief contradicts Trump on North Korea and Iran,2019-01-29/19:03:37+0000,the head of us intelligence has said that north korea is unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons because its leadership sees them as critical to regime survival in comments which contrasted sharply with donald trump s own assessment daniel coats the director of national intelligence made his assessment in a written statement on worldwide threats to the senate on tuesday which was noteworthy for the many ways it differed from the rhetoric favoured by the president and his top aides the gaps were not only evident on north korea but also on iran s nuclear programme the continuing threat of the islamic state in syria and on the importance of climate change the distance between the white house and its intelligence agencies was highlighted further in verbal testimony to the senate intelligence committee by coats alongside the heads of the cia dia and nsa who also testified coats s assessment on north korean intentions had particular impact as it comes in the run up to a planned second summit at the end of february between trump and kim jong un trump has rejected repeated reports that while the pyongyang regime has halted nuclear and missile tests since the first summit in singapore last june it has not paused its production of nuclear weapons and may have stepped it up the media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with north korea trump complained in a tweet last week the secretary of state mike pompeo has insisted that the diplomatic effort was aimed at complete north korean disarmament in his written testimony however coats said we continue to assess that north korea is unlikely to give up all of its nuclear weapons and production capabilities even as it seeks to negotiate partial denuclearization steps to obtain key us and international concessions north korean leaders view nuclear arms as critical to regime survival coats argued he went on to point out that kim jong un s pledge in singapore to pursue the complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula which trump and pompeo portrayed as a historic breakthrough was no more than a formulation linked to past demands that include an end to us military deployments and exercises involving advanced us capabilities that assessment of north korea was echoed by the head of the defence intelligence agency lt gen robert ashley he told the senate committee the capability and threat that existed a year ago are still there in contrast coats said that us intelligence continue to assess that iran is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons development activities we judge necessary to produce a nuclear device he noted that iran s activities are limited by the  multilateral nuclear deal the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa but as iran derives ever fewer benefits from the deal hardliners are pressing for the state to break free of those constraints trump abrogated the jcpoa in may last year and his administration has threatened sanctions against anyone doing business with iran pompeo and the national security adviser john bolton have described iran as the biggest terrorist threat in the world but the intelligence community s worldwide threats assessment does not echo that view it lists iran below isis and al qaida and homegrown extremists the intelligence report also represented a rejoinder to trump s claims of victory over isis in syria coats s written testimony said isis still commands thousands of fighters in iraq and syria and it maintains eight branches more than a dozen networks and thousands of dispersed supporters around the world despite significant leadership and territorial losses on a day that trump ridiculed concern about climate change because of the current blast of arctic weather in the midwest the intelligence report also includes sombre predictions of the repercussions of global warming trump has dismissed climate change as a hoax and on tuesday tweeted what the hell is going on with global waming please come back fast we need you the administration has scrubbed references to climate science from government websites but coats s report presented it as a major threat climate hazards such as extreme weather higher temperatures droughts floods wildfires storms sea level rise soil degradation and acidifying oceans are intensifying threatening infrastructure health and water and food security coats warned ,Iran Sanctions,0.225511014
"The Trump administration has tightened the screws on Venezuela’s embattled president, Nicolás Maduro, announcing sanctions against the country’s state-owned oil company PDVSA in what the US national security adviser admitted was partly an attempt to counter strategic threats from Cuba and Iran.At a briefing in the White House, the US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, told reporters the sanctions would help punish “those responsible for Venezuela’s tragic decline” and boost Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader who last week declared himself Venezuela’s rightful interim president and was recognized by the United States.“It is a complete tragedy to have a humanitarian crisis in a country that has very rich resources,” Mnuchin said.The sanctions – which represent the US’s toughest economic move against Maduro to date – come five days after Guaidó’s dramatic declaration sparked Venezuela’s latest political crisis.The national security adviser, John Bolton, said $7bn of PDVSA assets would be immediately blocked as a result of the sanctions while the company would also lose an estimated $11bn in export proceeds over the coming year.Bolton said the sanctions were an attempt to alleviate “the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis” currently gripping the South American nation and stop “Maduro and his cronies” looting the assets of the Venezuelan people.“Now is the time to stand for democracy and prosperity in Venezuela,” he said, calling on “all responsible nations” to back Guaidó. However, Bolton also conceded US strategic interests were in play, including concerns about the presence and activities of US foes in the region.“We think stability and democracy in Venezuela are in the direct national interests of the United States right now,” Bolton told reporters. “The authoritarian regime of Chávez and Maduro has allowed the penetration by adversaries of the United States, not least of which is Cuba.”He added: “Some call the country ‘Cubazuela’, reflecting the grip that Cuba’s military and security forces have on the Maduro regime. We think that is a strategic significant threat to the United States and there are others as well, including Iran’s interest in Venezuela’s uranium deposits.”Maduro hit back in a live broadcast to the nation from the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas.“This group of extremists that have stormed the White House have no limits,” he said, attacking the “belittlement, disdain and aggression” with which he claimed “Donald Trump’s unfit government” treated Venezuela.Amir Richani, a Latin America analyst at ClipperData, which tracks energy shipments, said the sanctions were intended “to continue the asphyxiation of Maduro’s government” and would come as a major blow.The US is the biggest importer of Venezuelan crude, followed by India and China, last year importing an average of around 500,000 barrels a day.Richani said the sanctions indicated the White House had decided to go “all-out” against Maduro: “This is a really dangerous situation for Caracas.”The notepad Bolton was holding as he took to the stage hinted at just how potentially dangerous it could be. A handwritten note on its yellow pages appeared to read: “5,000 troops to Colombia”.I hold Donald Trump responsible for any violence that might come to pass in VenezuelaAsked if there was any possibility of US troops getting involved in the Venezuelan crisis, Bolton replied: “Look, the president has made it very clear on this matter that all option are on the table.” Any violence against Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition or US diplomatic staff “would be met by a significant response”.In his televised broadcast Maduro accused Bolton and Trump of seeking to destroy his leftist “Bolivarian” administration through a coup that risked plunging Venezuela into conflict.“I hold Donald Trump responsible for any violence that might come to pass in Venezuela. It will be you, señor presidente Donald Trump, responsible for this policy of regime change in Venezuela, and the blood that might flow in Venezuela will be on your hands … You will have your hands covered in blood, if you lead Venezuela into partial or generalised violence.”Earlier on Monday, Pope Francis said he feared bloodshed.Speaking on the papal plane as he returned from a five-day visit to Panama, the pope told reporters: “In this moment, I support all the Venezuelan people because they are a people who are suffering.“I suffer for what is happening in Venezuela. What is it that scares me? Bloodshed.”The Republican senator Marco Rubio celebrated the fresh sanctions, tweeting: “All property & interests of PdVSA are now blocked and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.”Rubio, thought to have been a major influence in Trump’s decision to recognize Guaidó, added: “Venezuela’s oil belongs to the Venezuelan people and the money for oil will now go to them through the legitimate government of Guaido.”In a second tweet, Rubio posted a photograph of Maduro and wrote: “All bad things must also come to an end.”In the latest sign of coordination between Guaidó and the White House, Guaidó also announced on Monday plans to name a new board for PDVSA and its US refining subsidiary, Citgo. The move would help kickstart the recovery of an industry “that today is living through a dark moment,” Guaidó tweeted.",Trump steps up Maduro pressure with sanctions on Venezuelan oil

"European objections have forced the United States to backtrack on plans to stage a two-day conference in Poland focused on building a global coalition against Iran.The conference is now being described as a wider brainstorming session about the Middle East.In announcing the summit earlier this month, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, had explicitly said the summit’s purpose was to focus on Iran’s influence and terrorism in the region.But the joint official announcement of the summit did not mention Iran, instead highlighting issues connected with Iran – “terrorism and extremism, missile development and proliferation, maritime trade and security, and threats posed by proxy groups across the region”.The change of emphasis follows signs that many European countries, including the EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, will avoid the two-day event on 12 and 13 February, and instead head to the Munich security forum later in the week.The US has been trying to persuade the EU to drop its support for the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and has been using the threat of US secondary sanctions to press EU firms not to trade with Iran.The UK is one of the countries most conflicted about attending the Polish conference since the UK is traditionally close to both Poland and the US, but has stood by the Iran nuclear deal.The broadening of the agenda may be designed to make it easier for the UK to attend. Jonathan Cohen, US representative at the UN, described the scope of the discussion as “much broader than any one country or set of issues”. He said it would be a “global brainstorming session” and stressed that it was “not the venue to demonise or attack Iran.”Issues such as the humanitarian crises in Syria and Yemen, missile development and cyber security would be discussed, Cohen told the UN security council.The Polish envoy to the UN, Joanna Wronecka, also said the ministerial conference in Warsaw would bring “added value to the efforts to peace in the Middle East by creating a positive vision to the region”.

did not mention iran instead highlighting issues connected with iran terrorism and extremism missile development and proliferation maritime trade and security and threats posed by proxy groups across the region the change of emphasis follows signs that many european countries including the eu foreign affairs chief federica mogherini will avoid the two day event on  and  february and instead head to the munich security forum later in the week the us has been trying to persuade the eu to drop its support for the  iran nuclear deal and has been using the threat of us secondary sanctions to press

"Saudi Arabia should hold to account “every single person” responsible for killing the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Mike Pompeo has said in Riyadh.The US secretary of state refused to be drawn on whether that included his Saudi host, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom the CIA has said probably ordered the murder last October.Pompeo said on Monday he had discussed Khashoggi’s death with the Saudi heir and his father, King Salman, and raised the fate of jailed women’s rights activists. Both issues have buffeted bilateral ties in the three months since the Washington Post columnist was killed. His death left the US scrambling to provide cover for the kingdom, which had been a bedrock of its foreign policy throughout Donald Trump’s first two years in office.Pompeo’s nine-country tour of the Middle East had been designed to reassure allies of the Trump administration’s commitment to the region in the aftermath of Khashoggi’s death and the furore surrounding the president’s surprise decision to withdraw from Syria.He had earlier spoken of the US being a regional “force for good” and of his visit marking a “real new beginning” in US policy – a swipe at Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, whose 2009 address in Cairo, where Pompeo spoke on Thursday, had set the tone for his administration’s regional stance.“We spoke about human rights issues here in Saudi Arabia, women activists,” Pompeo said. “We spoke about the accountability and the expectations that we have. The Saudis are friends and when friends have conversations you tell them what your expectations are. Every single person who has responsibility for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi needs to be held accountable.”Pompeo’s tour had taken him to countries increasingly wary of the Trump administration’s stance towards the region, and uncertain about how to deal with a president many felt to be capricious and unwilling to engage outside a narrow band of interests – a significant change from previous Republican leaders, particularly George W Bush, who had tried to impose US values through war and occupation.Considered to be one of the last “grownups” to have Trump’s ear, Pompeo’s credentials as an Iran hawk are well established. But his readiness to take on Tehran surprised some regional officials, as did his insistence that the US could do so while at the same time withdrawing its ground forces from the border with Iraq and Syria.As the remnants of Islamic State melt back into the Iraqi deserts, Iran is consolidating areas over which it took control during the almost completed US-led rout of the terror group. US-raised proxies in Syria’s north-east, primarily Kurdish groups, are feeling increasingly exposed as the withdrawal begins.Many Kurdish leaders believe their interests are being sold out to the US’s Nato ally Turkey, which has threatened to invade the region, with the aim of pushing away Kurdish militants from its border.Trump muddied the waters further on Sunday when he tweeted that Turkey would face economic consequences if it attacked Kurdish fighters in Syria.While insisting he has impressed Trump’s commitment to the Middle East on allies, another underlying message – that the US stands by its friends – is gaining less traction in regional halls of power, where the Kurdish example is being viewed as a precedent.Equally confusing to some Gulf allies is how an ever-more belligerent US posture towards Tehran can be credible when Washington’s military muscle is being called home. Pompeo has emphasised that the US has other ways of bringing Tehran to its knees, primarily through sanctions that could slow its capacity to make money in Syria, Iraq and Turkey, which are partly dependent on Tehran for energy needs.Trump’s global mantra, of demanding allies share the burden of US defence spending, is being acted out in real terms in the region, and this was another centrepiece of the Pompeo sell.In the past two years, Saudi Arabia has spearheaded a stagnating war in Yemen, Israel has struck Iranian targets inside Syria more than 2,000 times, and Turkey is in effect being delegated with mopping up Isis along the Euphrates River valley.In staking his claim in Cairo, Pompeo emphasised that he identified as an evangelical Christian, and as a Christian Zionist. A large part of Trump’s domestic constituency invokes an apocalyptic showdown with a pre-ordained foe, who many followers believe to be Iran, in Israel’s northern plains that will be brought on when the world’s Jews gather in Israel.Under Trump, such beliefs have a very real application and policy implications. Pompeo’s words and the US president’s actions have told regional leaders that there would be little talk of human rights, governance, or corruption; as long as there is common cause against Iran, autocracy is back in vogue.As Pompeo flies back to Washington from Oman on Monday night – his last stop in Kuwait was cancelled so he could attend a family funeral – the impression he leaves is mixed. On one hand, the pre-Obama US is back; Iran is the primary foe, and Washington’s regional projection is again centred on protecting Israel. On the other, things are far less certain. While Pompeo has staked a purpose and gladhanded friends, some allies fear a volatile president’s “everyone for himself” mantra means the US may no longer have their back when it counts.",Pompeo:

"The White House asked the Pentagon to draw up options for military strikes against Iran in the wake of two incidents in Iraq last September when mortar shells and rockets fired by militias exploded near US diplomatic facilities, it was reported on Sunday.Contingency planning for potential conflicts is routine, but according to the Wall Street Journal, the seriousness of the request from the National Security Council unnerved defense and state officials.“It definitely rattled people,” a former senior US administration official was quoted as saying. “People were shocked. It was mind-boggling how cavalier they were about hitting Iran.”A direct US attack on Iran would be risk triggering a conflict between the two nations that would be hard to stop. There are already hardliners in both camps calling for military confrontation.The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, declined to comment on the report on Sunday, when questioned by reporters on his nine-nation tour of the Middle East, which is aimed in large part at maintaining Arab solidarity against Iran. On Sunday he flew from Qatar to Saudi Arabia, where he is due to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.In Qatar, Pompeo provided details of a planned anti-Iran ministerial conference to be held, at US prompting, in Warsaw in February.“There’ll be a broad coalition of countries present,” he said, “and we’ll work on many issues, including how it is we can get the Islamic Republic of Iran to behave more like a normal nation.”Since John Bolton, the former US ambassador to the United Nations, became national security adviser in April last year, he has joined with Pompeo in pushing for a much more aggressive posture towards Tehran. Bolton, who wrote a New York Times commentary in 2015 calling for Iran to be bombed, warned that Tehran would have “hell to pay” if it threatened the US or its allies.That warning came after a Shia militia fired three mortar shells on 6 September into the diplomatic district of Baghdad, where the US has its embassy. A few days later, missiles fired by unknown militants fell near the US consulate in the southern Iraqi city of Basra.Although there were no casualties or significant damage in either incident, they raised alarm in Washington that US diplomats could be vulnerable.“We have told the Islamic Republic of Iran that using a proxy force to attack an American interest will not prevent us from responding against the prime actor,” Pompeo told CNN at the time, making clear a military response was possible.Later on Sunday, Axios reported that James Mattis, the then defense secretary, had “deep concerns” about the White House request at the time, believing that it risked creating a direct conflict with Iran.Last year, Donald Trump pulled the US out of a multilateral 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. He has ordered a campaign of intense sanctions against the Islamic Republic. But he also reassured European leaders that he did not want to be drawn into a new Middle Eastern conflict, and that he would rein in Bolton.The president’s order for US troops to withdraw from Syria, where they were near Iranian troops and Iranian-backed militias, marked a defeat for Iran hawks in his administration. But with hardliners in positions of influence on both sides, the potential for an unplanned clash remains high, particularly in the crowded sea lanes of the Gulf or in Iraq.The tough talk from Bolton and Pompeo has added to concerns that Baghdad could again become a proxy battleground between the US and Iranian interests, much as it was during the height of the sectarian chaos, when a full-blown proxy war played out across the country.Throughout much of the US military presence in Iraq, the giant US embassy in the Iraqi capital’s fortified Green Zone was a target for Shia militias, which regularly rained in rockets and mortars from as far as seven miles away.Two of the main protagonists from 2007 to 2011, Asa’ib ahl al-Haq and Kataib Hezbollah, both proxies of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps, have gained strength in Baghdad in the past four years, and exert considerable influence across political and security spheres.Conflict could also be triggered if Iran decides to abandon the 2015 nuclear deal. The US abrogation of the agreement means Tehran is receiving few of the economic benefits it was promised.On Sunday, the head of the country’s nuclear programme, Ali Akbar Salehi, said technicians had begun “preliminary activities for designing” a new way of producing 20%-enriched uranium. If production was resumed, it would violate the 2015 agreement, which still exists with other world powers despite the US pulling out, and would escalate tensions with Israel, the Gulf states and the US.The National Iranian American Council (NIAC), a pro-diplomacy advocacy group, issued a statement on the Wall Street Journal report, saying: “This administration takes an expansive view of war authorities and is leaning into confrontation with Iran at a time when there are numerous tripwires for conflict across the region.”",White House asked the Pentagon for plans to strike Iran –

"The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has vowed the US and its allies will “expel every last Iranian boot” from Syria as he sought to reassure Middle Eastern nations it was not withdrawing from the region despite Donald Trump’s call for troops to return home.In a keynote speech delivered in Cairo, pitched as the centrepiece of his nine-country regional tour, Pompeo called for a common stand against Tehran. “It’s time for old rivalries to end, for the sake of the greater good of the region,” he said.The US would “use diplomacy and work with our partners to expel every last Iranian boot” from Syria and bolster efforts “to bring peace and stability to the long-suffering Syrian people”, he said.The US’s most senior diplomat also delivered a rebuke to Barack Obama, whose address from the Egyptian capital a decade ago set the course for his government’s outreach to Iran and disavowal of George W Bush’s intervention in Iraq.Pompeo claimed the US under Obama had been timid about asserting itself, “when the times – and our partners – demanded it”, and had emboldened Iran to entrench its influence across the region.He committed to ongoing airstrikes against Isis but did not directly address Trump’s decision to withdraw 2,000 US ground forces from eastern Syria.Pompeo and the US national security adviser, John Bolton, have attempted to walk back Trump’s December announcement and observers considered the announcement of continuing US airstrikes to be a further move to reassure allies, particularly Kurdish proxies, that they would not be abandoned.In remarks aimed at Obama’s support for the Iran nuclear deal, but which could also be applied to the withdrawal from Syria, Pompeo said: “When America retreats, chaos follows. When we neglect our friends, resentment builds. When we partner with enemies, they advance.”Casting Iran as a “cancerous influence”, Pompeo said the US had “reimposed sanctions that should never have been lifted”.“We embarked on a new pressure campaign to cut off the revenues the regime uses to spread terror and destruction,” he said.Consolidating traditional US relationships in the Middle East has been central to Trump’s regional strategy, as has bedrock support for Israel and attempts to align Arab allies with Jerusalem, particularly on Iran. Identifying as an evangelical Christian, Pompeo lauded the UAE’s recognition of Israel at a judo competition late last year, a move he said had been two years in the making.Pompeo spent little time on human rights or governance – touchstone issues for previous leaders. He did thank the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, for a recent court decision to acquit US citizens who had been convicted of improperly operating NGOs.Nancy Okail, the executive director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, was one of the 41 people acquitted in the case. She said while Pompeo’s acknowledgment of the case was important, “it is also necessary to recognise that prominent Egyptian civil society members are still being prosecuted under the same case. Thirty of them are banned from travelling, along with having their assets frozen. This case must be fully closed and civil society should be allowed to perform their crucial role freely.”Pompeo’s address was largely in line with previous speeches from Trump, the most significant of which he gave in Riyadh nearly two years ago on his first trip abroad as president. The administration’s mantra has been to assist rather than lead, and Pompeo claimed the US had falsely considered itself a “force for what ails the Middle East”.“We have rediscovered our voice. We have rebuilt our relationships. We have rejected false overtures from enemies,” he said. “In just 24 months, the United States under President Trump has reasserted its traditional role as a force for good in this region, because we’ve learned from our mistakes.”Rob Malley, a former senior official in the Obama administration, said: “Listening to Secretary Pompeo’s speech is like listening to someone from a parallel universe – in which the war in Iraq or Abu Ghraib, US indifference to its allies’ human rights violations, or Washington’s own complicity in the humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen never occurred.“Back on planet Earth, they will see it for what it is: a self-congratulatory, delusional depiction of the Trump administration’s Middle East policy.”","US will expel every last Iranian boot from Syria, says Mike

"Iran has been accused by the Dutch government of directing two political assassinations in the Netherlands, triggering EU sanctions against Tehran’s military intelligence service.The two murders are alleged to have taken place in broad daylight in 2015 in Almere, a city east of Amsterdam, and in 2017 on a street close to the Dutch foreign ministry in The Hague.In a written statement to the Dutch parliament, Stef Blok, the country’s foreign minister, said intelligence services had found “strong indications that Iran was involved in the assassinations of two Dutch nationals of Iranian origin”.Blok added the government believed such “hostile actions” violated Dutch sovereignty.The man killed in 2015 was named as Mohammad Reza Kolahi Samadi, 56, who had previously been sentenced to death in Iran after being accused of planting a bomb at the Islamic Republic party’s headquarters in 1981, killing 73 people.Among those killed in the bomb attack was the second-in-command to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran’s supreme leader. Samadi, who had been in the building shortly before the explosion, was accused of the attack and fled to Europe. He was sentenced to death in absentia.With his wife and teenage son, he had lived in Almere, working as an engineer under the alias Ali Motamed. He was shot in the head at point-blank range by two assailants dressed in black, in what was claimed to have the hallmarks of a contract killing.Two years later, the Iranian activist Ahmad Molla Nissi, 52, who founded an Arab nationalist group seeking an independent state inside Iran, was also shot in the head as he walked through The Hague.On Tuesday, the EU imposed sanctions against two Iranians and the country’s military intelligence service in response to the allegations.The Dutch government said the expulsion in June 2018 of two diplomats from the Iranian embassy in the Netherlands had been in retaliation for the murders and the Iranian ambassador had been summoned at the time.Dick Schoof, the director general of the Dutch security service, the AIVD, said it was involved in “intense” efforts with other countries to research the extent of Iranian “interference” in Europe. Last year, France and Denmark also accused Iran of plotting attacks on European soil, involving a foiled bombing attack that targeted a rally organised by an Iranian opposition group near Paris in June 2018 and the assassination of the exiled leader of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA), a separatist group with a history of carrying out attacks in Iran.The development has thrown EU-Iran relations into crisis at a time when Brussels is straining to keep alive the accord under which sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for it lowering its nuclear ambitions.

"Iran is digging its own diplomatic grave by punishing the jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after it cut both her food rations and access to medical treatment for a lump on her breast, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has said.The family of the 40-year-old, who has been detained in Iran since 2016, said last week that she intended to begin a hunger strike on Monday 14 January alongside her fellow inmate and human rights activist Narges Mohammadi.The two women have been requesting medical treatment promised to them by a prison doctor, but denied by the Iranian prison authorities.Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s weekly Sunday phonecall with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has since been cut as well as her medical rations.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is an Iranian-British dual national who has been jailed in Iran since April 2016. She has been accused of attempting to orchestrate a “soft overthrow” of the Islamic Republic. She and her three-year-old daughter, Gabriella, were about to return to the UK from Iran after a family visit when she was arrested. Since then, she has spent most of her time in Evin prison in Tehran, separated from her daughter.In January 2019 she went on hunger strike for three days in protest against being denied medical care in Tehran’s Evin prison. In March, the UK Foreign Office granted her diplomatic protection, a step that raised her case from a consular matter to the level of a dispute between the two states.Zaghari-Ratcliffe worked for BBC Media Action between February 2009 and October 2010 before moving to Thomson Reuters Foundation, the news agency’s charitable arm, as a project manager. Her family has always said that she was in Iran on holiday. Alistair Burt, the Middle East minister, who was speaking in the Commons on Monday, insisted her access to medicines was of “supreme importance” to the UK, and said pressure was being applied on the Iranian government to allow British officials consular access to her in prison. He said Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release may change perceptions of Iran.Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s MP, Tulip Siddiq, said her treatment was “becoming a matter of life and death”, and called on the foreign ministry to summon the Iranian ambassador to the UK and to demand the issue was debated at the UN security council. “Tough rhetoric is not enough”, said Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead.Thornberry, in some of her most pointed remarks to the Iranian government, described the mistreatment of Zaghari-Ratcliffe as “a cruel and vengeful response”. She said the mistreatment of any prisoner was inhumane, but said in the context of her medical and physical condition, “her treatment is nothing but barbaric”.She added: “it was necessary for the Iranians to restore not just her basic rights, but her freedom without delay.”Iran faced a twin economic and military threat this year, Thornberry noted, from the US economic sanctions and dangerous military escalation. She said: “Iran will need us to fight on their behalf to preserve the nuclear deal, to preserve trade and stop the descent into war. Tehran needs to hear this. Every day Nazanin’s inhumane treatment continues, every time we see fresh human rights abuses in Iran, it makes it more and more difficult to summon the stomach for that fight.“When the Foreign Office says Iran is holding Nazanin for diplomatic advantage, Tehran needs to realise that in fact, the opposite is true. For her every day they continue her unjust detention, they are simply burying their own diplomatic grave.”The Zaghari-Ratcliffe campaign said: “[Nazanin] hasn’t started her hunger strike yet. She and Narges Mohammedi announced last week that they will go on hunger strike next Monday unless they are given the medical treatment promised by the prison doctor, but blocked by the prison authorities.“But [we have had] no formal response yet on whether she will be allowed the recommended treatment, so are waiting to see what happens over the next couple of days.”The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has been in contact with the family 11 times since August, and made her plight a highlight of his one-day visit to Tehran.The Iranian news agency Fars reported on Sunday that the Iranian judicial spokesman, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, criticised Hunt for threatening Iran over Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case.He said: “Firstly, he has done a damn wrong move to threaten [Iran]. Secondly, releasing or keeping Zaghari [in jail] is no way affected by their interference.” The foreign ministry has accused Hunt of hasty and incorrect remarks, insisting she had been found guilty of espionage and sentenced to five years in jail.","Iran digging 'diplomatic grave' over Zaghari-Ratcliffe, says Thornberry",2019-01-07/18:59:23+0000,iran is digging its own diplomatic grave by punishing the jailed british iranian woman nazanin zaghari ratcliffe after it cut both her food rations and access to medical treatment for a lump on her breast the shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry has said the family of the  year old who has been detained in iran since  said last week that she intended to begin a hunger strike on monday  january alongside her fellow inmate and human rights activist narges mohammadi the two women have been requesting medical treatment promised to them by a prison doctor but denied by the iranian prison authorities zaghari ratcliffe s weekly sunday phonecall with her husband richard ratcliffe has since been cut as well as her medical rations nazanin zaghari ratcliffe is an iranian british dual national who has been jailed in iran since april  she has been accused of attempting to orchestrate a soft overthrow of the islamic republic she and her three year old daughter gabriella were about to return to the uk from iran after a family visit when she was arrested since then she has spent most of her time in evin prison in tehran separated from her daughter in january  she went on hunger strike for three days in protest against being denied medical care in tehran s evin prison in march the uk foreign office granted her diplomatic protection a step that raised her case from a consular matter to the level of a dispute between the two states zaghari ratcliffe worked for bbc media action between february  and october  before moving to thomson  foundation the news agency s charitable arm as a project manager her family has always said that she was in iran on holiday alistair burt the middle east minister who was speaking in the commons on monday insisted her access to medicines was of supreme importance to the uk and said pressure was being applied on the iranian government to allow british officials consular access to her in prison he said zaghari ratcliffe s release may change perceptions of iran zaghari ratcliffe s mp tulip siddiq said her treatment was becoming a matter of life and death and called on the foreign ministry to summon the iranian ambassador to the uk and to demand the issue was debated at the un security council tough rhetoric is not enough said siddiq the labour mp for hampstead thornberry in some of her most pointed remarks to the iranian government described the mistreatment of zaghari ratcliffe as a cruel and vengeful response she said the mistreatment of any prisoner was inhumane but said in the context of her medical and physical condition her treatment is nothing but barbaric she added it was necessary for the iranians to restore not just her basic rights but her freedom without delay iran faced a twin economic and military threat this year thornberry noted from the us economic sanctions and dangerous military escalation she said iran will need us to fight on their behalf to preserve the nuclear deal to preserve trade and stop the descent into war tehran needs to hear this every day nazanin s inhumane treatment continues every time we see fresh human rights abuses in iran it makes it more and more difficult to summon the stomach for that fight when the foreign office says iran is holding nazanin for diplomatic advantage tehran needs to realise that in fact the opposite is true for her every day they continue her unjust detention they are simply burying their own diplomatic grave the zaghari ratcliffe campaign said nazanin hasn t started her hunger strike yet she and narges mohammedi announced last week that they will go on hunger strike next monday unless they are given the medical treatment promised by the prison doctor but blocked by the prison authorities but we have had no formal response yet on whether she will be allowed the recommended treatment so are waiting to see what happens over the next couple of days the foreign secretary jeremy hunt has been in contact with the family  times since august and made her plight a highlight of his one day visit to tehran the iranian news agency fars reported on sunday that the iranian judicial spokesman gholam hossein mohseni ejei criticised hunt for threatening iran over zaghari ratcliffe s case he said firstly he has done a damn wrong move to threaten iran secondly releasing or keeping zaghari in jail is no way affected by their interference the foreign ministry has accused hunt of hasty and incorrect remarks insisting she had been found guilty of espionage and sentenced to five years in jail ,Iran Sanctions,0.202487454
"The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has admitted for the first time that Russian support for the Syrian regime means Bashar al-Assad will remain in power for some time.The UK has been at the forefront of calls for the Syrian president to leave office as part of a transition to a new government, but over the past year British diplomats have acknowledged that Assad would have to be allowed to stand in any UN-supervised democratic elections in Syria.In December Donald Trump announced that the remaining 2,000 US troops in Syria would imminently withdraw, leaving Assad in power and a large Iranian military presence intact within Syria.Many Arab states have also accepted that Assad has survived the seven-year civil war and are preparing to reopen embassies in Damascus.During a three-day trip to Asia, Hunt told Sky News: “I think you know the British longstanding position is that we won’t have lasting peace in Syria with that regime. But regretfully we do think he’s going to be around for a while and that is because of the support that he’s had from Russia.“Russia may think that it’s gained a sphere of influence. What we would say to them is: yes – and you’ve also gained a responsibility. If you’re going to be involved in Syria then you need to make sure that there really is peace in Syria. And that means making sure that President Assad does not use chemical weapons.”In April 2017 Hunt’s predecessor, Boris Johnson, described Assad as a monster that needed decapitating.Just before Christmas the UN acknowledged it had failed to persuade Russia to agree to form a sufficiently diverse body to prepare a constitution and elections in Syria.This means UN-supervised elections are delayed indefinitely. The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, has resigned.The British acknowledgement of Assad’s continued grip on power underlines doubts that Syrian military leaders will ever be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons in the civil war.The UK was instrumental in giving the OPCW, the chemical weapons watchdog in The Hague, additional powers to investigate and attribute the use of chemical weapons in Syria.The UK has claimed Assad’s forces used chemical weapons most recently in Douma in April 2018, an attack that led to joint US, French and British airstrikes. The OPCW has yet to give a formal final verdict on whether Assad’s forces used chemical weapons.Hunt’s remarks will raise questions about whether European powers will be willing to lift sanctions against Assad or end a moratorium on providing the country with reconstruction aid. The EU has said it will not provide Syria with reconstruction aid until it has assurances that democratic elections will be held.In Washington, after an outcry over the withdrawal announcement and the resignation of the defence secretary, Jim Mattis, Trump has said he will not allow US troops to leave in a way that endangers the Kurdish forces that have been at the heart of the fight against Islamic State in Northern Syria.The US had previously set preconditions on a US troop withdrawal including the departure of Iranian militias, but at a briefing on Wednesday Trump said Iran could “do what they want there, frankly,” remarks that left Israel politicians aghast.Convinced that Isis has been defeated, Trump dismissed the continuing value of Syria to the US, saying: “We are talking about sand and death. We are not talking about vast wealth.”The UK privately opposed Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria on the basis that Isis is far from defeated There are also concerns that the Kurds abandoned by the west will release Isis fighters under their guard.Hunt said he wanted the fate of two British Isis fighters, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, to be settled. The two men, who have been stripped of their British citizenship, are being held by Syrian Kurdish forces.","Assad will remain in power 'for a while', says Jeremy Hunt",2019-01-03/14:45:18+0000,the british foreign secretary jeremy hunt has admitted for the first time that russian support for the syrian regime means bashar al assad will remain in power for some time the uk has been at the forefront of calls for the syrian president to leave office as part of a transition to a new government but over the past year british diplomats have acknowledged that assad would have to be allowed to stand in any un supervised democratic elections in syria in december donald trump announced that the remaining   us troops in syria would imminently withdraw leaving assad in power and a large iranian military presence intact within syria many arab states have also accepted that assad has survived the seven year civil war and are preparing to reopen embassies in damascus during a three day trip to asia hunt told sky news i think you know the british longstanding position is that we won t have lasting peace in syria with that regime but regretfully we do think he s going to be around for a while and that is because of the support that he s had from russia russia may think that it s gained a sphere of influence what we would say to them is yes and you ve also gained a responsibility if you re going to be involved in syria then you need to make sure that there really is peace in syria and that means making sure that president assad does not use chemical weapons in april  hunt s predecessor boris johnson described assad as a monster that needed decapitating just before christmas the un acknowledged it had failed to persuade russia to agree to form a sufficiently diverse body to prepare a constitution and elections in syria this means un supervised elections are delayed indefinitely the un special envoy for syria staffan de mistura has resigned the british acknowledgement of assad s continued grip on power underlines doubts that syrian military leaders will ever be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons in the civil war the uk was instrumental in giving the opcw the chemical weapons watchdog in the hague additional powers to investigate and attribute the use of chemical weapons in syria the uk has claimed assad s forces used chemical weapons most recently in douma in april  an attack that led to joint us french and british airstrikes the opcw has yet to give a formal final verdict on whether assad s forces used chemical weapons hunt s remarks will raise questions about whether european powers will be willing to lift sanctions against assad or end a moratorium on providing the country with reconstruction aid the eu has said it will not provide syria with reconstruction aid until it has assurances that democratic elections will be held in washington after an outcry over the withdrawal announcement and the resignation of the defence secretary jim mattis trump has said he will not allow us troops to leave in a way that endangers the kurdish forces that have been at the heart of the fight against islamic state in northern syria the us had previously set preconditions on a us troop withdrawal including the departure of iranian militias but at a briefing on wednesday trump said iran could do what they want there frankly remarks that left israel politicians aghast convinced that isis has been defeated trump dismissed the continuing value of syria to the us saying we are talking about sand and death we are not talking about vast wealth the uk privately opposed trump s decision to withdraw us troops from syria on the basis that isis is far from defeated there are also concerns that the kurds abandoned by the west will release isis fighters under their guard hunt said he wanted the fate of two british isis fighters alexanda kotey and el shafee elsheikh to be settled the two men who have been stripped of their british citizenship are being held by syrian kurdish forces ,Iran Sanctions,0.337744087
"Like a furious maelstrom, roiled by opposing currents, the crisis in the Gulf gains in intensity and destructive power almost by the day. On Sunday, Donald Trump said the US was “locked and loaded”, ready to respond to attacks on an oil facility in Saudi Arabia, in which it believes Iran was involved. But warning bells, akin to those used to alert fog-bound mariners steering towards rocks, have been ringing out for months. They have mostly been ignored. The daunting bill for multiple acts of political insouciance, measured in lives and petrodollars, is now coming due.Trump is even trying to sell the Saudis nuclear technology. What would you think, were you in Iran’s shoes?It’s easy and convenient to solely blame Iran, as American and British officials routinely do without conclusive evidence. Rather, it is serial western and regional miscalculations that have drawn us ineluctably into this dread vortex.How can disaster be averted? Who can stop a slide into a wider war that could swiftly engulf regional states from Israel to Saudi Arabia, and drag in US, British and maybe even Russian forces? Clues can be found in the mistakes that led to this point. Answers, if they exist, will only come through informed statesmanship of the sort signally lacking so far.Mention of which brings us, first, to Trump and Iran. Tehran’s regime has been viewed as a threat by the US since the 1979 revolution. But it was Trump, with his unrivalled ability to make bad situations worse, who ripped up the Iran nuclear deal on 8 May last year, imposed punitive economic sanctions, and sparked the immediate crisis. His enmity has hurt Iran’s citizens – but not the regime.In erring so idiotically, Trump preferred the advice of his discredited former national security adviser, John Bolton, over the personal pleadings of Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. He also gave short shrift to his chum Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, who made a last-minute dash to Washington. A damaging rift with Europe over Iran began that day.Iran’s fractious, fractured leadership rallied, improbably unified by Trump. Military and clerical hardliners are now taking the fight – a fight, as they see it, against regime change by the US – to their enemies, principally the Saudis and Israelis.Old geopolitical faultlines were recklessly aggravated and inflamed. Any sensible policy would seek to balance the regional claims of Shia Muslim Iran and the Sunni house of Saud. But the west – turning a blind eye for decades to pitiless autocracy, legalised misogyny and religious bigotry – has continued to court Riyadh and its corrupting riches.Here again Trump jumped in, making shockwaves. Not content to cement the Saudi alliance during his first overseas visit as president, Trump made crown prince Mohammed bin Salman his new best friend. When the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents, Trump turned defence attorney. He is even trying to sell Salman nuclear technology. What would you think, were you in Iran’s shoes?The failure of US and British leaders, among others, to halt Salman’s disastrous war of choice in Yemen marked another stage in this downward spiral. Ignoring war crimes and what the UN calls a worst-in-the-world humanitarian catastrophe, they continue to peddle arms, advice and diplomatic cover for Riyadh.When the Yemen civil war began in 2015, there was scant evidence of active Iranian military support for the Houthi rebels. Yet now, reacting opportunistically to US attrition, Tehran’s Revolutionary Guards are apparently supplying – directly or indirectly – the drones, missiles and limpet mines used to attack Saudi oil fields, airfields and tankers.What a result. Let’s presume to question the US’s chief diplomat, Mike Pompeo, about this extraordinary own goal. Hey, Mike, how do you turn a disagreement into a war? His answer: punch your opponent into a corner from which he cannot escape. What did Trump, Bolton and CIA director Gina Haspel think would happen when the US shredded the enrichment deal? What’s happening is that Iran is resuming the very activities that so alarm them.Or here’s a question for another well-known international statesman: Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Is Iran already seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, as you claim – or are your pressure tactics more or less guaranteeing that it will? If it does, then that, surely, will be in large part thanks to your endless sabre-rattling. How does this make Israel safer?This threat of general conflagration, whipped up by design or sheer incompetence, now overshadows the region as a whole. In the name of repulsing Iran, Israel is almost daily engaged in covert military operations against Tehran’s allies and proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria – where, shamefully, civil war still rages.It gets worse. Reports from Kuwait say the drones that hit the Saudi oil installations at the weekend overflew the country, suggesting they came from Shia militia bases in Iraq. In this developing regional war, Israel and the Saudis are, in effect, on the same side. Iraq’s government wants no part of it. But, thanks to the vacuum left by the US after the 2003-11 occupation, Tehran wields considerable influence in Baghdad.The very last thing Iraqis want is the Americans coming back, using their territory as a forward base in a wider Iranian siege. Yet Trump suggested exactly that last year. Can this scenario be ruled out? Not entirely. And so reason takes flight and the maelstrom builds. Urgently needed now are competent leaders who know how to calm a storm before all are sucked under.• Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",The world ignored the warning signs – and now the

"Donald Trump has said the US is “locked and loaded” and ready to respond to attacks on a petroleum processing facility in Saudi Arabia, as US officials said the evidence pointed to Iranian involvement. The US president did not mention Iran, but wrote on Twitter that he had “reason to believe that we know the culprit” behind the series of attacks on the Abqaiq facility, which is the world’s largest petroleum processing plant. The attacks disrupted more than half of the kingdom’s oil output and will affect global supplies.Trump tweeted: “[We] are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia] as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed!”It is the first time the president has hinted at a potential American military response.As tensions rose in the Gulf, Iran’s semi-official news agency ISNA reported that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had seized a vessel for allegedly smuggling 250,000 litres of diesel fuel to the United Arab Emirates. It follows a series of incidents involving shipping in and around the Gulf after US sanctions on Iranian oil exports took full effect in May.The US government has produced satellite photos showing what officials said were at least 19 points of impact on Saturday at two Saudi energy facilities, including damage at the heart of the kingdom’s crucial oil processing plant at Abqaiq. Officials told US media the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south. Iraq denied that its territory was used for an attack on the kingdom. US officials said a strike from there would be a violation of Iraq’s sovereignty.The US officials said additional devices, which apparently didn’t reach their targets, were recovered northwest of the facilities and are being jointly analysed by Saudi and American intelligence. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, did not address whether the weapons could have been fired from Yemen, then taken a round-about path, but did not explicitly rule it out.Oil prices rose in the wake of the attack to reach six-month highs on Monday, with gains of as much as 20%. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, gained almost $12 a barrel reaching up to $71.95 a barrel, before dropping back to $68 a barrel.The US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed over the weekend that Iran was responsible for the attack, which was claimed by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi rebel group. Pompeo said there was no evidence the weapons were launched in Yemen and accused Iran of “an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply”.Iran has denied allegations of responsibility. Its foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said of Pompeo’s comments that “such fruitless and blind accusations and remarks are incomprehensible and meaningless.”Iranian officials have also warned that US military assets in the region are within range of its missiles. “Having failed at ‘max pressure’, [Pompeo is] turning to ‘max deceit’,” the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, wrote on Twitter.As the diplomatic crisis deepened, Trump tweeted that reports he had been willing to meet with Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, before the attacks were false. “The Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, ‘No Conditions.’ That is an incorrect statement (as usual!),” he tweeted on Sunday.But political commentators were quick to point out that those comments came from Pompeo and treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, who five days ago said on camera that Trump was willing to meet with Rouhani with “no preconditions” at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in New York.Here’s video of Pompeo and Mnuchin saying what Trump just called “fake news” — that he would meet with Iran without conditions. In light of the bombing of Saudi oil facilities, Trump is pretending they didn’t say this and blaming the media.  pic.twitter.com/PX9gbwLBiZOn Monday Mousavi said no plans had been made for Trump and Rouhani to meet.Over the weekend a senior commander from Iran’s Revolutionary Guards warned that the Islamic republic was ready for “full-fledged” war.“Everybody should know that all American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000km around Iran are within the range of our missiles,” the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps’ aerospace force, Amirali Hajizadeh, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.Saudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said the kingdom was “willing and able” to respond to this “terrorist aggression.”Inflamed fears about Middle East tensions and worsening relations between Iran and the United States, powered safe-haven assets, with gold up 1% to $1,503.4 per ounce.“The bigger issue is what premium markets will build in to reflect the risk of further attacks,” said Kerry Craig, a strategist JP Morgan.“In the very near-term, we may also see a pick-up in safe-havens. Central banks are likely to look through the inflationary impact of higher oil prices but the added geopolitical risk to an already fragile backdrop will not go without notice.”Saudi Arabia’s oilfields and pipelines have been targeted by rebels over the past year but never on such a scale and causing such disruption. Analysts warned that global supplies of oil are likely to suffer a “major jolt” following the attack.

officials said the evidence pointed to iranian involvement the us president did not mention iran but wrote on twitter that he had reason to believe that we know the culprit behind the series of attacks on the abqaiq facility which is the world s largest petroleum processing plant the attacks disrupted more than half of the kingdom s oil output and will affect global supplies trump tweeted we

"Saudi pipelines, oil installations and tankers have occasionally been attacked over the past two years, but analysts say what happened in eastern Saudi Arabia in the early hours of Saturday morning is a much larger escalation: a hit to the jugular of the kingdom’s oil industry.At 3.31am and 3.42am on Saturday, loud explosions erupted at Khurais oilfield and Abqaiq processing facility, both owned by Saudi Aramco, the country’s state-owned oil company, often described as the kingdom’s crown jewel.The explosions set off fires that took several hours to douse and appear to have caused significant damage. Saudi oil ministry sources said the production had been disrupted by about 5m barrels a day – nearly half the kingdom’s estimated output of 9.7m barrels and 5% of global production.The Houthis, the Iran-aligned rebel army that has been fighting a Saudi-led military coalition in neighbouring Yemen for the past four years, claimed responsibility for the attack.The Houthis recently acquired much more powerful drone technology that has given them the power to strike targets up to 1,500km away, according to the UN. Abqaiq is within about 1,000km of Houthi-held territory. In the past months, there have been unconfirmed reports of attacks by Houthi drones on civilian airports in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.But Saturday’s strikes would represent a marked increase in sophistication compared to those earlier attacks. Western and Saudi governments believe Iran has been assisting the Houthis to acquire and use the advanced drones – a charge both Tehran and the Yemeni rebels deny.However, the US says there is no evidence the attack originated in Yemen and has squarely blamed it on Iran, seeing it as part of a pattern of threats to oil tankers and infrastructure in past months that it says Iran has carried out in response to sanctions on Iranian oil that are crippling the Islamic Republic’s economy.The US government has produced satellite photos showing what officials said were at least 19 points of impact at the two Saudi energy facilities, including damage at the heart of the Abqaiq plant. Officials told US media the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south. Tehran says it had nothing to do with Saturday’s attack.Abqaiq is the world’s largest oil processing facility, where about two-thirds of the total Saudi supply is refined and cleaned of impurities such as sulphur and sand. “This is the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure,” said Homayoun Falakshahi, an oil and gas equity analyst at Kpler, a Paris-based energy data firm.A facility of such importance was supposed to be insulated from the wider instability of the Middle East. “Because of its importance it is very well protected, under extremely high security measures,” Falakshahi said.The fact that it can be severely disrupted is a sign that the world’s energy infrastructure is more vulnerable than previously believed, and considered a legitimate target.The Houthis are regarded as part of a network of militias in the Middle East who are sponsored or assisted in some way by Tehran, part of a broader fight to dominate the Middle East between Iran and Saudi Arabia that dates back to the Iranian revolution of 1979. The pair do not directly clash; the battle is playing out through proxy actors in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, among other countries.Iran continues to deny that it materially assists the Houthis but has become more openly supportive this year, inviting a Houthi spokesman to Tehran where he was praised as a “holy warrior” by the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.News of the attacks jolted the financial markets, sending the oil price soaring. The price of a barrel of Brent crude surged by 20% early on Monday to nearly $72 (£58, up from $60 per barrel). That’s a huge jump – the biggest move since the contract was created in the 1980s.It then dropped back to about $66 per barrel after Donald Trump pledged to release some of America’s oil reserves, to make up the shortfall from Saudi Arabia. That’s a two-month high, up 10% compared with Friday night.Economists believe the oil price could rise higher if Aramco cannot bring supplies back online quickly, or if there is military action in the Gulf.Higher oil prices can drag on global growth. It pushes up transport costs and the prices of petroleum-based products. This fuels inflation, leaving consumers with less disposable income.Trump says his government is “locked and loaded” and ready to respond to whoever carried out Saturday’s attack, hinting strongly that the US may see it as justification for a military strike on Iran.Yet any such attack would carry a significant risk of escalation – a chance that Trump has previously been unwilling to take.In the short term, the strikes appear to have scuttled any momentum towards Trump meeting with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, when the latter arrives in New York next week for the opening of the 74th UN general assembly. Although with the mercurial US president in charge, that too could quickly change.",Everything you need to know about the Saudi Arabia oil attacks,2019-09-16/11:20:27,saudi pipelines oil installations

"The third foreign national revealed this week to be imprisoned in Iran has been named by the Australian government as Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a Melbourne academic who has published work on the 2011 Arab uprisings and on authoritarian governments.Moore-Gilbert, a dual UK-Australian national, is Cambridge educated and worked as a lecturer in Islamic Studies at Melbourne University. She has been in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison for almost a year.Her case came to light this week along with those of another British-Australian woman, Jolie King, and her Australian boyfriend Mark Firkin, who have been held for the past 10 weeks in an unrelated incident.The Australian government has said it is lobbying Tehran to ensure all three are appropriately cared for. Both the British and Australian governments have been trying to keep the identities of their arrested citizens out of the public domain, believing diplomatic efforts to have them released would be more effective if conducted in private.The University of Melbourne’s website lists Dr Moore-Gilbert on its “Find an expert” page as a lecturer at the university’s Asia Institute.It says she “specialises in Middle Eastern politics, with a particular focus on the Arab Gulf states,” and that she had published work on the 2011 Arab uprisings, authoritarian governance, and on the role of new media technologies in political activism.Her most recent publications have been journal articles and book chapters regarding Bahrain’s “February 14” pro-democracy youth movement.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Saturday released a statement from Dr Moore-Gilbert’s family, which said: “We have been and continue to be in close contact with the Australian government.“Our family thanks the government and the University of Melbourne for their ongoing support at this distressing and sensitive time. We believe that the best chance of securing Kylie’s safe return is through diplomatic channels.“We will not be making any further comment and would like to request that our privacy – and that of our wider family and friends – is respected at this time.”While news of the trio’s incarcerations only surfaced this week, Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, says she has raised their cases “many times” with her Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif.Senator Payne has denied the arrests were politically motivated, although some reports have speculated the trio are being held in hope of giving Iran political leverage on a number of ongoing disputes with the western countries.“We have no reason to think that these arrests are connected to international concern over Iran’s nuclear programme, United Nations sanction enforcement or maritime security concerning the safety of civilian shipping,” Senator Payne said.News of the three prisoners this week has come amid a downturn in relations between Iran and the US-led western bloc, including the UK and Australia. Relations with Tehran and have been seriously strained over the re-imposition of economic sanctions after US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal.British and Iranian relations have been further inflamed by tensions in the Persian Gulf, including the Royal Marines’ seizure near Gibraltar in July of an Iranian oil tanker, the Adrian Darya 1, formerly known as Grace 1.Iran responded by seizing British-flagged oil tanker the Stena Impero in what was another chapter in a campaign of interfering with shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.While Britain released the Adrian Darya 1, the Stena Impero is still being held by Iran.Australia has maintained diplomatic relations with Tehran through recent decades where other western nations have abandoned them, or they have become acutely strained.But in August, the Australian prime minister committed to a US-led mission to patrol the Strait of Hormuz, off Iran’s south coast, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said “destabilising behaviour” – a thinly veiled reference to Iran’s capture of foreign-flagged ships – was a threat to Australian interests.King, a building designer, and Firkin, a construction manager, left their home in Perth, Western Australia, in 2017, documenting their travels on a blog called The Way Overland. They planned to drive from Perth to London.The editor of the Persian-language broadcaster Manoto TV, Pouria Zeraati, said on Twitter a source had told him the couple had been arrested “for flying a drone near the capital, Tehran”.Earlier reports suggested the couple had been camping in a military area around Jajrood in Tehran province.The couple were blogging their travels on YouTube and Instagram. Dozens of videos and photographs posted online appear to have been shot using a drone.“The family says this was a misunderstanding and Jolie King and her fiance Mark Firkin were unaware of the Iranian law which bans drone flights without a licence,” Zeraati said online.“Their trial has not been held yet and it is not clear what the Islamic Republic [of Iran] wants out of this arrest, as no one from the judiciary or intelligence services has made any comment on this.”Evin prison, the main detention centre for Iran’s political prisoners, also houses 41-year-old Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian mother of one who is midway through a five-year sentence on spying charges which began in 2016.While Iran has not commented publicly on any of the arrests, in April Foreign Minister

"The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, flies into Sochi on Thursday for talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that come after Moscow added its voice to criticism of his pre-election pledge to annex occupied Palestinian territories.Netanyahu said on Tuesday that he would annex up to a third of the West Bank if he is re-elected in next week’s parliamentary polls. His announcement was condemned by the Palestinians, Arab countries, the UN and the EU.The Russian foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Netanyahu’s move could “lead to a sharp escalation of tension in the region and undermine hopes for the establishment of a long-awaited peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours”. The Kremlin has not yet commented.The meeting in Sochi, on Russia’s Black Sea coast, is the third between Netanyahu and Putin this year. They also held talks ahead of Israeli elections in April. The two leaders have met more than a dozen times since 2015.Netanyahu and Putin are also due to discuss the conflict in Syria. Russia has backed the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, while Israel has conducted hundreds of strikes in the country, most of them against what it says are Iranian and Hezbollah targets. Both Iran and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shia group, support Assad.Netanyahu told Russia’s RBC media outlet that his good relationship with Putin had helped avert “a near-unavoidable clash” between the Israeli and Russian militaries in Syria. The two countries signed a deal in 2015 to coordinate their military action in Syria to avoid accidentally trading fire.Russian media reports said this week that Su-35 fighter jets had prevented Israeli warplanes from carrying out airstrikes in southern Syria. The incident came after Iranian-backed forces were reported to have launched a rocket attack on Israel.Putin is due to meet the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Ankara next week to discuss the Syria conflict. Russia offered to help Iran dodge US sanctions last month by allowing Tehran to transport crude oil through its ports in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014.Netanyahu sought to dissuade Russia from closer ties with Iran, telling RBC that Tehran posed a threat not only to Israel and the west, but also to Moscow.Netanayhu’s visit to Russia was interpreted at home as a last-minute attempt to win over Russia-speaking Israelis in next Tuesday’s election. He has launched an aggressive campaign to woo the minority of a million people, running ads in Russian and erecting a giant poster of himself and Putin on his Likud party’s Tel Aviv headquarters.The prime minister wants to steal voters from his ally-turned-rival, Avigdor Lieberman, himself an immigrant from the Soviet Union. He is widely predicted to win enough seats to become Israel’s kingmaker next week, and possibly end Netanyahu’s 13-year career in high office.Lieberman, a hardline secular ultranationalist, has denounced Netanyahu as weak on security and for making deals with religious parties. The 61-year-old former defence minister refused to join Likud’s previous coalition in May, shattering Netanyahu’s attempts to form a government and precipitating next week’s repeat poll.Netanyahu has also sought to appeal to far-right religious and nationalist voters who fear the political influence of Palestinian citizens of Israel. On Thursday Facebook suspended a chatbot on Netanyahu’s official page after it breached hate speech policy by sending visitors a message warning of Arabs who “want to destroy us all”.",Russia denounces Netanyahu's West Bank annexation plan,2019-09-12/17:37:08,the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu flies into sochi on thursday for talks with the russian president vladimir putin that come after moscow added its voice to criticism of his pre election pledge to annex occupied palestinian territories netanyahu said on tuesday that he would annex up to a third of the west bank if he is re elected in next week s parliamentary polls his announcement was condemned by the palestinians arab countries the un and the eu the russian foreign ministry said on wednesday that netanyahu s move could lead to a sharp escalation of tension in the region and undermine hopes for the establishment of a long awaited peace between israel and its arab neighbours the kremlin has not yet commented the meeting in sochi on russia s black sea coast is the third between netanyahu and putin this year they also held talks ahead of israeli elections in april the two leaders have met more than a dozen times since  netanyahu and putin are also due to discuss the conflict in syria russia has backed the syrian leader bashar al assad while israel has conducted hundreds of strikes in the country most of them against what it says are iranian and hezbollah targets both iran and hezbollah a lebanese shia group support assad netanyahu told russia s rbc media outlet that his good relationship with putin had helped avert a near unavoidable clash between the israeli and russian militaries in syria the two countries signed a deal in  to coordinate their military action in syria to avoid accidentally trading fire russian media reports said this week that su  fighter jets had prevented israeli warplanes from carrying out airstrikes in southern syria the incident came after iranian backed forces were reported to have launched a rocket attack on israel putin is due to meet the iranian president hassan rouhani and the turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan in ankara next week to discuss the syria conflict russia offered to help iran dodge us sanctions last month by allowing tehran to transport crude oil through its ports in crimea which russia seized from ukraine in  netanyahu sought to dissuade russia from closer ties with iran telling rbc that tehran posed a threat not only to israel and the west but also to moscow netanayhu s visit to russia was interpreted at home as a last minute attempt to win over russia speaking israelis in next tuesday s election he has launched an aggressive campaign to woo the minority of a million people running ads in russian and erecting a giant poster of himself and putin on his likud party s tel aviv headquarters the prime minister wants to steal voters from his ally turned rival avigdor lieberman himself an immigrant from the soviet union he is widely predicted to win enough seats to become israel s kingmaker next week and possibly end netanyahu s  year career in high office lieberman a hardline secular ultranationalist has denounced netanyahu as weak on security and for making deals with religious parties the  year old former defence minister refused to join likud s previous coalition in may shattering netanyahu s attempts to form a government and precipitating next week s repeat poll netanyahu has also sought to appeal to far right religious and nationalist voters who fear the political influence of palestinian citizens of israel on thursday facebook suspended a chatbot on netanyahu s official page after it breached hate speech policy by sending visitors a message warning of arabs who want to destroy us all ,Iran Sanctions,0.290489286
"The summoning of the Iranian ambassador to the British Foreign Office on Wednesday over broken assurances about the destination of an Iranian oil tanker, and now the arrest of two British-Australian nationals, marks yet another stage in the mutual blame game between Britain and Iran that leaves the relationship stuck deeper in a frustrating rut.From the British perspective, well articulated by the former Middle East minister Alistair Burt, those in the UK government who would have liked to build a new relationship with Iran in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal feel very badly let down by Tehran.Not only has there been no progress in high-profile consular cases such as that of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, arrested for spying in 2016, there has also been a steady stream of other British-Iranian dual nationals picked up on spurious grounds in recent weeks. Kameel Ahmady, an Iranian-British social anthropologist was arrested on 11 August and had no contact with his family except three phone calls. On 27 August, another Iranian-British citizen Anousheh Ashouri, a businessman who has been imprisoned since 2017, had been sentenced to 12 years in prison allegedly for spying for Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency and receiving €33,000 (£29,000) in illicit funds.On 18 August, Iran’s appeals court upheld a 10-year prison sentence against British Council employee Aras Amiri for “forming and organising a network for the purpose of overthrowing the Islamic Republic.”The latest arrest of three Australians, two with British passports, came around this time, but marks a new low point since they had no Iranian nationality. It has even led the Foreign Office to discreetly warn UK journalists thinking of travelling to Tehran independently against doing so.There is a general crackdown on free speech under way in Iran, covering Iranian journalists and human rights activists largely ordered by the judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi, appointed in March 2019. The arrests have been the subject of public protest by reformist MPs.But there is no doubt in British minds that these Australians have been targeted because of the approach of the UK and Australian governments to the wider Iran crisis.Similarly there is real anger in the Foreign Office that Iran has broken assurances given to British and Gibraltarian officials on what is said to be five occasions that if the Iranian ship seized by the British was released, it would not travel to Syria to unload its oil. Those assurances were given in a note, as well as verbally and personally by the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, British diplomats say.Iran’s envoy to London said on Wednesday the oil cargo of tanker Adrian Darya 1 was sold at sea to a private company, denying Tehran had broken assurances it had given over the vessel. He also insisted any EU’s sanctions on exports to Syria did not apply to Tehran. The original impounding of the ship by the British on grounds that it was intent on breaching the EU embargo on oil sales to Syria, may not have been a far-seeing piece of UK diplomacy, and largely reflected US private pressure to do so, but the ship’s release was negotiated by the British in a matter of five weeks.It was also released on 15 August in the knowledge that Iran had not yet released the British flagged Stena Impero, which was seized on 19 July as it passed through the strait of Hormuz. Seven of the 23 crew have been released, but the ship remains in Iranian hands.The Iranian Foreign Office at the weekend said the ship would be released soon, but in the complex Iranian government, the writ of the Iranian Foreign Office is not sacrosanct.From the British perspective the episode has made the UK look naive in the eyes of the US administration for even taking the Iranians’ words seriously. The now departed US national security adviser John Bolton openly mocked the British for being in denial about the true nature of Iran.British advocates of dialogue, such as Burt, say Tehran does not seem to understand the value of a unilateral gesture on issues such as releasing hostages, or how it could unlock something different.From the Iranian perspective, the catalogue of British failings is equally long. Grace 1, the Iranian ship, should never have been impounded since Iran is not obliged to follow an EU sanctions regime. The UK government has spent close on 30 years, and millions in legal costs, in refusing to pay the debt courts say it owes to Iran for the sale of Chieftain tanks.Above all Europeans, including Britain, talk a big game about the need for European sovereignty, but faced with an overweening US administration imposing sanctions on anyone that trades with Iran, the EU has proved powerless, and says the effectiveness of such sanctions is a necessary by-product of the dollar’s ubiquity as a trading currency.The bigger question is whether the departure of Bolton will, as hoped, reveal an opening in the cul-de-sac that is western-European relations. Burt, speaking to the Lords international relations committee last week, made the point that if Trump has decided not to go to war with Iran, as he appeared to when he did not retaliate for the downing of a US drone by Iran, the logical step must be to talk Tehran.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has been trying to create the detailed circumstances for this to occur. The US administration said again that Trump was willing to hold a summit with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, at the UN general assembly in New York this month.But for these high-profile “look me in the eye” summits to work, or for there to be any relenting on US sanctions, the ground debris has to be cleared. Issues like impounded ships, broken promises and hostage-taking have to be addressed. At the moment, there is no sign that is happening. If anything the thicket of disagreements is only becoming more dense.",Britain-Iran relationship caught up in mutual blame game,2019-09-11/13:42:16,the summoning of the iranian ambassador to the british foreign office on wednesday over broken assurances about the destination of an iranian oil tanker and now the arrest of two british australian nationals marks yet another stage in the mutual blame game between britain and iran that leaves the relationship stuck deeper in a frustrating rut from the british perspective well articulated by the former middle east minister alistair burt those in the uk government who would have liked to build a new relationship with iran in the wake of the  nuclear deal feel very badly let down by tehran not only has there been no progress in high profile consular cases such as that of nazanin zaghari ratcliffe arrested for spying in  there has also been a steady stream of other british iranian dual nationals picked up on spurious grounds in recent

iran s appeals court upheld a  year prison sentence against british council employee aras amiri for forming and organising a network for the purpose of overthrowing the islamic republic the latest arrest of three australians two with british passports came around this time but marks a new low point since they had no iranian nationality it has even led the foreign office to discreetly warn uk journalists thinking of travelling to tehran independently against doing so there is a general crackdown on free speech under way in iran covering iranian journalists and human rights activists largely ordered by the judiciary chief ebrahim raisi appointed in march  the arrests have been the subject of public protest by reformist mps but there is no doubt in british minds that these australians have been targeted because of the approach of the uk and australian governments to the wider iran crisis similarly there is real anger in the foreign office that iran has broken assurances given to british and gibraltarian officials on what is said to be five occasions that if the iranian ship seized by the british was released it would not travel to syria to unload its oil those assurances were given in a note as well as verbally and personally by the iranian foreign minister javad zarif british diplomats say iran s envoy to london said on wednesday the oil cargo of tanker

In August, the Australian prime minister committed to a US-led mission to patrol the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes. Scott Morrison said “destabilising behaviour” – a thinly veiled reference to Iran’s capture of foreign-flagged ships – was a threat to Australian interests.A spokesperson for Australia’s department of foreign affairs and trade confirmed the department was providing consular assistance to the families of three Australians detained in Iran. The Australian government updated its travel advice for Iran, warning: “There is a risk that foreigners, including Australians, could be arbitrarily detained or arrested in Iran. We can’t guarantee consular access if you are detained or arrested. We also can’t guarantee access to legal representation.”The advice also urges travellers not to visit military or nuclear sites, which, it says, “are not always clearly marked”.An increasingly unpredictable brinkmanship has emerged between the US – and by association, its allies – and Iran since Washington withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018.

Most hold Iranian citizenship alongside another nationality, but Tehran does not recognise dual citizenship and these prisoners are routinely denied access to embassy officials from their other country of nationality.The centre said there was a pattern to the arrest of foreign nationals, involving prolonged solitary confinement and interrogations, a lack of due legal process and access to counsel, and a denial of consular access or visits by the UN or humanitarian organisations.

"Donald Trump’s abrupt dismissal of John Bolton, his national security adviser, may reflect the near breakdown in personal relations between the two men, as well as Bolton’s rivalry with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, but it will also have implications for US foreign policy in a range of flashpoints.The US president’s antipathy to globalism and multilateralism will remain but there will be a rebalancing towards Trump’s instinctive anti-interventionism, coupled with his penchant for personal diplomacy. At best, it may also lead to greater policy coordination between Washington’s national security agencies and, as a result, more consistent advice being handed to an often under-briefed president.In Afghanistan Bolton was a fierce opponent of the plan for the remaining US troops to leave by the end of the year. Yet ironically, only this weekend Trump appears to have come closer to Bolton, decisively abandoning his plan for extraordinary talks at Camp David with Taliban leaders, two days before the anniversary of 9/11. Trump said he ditched the secret summit after a suicide bomber killed a UN soldier in Kabul, but his decision also reflected growing unease in the defence community that the president was planning to abandon Afghanistan to terrorists without any plan to protect the legitimate Afghan government before national elections.Bolton conspicuously went into meetings on Venezuela with documents emphasising plans to send US troops into the country, presumably to overthrow the leftwing government of Nicolás Maduro. Bolton’s overoptimistic assessments of both how quickly Maduro would fall, and the gathering mood of rebellion in the Venezuelan military, dented his credibility with Trump. But US support for the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, remains firm, and only this week US officials were pressing the EU to step up sanctions. Nevertheless, the policy has lost momentum.Pompeo, Bolton and the vice-president, Mike Pence, all advised Trump this summer to mount an attack on Iran after a US drone was shot down. Trump pulled back, fearing the consequences of a military confrontation. This has left him dependent on a policy of maximum economic pressure, but European allies, resisted by Trump, have argued that if the US is not going to attack Iran, the only alternative is to talk to Tehran. Bolton’s predictions of an opposition uprising, leading to the regime change he craves, have failed to materialise as reformers and hardliners unite against an external oppressor. Trump, with a penchant for high-wire summits, would like a meeting with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, if terms could be agreed leading to a renegotiated nuclear deal. But that will only happen if Bolton’s departure is accompanied by a US willingness to lift sanctions on Iranian oil exports. Speaking after Bolton’s departure on Tuesday, Pompeo echoed Trump’s suggestion that the president could meet his Iranian counterpart at the UN General Assembly later this month.Trump has welcomed the French government’s efforts to bring Russia in from the cold, a persistent theme of the US president’s foreign policy that has been thwarted by European and bipartisan resistance in Washington. That resistance was supported by Bolton, an old adversary of Vladimir Putin who did not see Russia outside a cold war framework. Trump, stripped off Bolton, now has a better chance to pursue an opening with Moscow after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, encouraged talks on Ukraine.Bolton had a record during his period in the Bush administration of taking on the Pyongyang administration and under Trump had advocated pre-emptive strikes. He strongly opposed opening a path towards talks with Kim Jong-un. That soon put him at odds with Trump when the president began efforts to engage in face-to-face negotiations with the North Korean leader. Trump has consistently ignored Bolton’s advice and met with Kim multiple times, even though he says he is in no rush to strike a deal. Meanwhile, Bolton pointed to Kim’s untrustworthiness in refusing to surrender his nuclear programme and North Korea’s repeated short-range missile tests. Bolton said these tests were in breach of UN resolutions, but Trump disagreed. Bolton has even been accused of operating behind the scenes to torpedo progress on the talks, including working against Stephen Biegun, the special envoy for North Korea negotiations.",How will John Bolton's dismissal affect US foreign policy?,2019-09-10/19:15:09,donald trump s abrupt dismissal of john bolton his national security adviser may reflect the near breakdown in personal relations between the two men as well as bolton s rivalry with the secretary of state mike pompeo but it will also have implications for us foreign policy in a range of flashpoints the us president s antipathy to globalism and multilateralism will remain but there will be a rebalancing towards trump s instinctive anti interventionism coupled with his penchant for personal diplomacy at best it may also lead to greater policy coordination between washington s national security agencies and as a result more consistent advice being handed to an often under briefed president in afghanistan bolton was a fierce opponent of the plan for the remaining us troops to leave by the end of the year yet ironically only this weekend trump appears to have come closer to bolton decisively abandoning his plan for extraordinary talks at camp david with taliban leaders two days before the anniversary of   trump said he ditched the secret summit after a suicide bomber killed a un soldier in kabul but his decision also reflected growing unease in the defence community that the president was planning to abandon afghanistan to terrorists without any plan to protect the legitimate afghan government before national elections bolton conspicuously went into meetings on venezuela with documents emphasising plans to send us troops into the country presumably to overthrow the leftwing government of nicolás maduro bolton s overoptimistic assessments of both how quickly maduro would fall and the gathering mood of rebellion in the venezuelan military dented his credibility with trump but us support for the opposition leader juan guaidó remains firm and only this week us officials were pressing the eu to step up sanctions nevertheless the policy has lost momentum pompeo bolton and the vice president mike pence all advised trump this summer to mount an attack on iran after a us drone was shot down trump pulled back fearing the consequences of a military confrontation this has left him dependent on a policy of maximum economic pressure but european allies resisted by trump have argued that if the us is not going to attack iran the only alternative is to talk to tehran bolton s predictions of an opposition uprising leading to the regime change he craves have failed to materialise as reformers and hardliners unite against an external oppressor trump with a penchant for high wire summits would like a meeting with the iranian president hassan rouhani if terms could be agreed leading to a renegotiated nuclear deal but that will only happen if bolton s departure is accompanied by a us willingness to lift sanctions on iranian oil exports speaking after bolton s departure on tuesday pompeo echoed trump s suggestion that the president could meet his iranian counterpart at the un general assembly later this month trump has welcomed the french government s efforts to bring russia in from the cold a persistent theme of the us president s foreign policy that has been thwarted by european and bipartisan resistance in washington that resistance was supported by bolton an old adversary of vladimir putin who did not see russia outside a cold war framework trump stripped off bolton now has a better chance to pursue an opening with moscow after the french president emmanuel macron encouraged talks on ukraine bolton had a record during his period in the bush administration of taking on the pyongyang administration and under trump had advocated pre emptive strikes he strongly opposed opening a path towards talks with kim jong un that soon put him at odds with trump when the president began efforts to engage in face to face negotiations with the north korean leader trump has consistently ignored bolton s advice and met with kim multiple times even though he says he is in no rush to strike a deal meanwhile bolton pointed to kim s untrustworthiness in refusing to surrender his nuclear programme and north korea s repeated short range missile tests bolton said these tests were in breach of un resolutions but trump disagreed bolton has even been accused of operating behind the scenes to torpedo progress on the talks including working against stephen biegun the special envoy for north korea negotiations ,Iran Sanctions,0.24967216
"Britain has accused Iran of breaching assurances that it would not sell oil to Syria from an Iranian tanker released by authorities in Gibraltar on the condition that the 2.1m barrels it was carrying would not be sold to the “murderous regime” of Bashar al-Assad.Tehran acknowledged at the weekend that the oil had been sold and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination, after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.Iran, desperate for revenue from oil exports, did not formally confirm the customer was Syria.The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, summoned Hamid Baeidinejad, the Iranian ambassador to the UK, to a meeting on Wednesday to ask why the assurances given to the Gibraltarian authorities had not been honoured.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentBritish officials are relatively certain from intelligence assessments that the oil was offloaded on to smaller boats.British marines seized Grace 1 in July after it entered Gibraltarian waters, claiming the oil was destined for Assad and Syria in breach of EU economic sanctions.The Foreign Office says Iranian officials gave as many as five different assurances to British officials – including one in writing to Gibraltar’s government – that the ship’s cargo would not go to Syria.“Iran repeatedly gave assurances to the government of Gibraltar that the Grace 1/Adrian Darya 1 would not deliver oil to any EU-sanctioned entity in Syria or elsewhere. It is now clear that Iran has breached these assurances and that the oil has been transferred to Syria and Assad’s murderous regime,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.“Iran’s actions represent an unacceptable violation of international norms and the UK will raise the issue at the United Nations later this month.”Raab said: “Iran has shown complete disregard for its own assurances over Adrian Darya 1. This sale of oil to Assad’s brutal regime is part of a pattern of behaviour by the government of Iran designed to disrupt regional security.“This includes illegally supplying weapons to Houthi insurgents in Yemen, support for Hezbollah terrorists and most recently its attempts to hijack commercial ships passing through the Gulf.“We want Iran to come in from the cold, but the only way to do that is to keep its word and comply with the rules-based international system.”The UK insisted the tanker was seized only in pursuit of EU sanctions policy, and not in support of the US effort to cut off Iranian oil exports, a strategy with which the UK does not agree.Britain is pursuing a policy of maximum economic pressure on Iran in an attempt to force Tehran to renegotiate the joint comprehensive plan of action, a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme signed in 2015.Iran has argued it was not a party to the EU sanctions against Damascus, but also said the oil was not destined for Syria. Subsequently, following negotiations both in the Foreign Office in London and in Gibraltar, the British claimed assurances had been given that the oil would not be sold to Syria.The US attempted to block the departure of the ship from Gibraltar, and US officials then tried to contact the captain of the ship to offer him a substantial sum in return for not selling the oil to Syria but instead taking the ship to a port at which the US could seize the cargo.The Gibraltar first minister, Fabian Picardo, said in a statement: “It will be a massive volte face for Iran to have failed to live up to its written undertaking in the full glare of international public opinion.“They will really make themselves look shifty and unreliable if they have acted contrary to their repeated assertions and undertakings.”",UK accuses Iran of selling oil from seized tanker to Syria,2019-09-10/17:00:47,britain has accused iran of breaching assurances that it would not sell oil to syria from an iranian

international norms and the uk will raise the issue at the united nations later this month raab said iran has shown complete disregard for its own assurances over adrian darya  this sale of oil to assad s brutal regime is part of a pattern of behaviour by the government of iran designed to disrupt regional security this includes illegally supplying weapons to houthi insurgents in yemen support for hezbollah terrorists and most recently its attempts to hijack commercial ships passing through the gulf we want iran to come in from the cold but the only way to do that is to keep its word and comply with the rules based international system the uk insisted the tanker was seized only in pursuit of eu sanctions policy and not in support of the us effort to cut off iranian oil exports a

"Benjamin Netanyahu has unveiled what he claims was a previously undisclosed Iranian nuclear weapons facility and accused Tehran of destroying the site to hide the evidence.“This is what I have to say to the tyrants of Tehran,” Netanyahu said. “Israel knows what you’re doing, Israel knows when you’re doing it, and Israel knows where you’re doing it.”Without providing details, he accused Iran of using the facility near the city of Abadeh to “conductexperiments to develop nuclear weapons”.The Israeli prime minister was immediately accused of using sensitive intelligence to appear statesmanlike, just a week ahead of next Tuesday’s election.Fighting a fierce reelection battle, Netanyahu has repeatedly promoted himself as the only leader capable of dealing with global security threats. His hastily-gathered press conference, televised during primetime evening slot, showed satellite photos from June of the site near the central Iranian city.He said the facility was destroyed in July, after the Iranians realised they had been discovered, but it was not clear why he waited until now to disclose the details.“Netanyahu’s use of sensitive security information for propaganda proves that his judgment is flawed,” said Benny Gantz, the head of the main opposition party, Blue and White. “Even in his last days as prime minister, Netanyahu worries only about Netanyahu.”Gantz’s running mate, Yair Lapid, accused the prime minister of “shocking national irresponsibility”, adding, “the Iranian nuclear program cannot be used for campaign shenanigans”.Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, responded to Netanyahu on Twitter, referring to him as “the possessor of real nukes” who “cries wolf – on an alleged ‘demolished’ site in Iran”.Zarif did not address Netanyahu’s claims about Abadeh but accused the Israeli prime minister of wanting another war. In April 2018, Netanyahu made a similar announcement, claiming that Israel had discovered tens of thousands of documents from what he called Iran’s “Atomic Archives”, which he presented as new evidence. However, key documents had been made public years earlier in 2011 by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentThat presentation was seen as also having a public relations element. But that time it appeared directed at Donald Trump, pressuring the US president to pull out of the 2015 nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, which he did less than two weeks later.Netanyahu had lobbied hard against the Obama-era agreement that lifted some sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, labelling it from the outset as “a bad mistake of historic proportions”.The IAEA and US intelligence services have said for years that Iran halted organised efforts at exploring nuclear weapons in 2003. Netanyahu did not make clear whether the alleged nuclear weapons work at the facility was before this date, nor he did make clear what kind of nuclear weapons work the Iranians are alleged to have conducted thereReuters news agency reported on Sunday that the nuclear watchdog had found traces of uranium at a separate facility that Netanyahu revealed in another announcement a year ago, calling it a “secret atomic warehouse”. It was not clear if the traces were remnants of material that predate the landmark 2015 deal.Monday’s announcement also comes as world powers have expressed interest in a renewed dialogue with Iran, something Netanyahu sees as counterproductive. Trump has even suggested he could meet with Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani.Iran and three European countries – Britain, France and Germany – have been engaged in talks to save the landmark 2015 accord. The three countries insist that it remains the best way to prevent nuclear proliferation in the region.Iran has taken steps away from the deal since Trump pulled out. On Wednesday, Rouhani, said the country would expand its work on new centrifuges for enriching uranium.During a visit to London, Netanyahu said: “This is not the time to hold talks with Iran. This is the time to increase the pressure on Iran.”Responding to the suggestion that his brief visit to the UK was designed to boost his electoral appeal, Netanyahu said: “Those delusional claims are a lie.

"Unclaimed airstrikes in eastern Syria have killed 18 Iranian and pro-Iran fighters, according to a war monitoring group, as tensions around Tehran’s military presence in the region intensify.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes in and around the town of Abu Kamal began late on Sunday and continued after midnight, targeting bases, arms depots and vehicles.Suspicion is likely to fall on Israel, which has conducted hundreds of bombing raids in the country, often against Iranian military assets and personnel. It accuses Tehran of using Syria, which neighbours Israel, as a base to attack it.The Israel Defence Forces did not comment on whether it was behind the attack. Later on Monday the Israeli military said an Iranian-backed Shia militia on the outskirts of the Syrian capital, Damascus, had fired “a number of rockets” towards Israel. All failed to hit Israeli territory, it said. It was not clear if the attempted rocket attacks against Israel were a response to the bombing raid.Separately, Iran’s main proxy force in Lebanon, Hezbollah, claimed it had shot down an Israeli drone that crossed the border, a week after the bitter enemies traded fire for the first time in years.The unmanned aircraft was flying near the southern Lebanese town of Ramyah, the Iranian-backed group said, adding that it fighters had removed the wreckage.Asked about the downed drone in Lebanon, Israel’s military confirmed it had lost a drone but said it “fell inside Lebanon territory during a routine mission”. An army spokesperson did not say what had caused the crash, adding that the drone was “standard size, nothing too big … There is no concern information could be taken from it.”Hezbollah and the Israeli army exchanged brief but intense fire on 1 September, the fiercest bout since the 2006 war. It began when a Hezbollah squad fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli military vehicle at the frontier, to which Israel immediately responded with heavy shelling and helicopter strikes on the area.That flare-up was also sparked by claims of Israeli drone use in Lebanon. Days earlier, Hezbollah had accused Israel of attempting to attack it with two drones in its stronghold of southern Beirut. Those drones, about which Israel would not comment, were suspected of targeting equipment for making precision guidance missiles.Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, blamed Israel for the alleged drone attack and promised to retaliate. He also vowed his fighters would target Israeli drones that entered Lebanon’s airspace in the future.The two adversaries fought a deadly month-long conflict in 2006 that killed about 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and roughly 160 in Israel. Since then incidents of hostile action have been rare but the renewed violence has raised fears of the potential for another conflict.Israel says it has intelligence that Iranhas been helping Hezbollah build guided missiles in Lebanon, which it said it would not tolerate.It has targeted Hezbollah in Syria, whose forces entered the civil war in support of President Bashar al-Assad, but has largely refrained from attacks on Lebanese soil, fearing it may lead to reprisal strikes.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said last month that Iran had “no immunity, anywhere”. He added: “We will act, and currently are acting, against them, wherever it is necessary.”A crisis between Iran and the US over a collapsing nuclear deal, hefty sanctions imposed by Washington, and Iran’s support for Shia militia in Iraq have raised fears of an escalating conflict in the Middle East.",Airstrikes kill 18 pro-Iran fighters in eastern Syria,2019-09-09/16:07:34,unclaimed airstrikes in eastern syria have killed  iranian and pro iran fighters according to a war monitoring group as tensions around tehran s military presence in the region intensify the britain based syrian observatory for human rights said the strikes in and around the town of abu kamal began late on sunday and continued after midnight targeting bases arms depots and vehicles suspicion is likely to fall on israel which has conducted hundreds of bombing raids in the country often against iranian military assets and personnel it accuses tehran of using syria which neighbours israel as a base to attack it the israel defence forces did not comment on whether it was behind the attack later on monday the israeli military said an iranian backed shia militia on the outskirts of the syrian capital damascus had fired a number of rockets towards israel all failed to hit israeli territory it said it was not clear if the attempted rocket attacks against israel were a response to the bombing raid separately iran s main proxy force in lebanon hezbollah claimed it had shot down an israeli drone that crossed the border a week after the bitter enemies traded fire for the first time in years the unmanned aircraft was flying near the southern lebanese town of ramyah the iranian backed group said adding that it fighters had removed the wreckage asked about the downed drone in lebanon israel s military confirmed it had lost a drone but said it fell inside lebanon territory during a routine mission an army spokesperson did not say what had caused the crash adding that the drone was standard size nothing too big there is no concern information could be taken from it hezbollah and the israeli army exchanged brief but intense fire on  september the fiercest bout since the  war it began when a hezbollah squad fired anti tank missiles at an israeli military vehicle at the frontier to which israel immediately responded with heavy shelling and helicopter strikes on the area that flare up was also sparked by claims of israeli drone use in lebanon days earlier hezbollah had accused israel of attempting to attack it with two drones in its stronghold of southern beirut those drones about which israel would not comment were suspected of targeting equipment for making precision guidance missiles hassan nasrallah hezbollah s leader blamed israel for the alleged drone attack and promised to retaliate he also vowed his fighters would target israeli drones that entered lebanon s airspace in the future the two adversaries fought a deadly month long conflict in  that killed about   people in lebanon mostly civilians and roughly  in israel since then incidents of hostile action have been rare but the renewed violence has raised fears of the potential for another conflict israel says it has intelligence that iranhas been helping hezbollah build guided missiles in lebanon which it said it would not tolerate it has targeted hezbollah in syria whose forces entered the civil war in support of president bashar al assad but has largely refrained from attacks on lebanese soil fearing it may lead to reprisal strikes israel s prime minister benjamin netanyahu said last month that iran had no immunity anywhere he added we will act and currently are acting against them wherever it is necessary a crisis between iran and the us over a collapsing nuclear deal hefty sanctions imposed by washington and iran s support for shia militia in iraq have raised fears of an escalating conflict in the middle east ,Iran Sanctions,0.542546391
"Britain is seeking to establish whether Iran has sold oil to Syria in breach of written undertakings given by Tehran to authorities in Gibraltar.Iran’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that a tanker seized by British Marines on 9 July and released in August had reached its final destination “on the Mediterranean coast” and sold its oil – without identifying the country.However, Adrian Darya, previously called Grace 1, has been seen off the coast of Syria for the past three days.The supertanker was detained off Gibraltar for allegedly breaking EU sanctions on Syria. On 15 August a court in Gibraltar released it when Iran gave assurances it would not sail to Syria, despite pressure from the US for the ship’s continued detainment.The US Department of Justice issued a warrant for the seizure of the ship, and the US Department of State has confirmed that US officials subsequently offered the ship’s Indian captain millions to take the ship’s oil to a port where the oil – worth as much as as £110m – could be impounded by the US. After the captain gave no positive response, he and the ship were put under US sanctions.Since leaving Gibraltar the ship had taken a peripatetic route towards Syria, but was last photographed off the Russian navy port of Tartus in Syria. TankerTrackers, a firm that monitors oil tankers, has seen no evidence that its 2.1m barrels of oil have been discharged.“We will continue to put pressure on Iran and as President Trump said, there will be no waivers of any kind for Iran’s oil,” US Treasury official Sigal Mandelker told Reuters on Sunday.The UK argued that an EU embargo on oil sales to Syria entitled the UK to impound the tanker once it entered British waters. Iran says it is not subject to the EU sanctions regime.In apparent retaliation for the seizure of the tanker, the Iranians seized the British-flagged vessel Stena Impero in the strait of Hormuz. On Sunday the Iranian foreign ministry said that ship would be released soon, adding that preparations for the ship’s release were at their last stages. Last week it released seven of the ship’s crew. Sixteen of the crew, none of whom were British, remained on board, and Stena Bulk, the owner of Stena Impero, said last week it was working tirelessly to secure their release, adding there was no evidence the ship had breached any maritime regulations.It is not clear if the UK would have any powers if indeed the Iranian oil has been sold to Syria, but the episode will hardly do much to rebuild shattered trust between Tehran and London, and will be used by Washington hawks to argue Iran’s word cannot be taken at face value.John Bolton, the US national security advisor, tweeted last week that anyone who thought the oil was not bound for Syria was in denial.Privately, some British diplomats admit it was a mistake to succumb to US pressure to capture Grace 1, given the high stakes wider negotiations between Europe and Iran aimed at trying to keep Iran inside the 2015 nuclear deal.Tehran on Saturday detailed its third planned set of steps to reduce its obligations under the deal, saying it could not stay inside the deal unilaterally. It said it had begun injecting uranium gas into advanced centrifuges and that the country will no longer abide by the deal’s limits on its nuclear research and developments.A French plan for a $15bn credit line to help the Iranians sell their oil appears to have foundered because of US objections to reintroducing oil export waivers, a precondition for the plan gaining traction. The credit line was seen as a way to start talks between Washington and Tehran on a reworked nuclear deal.",British-Iranian relations strained as oil tanker is seen off Syria,2019-09-08/19:35:21,britain is seeking to establish whether iran has sold oil to syria in breach of written undertakings given by tehran to authorities in gibraltar iran s foreign ministry said on sunday that a tanker seized by british marines on  july and released in august had reached its final destination on the mediterranean coast and sold its oil without identifying the country however adrian darya previously called grace  has been seen off the coast of syria for the past three days the supertanker was detained off gibraltar for allegedly breaking eu sanctions on syria on  august a court in gibraltar released it when iran gave assurances it would not sail to syria despite pressure from the us for the ship s continued detainment the us department of justice issued a warrant for the seizure of the ship and the us department of state has confirmed that us officials subsequently offered the ship s indian captain millions to take the ship s oil to a port where the oil worth as much as as m could be impounded by the us after the captain gave no positive response he and the ship were put under us sanctions since leaving gibraltar the ship had taken a peripatetic route towards syria but was last photographed off the russian navy port of tartus in syria tankertrackers a firm that monitors oil tankers has seen no evidence that its  m barrels of oil have been discharged we will continue to put pressure on iran and as president trump said there will be no waivers of any kind for iran s oil us treasury official sigal mandelker told  on sunday the uk argued that an eu embargo on oil sales to syria entitled the uk to impound the tanker once it entered british waters iran says it is not subject to the eu sanctions regime in apparent retaliation for the seizure of the tanker the iranians seized the british flagged vessel stena impero in the strait of hormuz on sunday the iranian foreign ministry said that ship would be released soon adding that preparations for the ship s release were at their last stages last week it released seven of the ship s crew sixteen of the crew none of whom were british remained on board and stena bulk the owner of stena impero said last week it was working tirelessly to secure their release adding there was no evidence the ship had breached any maritime regulations it is not clear if the uk would have any powers if indeed the iranian oil has been sold to syria but the episode will hardly do much to rebuild shattered trust between tehran and london and will be used by washington hawks to argue iran s word cannot be taken at face value john bolton the us national security advisor tweeted last week that anyone who thought the oil was not bound for syria was in denial privately some british diplomats admit it was a mistake to succumb to us pressure to capture grace  given the high stakes wider negotiations between europe and iran aimed at trying to keep iran inside the  nuclear deal tehran on saturday detailed its third planned set of steps to reduce its obligations under the deal saying it could not stay inside the deal unilaterally it said it had begun injecting uranium gas into advanced centrifuges and that the country will no longer abide by the deal s limits on its nuclear research and developments a french plan for a bn credit line to help the iranians sell their oil appears to have foundered because of us objections to reintroducing oil export waivers a precondition for the plan gaining traction the credit line was seen as a way to start talks between washington and tehran on a reworked nuclear deal ,Iran Sanctions,0.220050678
"Iran has announced it has started using more advanced centrifuges that could accelerate the development of an atomic weapon in its latest attempt to pressure European powers to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal.Behrouz Kamalvandi, the Iranian nuclear agency spokesman, told a press conference on Saturday the country did not intend to use the faster centrifuges to enrich uranium to 20% levels – an important threshold on the path to weapons-grade material – but that it had the capacity to do so.“We have started lifting limitations on our research and development imposed by the deal,” Kamalvandi said. “It will include development of more rapid and advanced centrifuges.“The European parties to the deal should know that there is not much time left, and if there is some action to be taken [to rescue the nuclear agreement], it should be done quickly.”Iran was in compliance of the 2015 international agreement intended to curb its development of nuclear weapons until the US pulled out of the deal in May last year and reimposed crippling economic sanctions.European signatories to the deal led by France have unsuccessfully sought to find ways to help Tehran evade the US restrictions. Iran is increasing the pressure on Europe to do so, by gradually walking away from its nuclear commitments, including the pledge to refine uranium only using first-generation IR-1 centrifuges.Kamalvandi said the country had started using IR-4 and IR-6 centrifuges since Friday and would soon test even more advanced models. Officials in the country say an IR-6 can produce enriched uranium 10 times as fast as an IR-1.Analysts said the announcement was carefully calibrated to highlight the urgency on France and others to help relieve Iran’s ailing economy, while avoiding triggering an armed response from the US or forcing Europe to formally abandon the deal.“These are all very calculated because they do not want to upset the Europeans and make it less likely for them to save the nuclear agreement,” said Holly Dagres, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council who specialises in Iran’s nuclear program and its relations with the US.“These are symbolic gestures to say: ‘Time is running out, this deal is hanging by a string, you need to do something’.”Elements in Iran have been accused of trying to sell oil to Syria in breach of UN sanctions, leading earlier this year to the seizure of a tanker carrying approximately $100m (£81m) worth of oil thought to be headed for a Syrian port.The seizure of the vessel is believed to have led Iran to capture a British-flagged ship, the Stena Impero, by the country’s Revolutionary Guards in July. The ship remains impounded though seven crew members were released this week, leaving 16 aboard.The Iranian tanker, now called the Adrian Darya, was released on the orders of a Gibraltar court in August and was photographed on Friday close to the Syrian port of Tartus, according to satellite photographs released by a US space technology company.Maxar Technologies Inc said the image showed the tanker Adrian Darya 1 very close to Tartus on 6 September. The ship appeared to have turned off its transponder in the Mediterranean west of Syria, ship-tracking data showed. The tanker sent its last signal giving its position between Cyprus and Syria sailing north on Monday afternoon.Iran’s coast guard seized another vessel on Saturday for allegedly smuggling fuel in the Gulf and detained its 12 crew members from the Philippines, the semi-official news agency ISNA reported.Kamalvandi said on Saturday the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, would continue to be allowed to monitor Iranian nuclear sites and that it had been informed about Iran’s “new nuclear steps”. But he set a 60-day deadline for France, Germany and Britain to find a solution to the US sanctions, after which further nuclear escalation could follow.“When the other sides do not carry out their commitments, they should not expect Iran to fulfil its commitments,” Kamalvandi said.Reuters contributed to this report",Iran puts pressure on Europe to save nuclear deal within 60-day deadline,2019-09-07/15:32:40,iran has announced it has started using more advanced centrifuges that could accelerate the development of an atomic weapon in its latest attempt to pressure european powers to salvage a  nuclear deal behrouz kamalvandi the iranian nuclear agency spokesman told a press conference on saturday the country did not intend to use the faster centrifuges to enrich uranium to  levels an important threshold on the path to weapons grade material but that it had the capacity to do so we have started lifting limitations on our research and development imposed by the deal kamalvandi said it will include development of more rapid and advanced centrifuges the european parties to the deal should know that there is not much time left and if there is some action to be taken to rescue the nuclear agreement it should be done quickly iran was in compliance of the  international agreement intended to curb its development of nuclear weapons until the us pulled out of the deal in may last year and reimposed crippling economic sanctions european signatories to the deal led by france have unsuccessfully sought to find ways to help tehran evade the us restrictions iran is increasing the pressure on europe to do so by gradually walking away from its nuclear commitments including the pledge to refine uranium only using first generation ir  centrifuges kamalvandi said the country had started using ir  and ir  centrifuges since friday and would soon test even more advanced models officials in the country say an ir  can produce enriched uranium  times as fast as an ir  analysts said the announcement was carefully calibrated to highlight the urgency on france and others to help relieve iran s ailing economy while avoiding triggering an armed response from the us or forcing europe to formally abandon the deal these are all very calculated because they do not want to upset the europeans and make it less likely for them to save the nuclear agreement said holly dagres a nonresident fellow at the atlantic council who specialises in iran s nuclear program and its relations with the us these are symbolic gestures to say time is running out this deal is hanging by a string you need to do something elements in iran have been accused of trying to sell oil to syria in breach of un sanctions leading earlier this year to the seizure of a tanker carrying approximately m m worth of oil thought to be headed for a syrian port the seizure of the vessel is believed to have led iran to capture a british flagged ship the stena impero by the country s revolutionary guards in july the ship remains impounded though seven crew members were released this week leaving  aboard the iranian tanker now called the adrian darya was released on the orders of a gibraltar court in august and was photographed on friday close to the syrian port of tartus according to satellite photographs released by a us space technology company maxar technologies inc said the image showed the tanker adrian darya  very close to tartus on  september the ship appeared to have turned off its transponder in the mediterranean west of syria ship tracking data showed the tanker sent its last signal giving its position between cyprus and syria sailing north on monday afternoon iran s coast guard seized another vessel on saturday for allegedly smuggling fuel in the gulf and detained its  crew members from the philippines the semi official news agency isna reported kamalvandi said on saturday the international atomic energy agency the un s nuclear watchdog would continue to be allowed to monitor iranian nuclear sites and that it had been informed about iran s new nuclear steps but he set a  day deadline for france germany and britain to find a solution to the us sanctions after which further nuclear escalation could follow when the other sides do not carry out their commitments they should not expect iran to fulfil its commitments kamalvandi said  contributed to this report,Iran Sanctions,0.224679157
"The US state department has shrugged off a French initiative aimed at defusing tensions with Iran, and stepped up economic pressure once more, offering a reward for information that helps disrupt Iranian oil smuggling.A few hours later, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said that the country would expand its development work on new centrifuges for enriching uranium, in a third phased step away from compliance with a 2015 multilateral nuclear deal, likely to escalate the standoff with the US even further.France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, had sought to mediate in the standoff, and tried at last month’s G7 in Biarritz to persuade Donald Trump to accept a confidence-building proposal, by which Iran would return to compliance with the 2015 deal in return for partial relief from US oil sanctions, and a $15bn credit line to finance oil sales.Trump responded positively in Biarritz, suggesting he would accept the scheme if the US did not have to contribute to the credit line.However, on Wednesday, the state department’s special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, called into question the very existence of the French proposal. Asked about the initiative on Wednesday, Hook said: “There is no concrete proposal. We have no idea if there will be one. So we’re not going to comment on something that doesn’t exist.”Hook announced a ratcheting up of the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, offering a $15m reward for anyone offering information that led to the disruption of oil smuggling the US says is being carried out by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).The state department also imposed sanctions on 16 entities and 10 individuals it accused of being part of an IRGC network smuggling oil to the Assad regime in Syria and Hezbullah in Lebanon, “and other terrorist actors”.As he was making the announcement, the Financial Times reported that Hook had personally emailed the captain of a tanker carrying Iranian oil, and offered him millions of dollars if he would steer the ship, the Grace 1, to a country where it could be impounded.According to the account, which was confirmed by the state department, the first email was sent 11 days after the ship (now renamed the Adrian Darya 1) was released by Gibraltar, where it was temporarily held on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria.“With this money you can have any life you wish and be well-off in old age,” Hook, the head of the state department’s Iran Action Group, emailed the ship’s captain, . It warned him: “If you choose not to take this easy path, life will be much harder for you.”After the captain did not respond, he was placed under US treasury sanctions. Hook emailed or texted “roughly a dozen” captains in recent months to cajole or scare them out of helping Iran evade oil sanctions.“We have seen the Financial Times article and can confirm that the details are accurate,” the state department said in a statement. “We have conducted extensive outreach to several ship captains as well as shipping companies warning them of the consequences of providing support to a foreign terrorist organization.”The story was retweeted by Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif.“Having failed at piracy, the US resorts to outright blackmail – deliver us Iran’s oil and receive several million dollars or be sanctioned yourself,” Zarif said. He had previously claimed he was threatened with sanctions if he did not go to the White House to meet Trump.Having failed at piracy, the US resorts to outright blackmail—deliver us Iran’s oil and receive several million dollars or be sanctioned yourself.Sounds very similar to the Oval Office invitation I received a few weeks back.It is becoming a pattern.#BTeamGangsters pic.twitter.com/B1oQTLghWZ“Sounds very similar to the Oval Office invitation I received a few weeks back.

We can’t make it any more clear that we are committed to this campaign of maximum pressure and we are not looking to grant any exceptions or waivers,” Hook said.Less than four hours after Hook’s announcement, Rouhani confirmed that Iran would taking another step away from the 2015 deal, in which it had accepted strict curbs on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Trump took the US out of the deal in May 2018 and the US has stepped up sanctions in phases since then.In response, Iran has stopped complying with different elements in the deal, in phases. It has increased its stockpile of low enriched uranium, and boosted the level at which it enriches uranium. On Wednesday, Rouhani announced a third phase, in which Iran would ignore restrictions on its research and development on new models of centrifuges used in the enrichment process.“We will take all necessary steps to protect the Iranian nation’s rights and interests ...

"Donald Trump’s offer to talk peace with Iran sent a shiver of alarm through Israel’s political and security establishment last week. With a too-close-to-call general election looming on 17 September, Benjamin Netanyahu is counting on his hardline anti-Tehran alliance with Washington – and fear of conflict – to win him crucial votes. A North Korea-style Trump tryst with Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, was the prime minister’s “ultimate horror scenario”, one analyst noted.Yet after a recent series of escalatory strikes against Iran-linked forces in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria, Israel’s voters may reflect that if one thing is worse than peace with Iran, it’s war with Iran. Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure” on Tehran, strongly backed by Netanyahu and fellow Tel Aviv hawks, is placing Israel squarely in the firing line. The intensifying confrontation is also sucking in regional states, notably Iraq.Netanyahu constantly brags about his close ties to Trump, taking personal credit for US recognition of Israel’s illegal annexation of the Golan Heights and of Jerusalem as its capital. He encouraged Trump’s decision to renege on the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, which is the primary source of today’s tensions. And he applauded punitive US sanctions – including an oil embargo that swiftly led to clashes in the Gulf.But slavish allegiance comes at a price. The US-Iran confrontation is increasingly endangering Israel’s own security amid evidence that Tehran, wary of direct conflict with US forces, is focusing its military pushback on an attritional campaign by its proxies against the Jewish state. In this respect, Trump and Iran’s leaders have something in common. Neither wants an all-out war, but neither will back down. Both prefer that others fight their battles for them.The recent spate of covert strikes on Iran-linked targets, reportedly ordered by Netanyahu with tacit US backing, appeared to have the shared aim of preventing Tehran equipping Hezbollah in Lebanon and allied Shia forces in Iraq and Syria with precision-guided missiles, drones and other advanced arms. It’s uncertain whether the strikes did lasting damage. But they did provoke a defiant response from Iran, which vowed to redouble its efforts. And together they marked a significant escalation.At this critical moment, Trump’s word plainly cannot be trusted. His impetuous shift at the G7 summit, when he offered a peace summit, did not impress Rouhani, who insisted sanctions be lifted first. Who knows what Trump really intends? Probably nobody, including Trump. What is clear, however, is that the regional security situation is worsening, with Netanyahu’s Israel in danger of becoming the fall guy in the wider, undeclared American “shadow war” with Iran – a war Trump is loth to fight himself.Trump’s Iran policy, swinging indiscriminately like a wrecking ball through the most brittle regions of the Middle East, is taking a toll on Iraq, too, whose government is being pulled both ways. The US is pressing for an end to Iraqi gas and electricity purchases from Iran and closer ties between Baghdad and Washington’s Arab allies. But Tehran continues to exercise considerable influence among the Shia-majority population, not least since the US invasion in 2003.Recent attacks on Iran-linked militias and US installations in Iraq were “clear warnings of how badly escalation between the US and Iran could destabilise Iraq and the region as a whole”, the independent International Crisis Group said last week. “Washington’s ‘maximum pressure’ campaign could wind up placing as much stress – and inflicting as much harm – on its nominal ally Iraq as it does on Iran.”If Isis's undercover resurgence is taking place in the shadow of Trump's Iran fixation, so too is the humanitarian emergency in YemenUnsuccessful attempts by Adel Abdul-Mahdi, Iraq’s prime minister, to rein in pro-Iran militias belonging to the Popular Mobilisation Forces – as demanded by the US – have underlined Iraq’s fragile state. Leaders of the militias, which led the fight to expel Islamic State (Isis) from northern Iraq earlier this summer, refuse to accept Baghdad’s authority while their political allies are demanding the withdrawal of 5,000 remaining US troops.Speaking last week, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UN envoy to Iraq, said US-Iran rivalry threatened to deal a “huge blow” to efforts to rebuild the country following the defeat of Isis. Her warning came amid reports that Isis jihadists are making a comeback in northern and western Iraq and Syria – notwithstanding Trump’s claim to have eliminated the group, and perhaps in part because the US has, on his orders, reduced its military presence there.If Isis’s undercover resurgence is taking place in the shadow of Trump’s Iran fixation, so too is the disaster in Yemen, where an inept Saudi-led campaign to defeat Iran-backed Houthi rebels has triggered a humanitarian emergency. The US has backed Riyadh in the teeth of an international outcry. Yet with the Saudis and the UAE now at odds, and with the Houthis unbowed, this chaotic offshoot of Trump’s proxy war with Iran is further exacerbating regional instability.Of all the blunders Trump has made pursuing his Iran obsession, his failure to intervene to help stop Syria’s civil war is surely the most puzzling. It has led to a situation where, as of today, civilians in Idlib city are trapped by murderous fire in a dreadful echo of previous sieges. It seems he does not care about that. But US inaction has also enabled the Assad regime’s ally, Iran, to establish a permanent military presence on Israel’s doorstep.If Trump is such a great and trusted friend of Israel, why has he tolerated this threatening development? And why is he essentially leaving Israel to cope with it on its own? These are questions that Israelis should consider when Netanyahu – aka “Mr Maximum Pressure” and cheerleader of the Donald J Trump fan club – comes asking for their vote.",Israel risks becoming the

"Australia’s precise role in bringing independence to  Timor-Leste two decades ago continues to simmer as unsettled business at the heart of modern Australian diplomatic and military history.Twenty years is the blink of an eye, of course. And my memories of having a front-row seat on the Australian domestic politics, and the diplomatic and military movements preceding and following the East Timorese autonomy ballot, are vivid.John Howard later pointed to two key moments of his prime ministership about which he is most proud: his government’s response to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre and Australia’s part in East Timor.After the violence diminished, and as the fledgling nation began to govern itself (and even as our spies bugged Dili’s cabinet room to gain unfair advantage in minerals negotiations) Australia has cast itself as the hero of East Timor. The Australian-led Interfet force, ably headed by a later governor general, Peter Cosgrove, showed East Timor – in stark contrast to the morally (and otherwise) venal Indonesia military (TNI), with its orchestration of the pro-integration militias in the province – what a disciplined military force looked like.But the truth was that throughout 1999, as tensions steadily rose in East Timor after Indonesia’s president BJ Habibie (effectively a puppet of the military) announced an act of self-determination, Australia had been anxious to avoid any military peacekeeping deployment and eager to appease Jakarta by downplaying formal, though undeniable, links between TNI and the militias.A raft of declassified US cables and other documents released by the US-based Indonesia and East Timor project further illuminates what the subversive (and in my view, correct) analysis of the times has always shown. And that is: our federal government was eager to downplay its real differences with the US throughout 1999 on the need for an early peacekeeping deployment to end the anticipated and eventual violence, yet it also ultimately relied on the threat of American military muscle to get Jakarta to allow the UN-mandated Interfet into East Timor.Something else the cables make unambiguous: Australian ministers, including Howard and the then foreign minister, Alexander Downer, dismissed suggestions TNI was carefully orchestrating the violence by asserting that only “wild elements” or “rogue elements” were involved, but the US Defence Intelligence Agency was making those connections unambiguous.Australia would have seen much of the same intelligence.Such were the lengths Australia was going to help Jakarta save face – to protect its precious bilateral relationship with Indonesia.The documents also highlight the realpolitik behind Washington’s attempts to preserve military relations with Indonesia, despite its detailed knowledge of the TNI-orchestrated violence and human rights concerns in Congress.“Militia members in east Timor have had unrestricted access to the Indonesian military arsenal, acquiring small arms and hand grenades as supplements to traditional weapons such as machetes and spears,” reads one assessment of the militias, who killed “thousands”.As a Canberra-based foreign affairs and defence correspondent, on 1 August 1999 I reported for the Sunday Age how Australian officials had earlier that year talked down US overtures for an early peacekeeping mission (to avoid the violence that eventually transpired), possibly involving Marines. Downer was outraged. He issued multiple denials about the US discussion of a Marine deployment or of any difference in approach between Australia and Washington.Nine days later I published in the Age the secret Australian cable detailing the meeting between Australian and US officials in which stark differences of potential approach and strategy were highlighted. America had raised the prospect of sending 15,000 US troops into East Timor via Darwin.Late that evening Downer went into the House of Representatives to admit he had not read the secret Australian cable about the US contingency on troops – the same cable in which a key “area of difference” in approach between the US and Australia was spelt out.Downer had sought, in both Australia and the US, to belittle the first article and to challenge the credibility of its authorship. The lengths he went to are made plain in one of the newly released cables by the Indonesia and East Timor project.As pre-ballot tensions were rising in East Timor, US cabling on 2 August 1999 makes it clear that a priority in Canberra for the Australian foreign minister was managing the embarrassment of any suggestion of a US-Australia rift on peacekeeping or anything else.A department of Foreign Affairs and Trade deputy secretary, Neil Mules, told the US embassy in Canberra that the articles “infuriated FM Downer”.“Downer strongly denied their veracity in an August 1 television interview [the day the Sunday Age published the most contentious article] and ordered DFAT to send to the Australian Embassy in Washington for transmission to the Department press points he is using to rebut the articles ... Mules urged that, in responding to press queries about these stories, USG [United States Government] spokesmen make similar points.” International PR while the militias prepared to torch Dili!In his 2004 book, Reluctant Saviour, Clinton Fernandes, a historian and former Australian military intelligence officer who was intimate with the East Timor military operation, wrote: “The problem was that for the whole of 1999, the government had lobbied to keep peacekeepers out [of East Timor]. It now [by August 1999] worked frantically to allow international forces to enter East Timor in order to prevent a political crisis in Australia. Contrary to Howard and Downer’s earlier claims, repeated even today when asked why peacekeepers weren’t sent in before the ballot, four days of diplomatic pressure is all it took for Indonesia to agree to foreign troops.” The critically effective “diplomatic” pressure (which I read, in the light of these now released cables, to be more tantamount to implied US military threat) comes not from Australia, however, but from the US military establishment.The newly released cables make apparent how the US State Department, always carefully managing Washington’s bilateral relations with Jakarta, played a secondary role to US Defense in the critical days before Habibie agreed to allow Interfet into East Timor.While the then Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas, echoing other similarly threatening voices in the Jakarta administration, warned that “nations willing to send peacekeepers to the province would have to shoot their way in”, the US military establishment was figuratively reading the riot act to Indonesian military chief Wiranto.East Timor descended into extreme violence after the 4 September 1999 ballot result, which overwhelmingly favoured independence. The Indonesian military, responsible for security, declared martial law on 6 September, while also aiding the militias. The international community was outraged but needed Indonesian permission before a UN-sanctioned force would be allowed in.The military controlled Habibie. So, plainly, the Indonesian military had to be convinced – perhaps in the only way it understood, with the implied threat of heavy consequence – to capitulate.On 8 September the commander of US forces in the Pacific, Dennis Blair, met Wiranto.He told Wiranto if East Timor’s security continued to deteriorate “it will do potentially irrevocable damage to Indonesia’s relationship with the rest of the world, including the US”. According to the US cable recording the meeting, Blair left his talking points with Wiranto.Point five reads: “The whole world is watching as this tragedy unfolds, and international condemnation of Indonesia has grown to a fever pitch. The window of opportunity in which Indonesia can salvage its relations with the world is rapidly shutting ... I appeal to you to let the international community help Indonesia help itself.”The biggest military gorilla in the South Pacific had beaten its chest.On 12 September Habibie, after a cabinet meeting including Wiranto, announced that Indonesia would accept peacekeepers. Interfet deployed eight days later.The release of these US cables sheds more light on Australia’s true, not always heroic, part in the liberation of East Timor. Just as they will fuel more argument about the history of that combative political, diplomatic, military – and journalistic – time.• Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist",Australia cast itself as the hero of East Timor.

"In early June, a Chinese-owned supertanker abruptly went dark in the Indian Ocean, the tracking system signalling its course apparently deactivated.It was not the first ship to vanish from the monitors. The deactivation of transponders that generate a unique ID issued to ships by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has become increasingly familiar in recent weeks to the companies that track tankers.The Trump administration has stepped up its efforts to track tankers linked to China’s biggest state-run oil company in response to signs that the vessels are helping to transport Iranian crude in defiance of US sanctions against Tehran.“They are hiding their activity,” Samir Madani, the co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, told the New York Times in July. “They don’t want to broadcast the fact that they have been in Iran, evading sanctions. It’s that simple.”The case of the Pacific Bravo, which the US had flagged up as a suspected sanctions breaker, is doubly intriguing. After its unique tracker identifying number disappeared, it reappeared more than a month later attached to a ship listed with a different name, changed in an apparently clumsy effort to disguise it.Other Chinese-owned tankers, several of which are owned by the Bank of Kunlun according to media reports and evidence from tracking companies, have used different tactics. Some have been captured on satellite images interacting with Iranian ships.The events unfolding on the maritime trade routes point to a wider story, of the increasingly complex convergence of two of the Trump administration’s most pressing foreign policy concerns. While Washington seeks to block Iranian oil exports as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign to force Tehran to negotiate over its nuclear and security policies, China – which is locked in its own escalating trade war with the US – appears to be throwing Iran a significant lifeline.Iran for its part has encouraged China. The country’s first vice-president, Eshaq Jahangiri, told a visiting Chinese official recently that Tehran expected Beijing to be more active in buying Iranian oil.“I think the two issues have been converging for a while,” Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst with the thinktank Crisis Group said.. . “The main reason that China initially complied with the US … policy and significantly reduced oil imports from Iran was because it hoped it could be a card that bore some dividends in the trade negotiations. As soon as those talks ran into dead lock, China turned around and resumed oil imports from Iran.”Efforts to evade the sanctions have so far been limited, Vaez and other analysts watching the issue closely say the messaging is clear: China “can make or break the US maximum pressure policy”.China’s change of tack in turn prompted fresh US sanctions in July targeting the Chinese crude oil importer Zhuhai Zhenrong, which accounts for more than 60% of China’s trade with Iran, for “violating US law by accepting crude oil”.Vaez notes, however, that access to Iranian oil is not simply a question of leverage for China, but reflects its long-term strategic aim not to be complicit in US moves it fears may lead to regime change in Iran.“China has a complex calculation regarding Iran. It is the only oil-rich country where the US does not have a foothold. From the point of view of China’s energy needs, Iran is very important,” he said. “But on the other hand China has bigger fish to fry with the US with trade negotiations and it needs to balance relations with other oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia.”Sanam Vakil, a senior researcher at Chatham House, believes the subterfuges currently involved reflect a desire by both China and Iran to avoid an overt confrontation over the issue, as Tehran becomes ever more “creative” about its oil exports.For Vakil, one of the key takeaways has been the Trump administration’s inability to manage the overlapping crises it has fuelled. “It’s unfortunate for US foreign policy that it has so many interconnected crises. It’s impossible for the US government to meet all of of its objectives,” she said.Vaez echoes the sentiment, adding that Chinese imports of Iranian oil may also have discreet support in European capitals still committed to keeping the Iran nuclear deal alive despite Washington’s unilateral withdrawal.“I’m not sure the Trump administration has the bandwidth or the strategic understanding to connect all these dots. That’s why its been own worst enemy. Too many of its main files, including North Korea and Iran, are dependent on how the Trump administration treats China.“In practice, however, this is an administration which, when offered the opportunity to fight too many fires at same time, will jump at it.”",Why is China hiding its oil tankers from US trackers?,2019-08-29/05:00:40,in early june a chinese owned supertanker abruptly went dark in the indian ocean the tracking system signalling its course apparently deactivated it was not the first ship to vanish from the monitors the deactivation of transponders that generate a unique id issued to ships by the international maritime organisation imo has become increasingly familiar in recent weeks to the companies that track tankers the trump administration has stepped up its efforts to track tankers linked to china s biggest state run oil company in response to signs that the vessels are helping to transport iranian crude in defiance of us sanctions against tehran they are hiding their activity samir madani the co founder of tankertrackers com told the new york times in july they don t want to broadcast the fact that they have been in iran evading sanctions it s that simple the case of the pacific bravo which the us had flagged up as a suspected sanctions breaker is doubly intriguing after its unique tracker identifying number disappeared it reappeared more than a month later attached to a ship listed with a different name changed in an apparently clumsy effort to disguise it other chinese owned tankers several of which are owned by the bank of kunlun according to media reports and evidence from tracking companies have used different tactics some have been captured on satellite images interacting with iranian ships the events unfolding on the maritime trade routes point to a wider story of the increasingly complex convergence of two of the trump administration s most pressing foreign policy concerns while washington seeks to block iranian oil exports as part of a maximum pressure campaign to force tehran to negotiate over its nuclear and security policies china which is locked in its own escalating trade war with the us appears to be throwing iran a significant lifeline iran for its part has encouraged china the country s first vice president eshaq jahangiri told a visiting chinese official recently that tehran expected beijing to be more active in buying iranian oil i think the two issues have been converging for a while ali vaez an iran analyst with the thinktank crisis group said the main reason that china initially complied with the us policy and significantly reduced oil imports from iran was because it hoped it could be a card that bore some dividends in the trade negotiations as soon as those talks ran into dead lock china turned around and resumed oil imports from iran efforts to evade the sanctions have so far been limited vaez and other analysts watching the issue closely say the messaging is clear china can make or break the us maximum pressure policy china s change of tack in turn prompted fresh us sanctions in july targeting the chinese crude oil importer zhuhai zhenrong which accounts for more than  of china s trade with iran for violating us law by accepting crude oil vaez notes however that access to iranian oil is not simply a question of leverage for china but reflects its long term strategic aim not to be complicit in us moves it fears may lead to regime change in iran china has a complex calculation regarding iran it is the only oil rich country where the us does not have a foothold from the point of view of china s energy needs iran is very important he said but on the other hand china has bigger fish to fry with the us with trade negotiations and it needs to balance relations with other oil rich countries like saudi arabia sanam vakil a senior researcher at chatham house believes the subterfuges currently involved reflect a desire by both china and iran to avoid an overt confrontation over the issue as tehran becomes ever more creative about its oil exports for vakil one of the key takeaways has been the trump administration s inability to manage the overlapping crises it has fuelled it s unfortunate for us foreign policy that it has so many interconnected crises it s impossible for the us government to meet all of of its objectives she said vaez echoes the sentiment adding that chinese imports of iranian oil may also have discreet support in european capitals still committed to keeping the iran nuclear deal alive despite washington s unilateral withdrawal i m not sure the trump administration has the bandwidth or the strategic understanding to connect all these dots that s why its been own worst enemy too many of its main files including north korea and iran are dependent on how the trump administration treats china in practice however this is an administration which when offered the opportunity to fight too many fires at same time will jump at it ,Iran Sanctions,0.181523114
"Iran has sentenced a British-Iranian man to 12 years in prison after accusing him of spying for Israel, while upholding the 10-year sentence of another UK resident.A spokesman for the Iranian judiciary, Gholamhossein Esmaili, said on Tuesday that Anousheh Ashouri – the latest Iranian national with a western passport to be detained in Iran – had been sentenced to 12 years for ties to Israel’s Mossad spy agency.Ashouri’s sentence included 10 years for allegedly feeding information to Israeli intelligence and two years for receiving €33,000 (£30,000) in illicit funds from the country. He was ordered to pay the same amount in fines.A Foreign Office spokesperson said the UK was supporting Ashouri’s family and the embassy in Tehran was continuing to request consular access. The spokesperson said the FCO urged Iran to allow all dual nationals detained in Iran to be reunited with their families.Meanwhile an appeals court upheld a 10-year prison sentence against Aras Amiri, an Iranian national and British Council worker. Amiri was living in London when she was arrested in 2018 during a trip to Iran to visit relatives.Last week Amiri’s fiance, James Tyson, accused the UK government of being “utterly blind to their responsibility” to try to secure her release. He said British officials had initially claimed they could not help Amiri because she was an Iranian citizen.Amiri, who worked as an artistic affairs officer for the British Council, was arrested last year when she was visiting her ailing grandmother in Iran. In May she was sentenced to prison on spying charges after she claimed she had refused to become an informant for Iran’s intelligence service.Esmaili said she had been identified “because of her cultural infiltration in society through arts and her widespread activities”.Tyson said his fiance had become close to her cellmate, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Iranian-British citizen serving a five-year sentence for alleged spying.“They’re sort of housemates in many ways. They’re very supportive of each other … telling stories, sharing books they have and cooking together,” he said. “In many ways it’s good that they could have each other, actually, through this time.”Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested by Iranian authorities in 2016 as she was leaving Tehran. An Iranian national, Ali Johari, was also sentenced to 12 years in jail on Tuesday after being accused of spying for Israel. Esmaili said Johari had “widespread connections with Mossad” and had met “various elements linked to the Zionists”.The verdicts came amid tensions between Iran and Britain, a US ally, over the seizure of oil tankers in recent weeks. An Iranian tanker was seized off the British overseas territory of Gibraltar on 4 July on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions.That vessel has been released but Iran continues to hold a British-flagged tanker it seized in the Gulf on 19 July for breaking “international maritime rules”.A statement from the FCO said: “The treatment of all dual nationals detained in Iran is a priority and we raise their cases at the most senior levels. We urge Iran to let them be reunited with their families.”",Iran: lengthy jail terms for dual national and British Council worker,2019-08-27/12:28:28,iran has sentenced a british iranian man to  years in prison after accusing him of spying for israel while upholding the  year sentence of another uk resident a spokesman for the iranian judiciary gholamhossein esmaili said on tuesday that anousheh ashouri the latest iranian national with a western passport to be detained in iran had been sentenced to  years for ties to israel s mossad spy agency ashouri s sentence included  years for allegedly feeding information to israeli intelligence and two years for receiving     in illicit funds from the country he was ordered to pay the same amount in fines a foreign office spokesperson said the uk was supporting ashouri s family and the embassy in tehran was continuing to request consular access the spokesperson said the fco urged iran to allow all dual nationals detained in iran to be reunited with their families meanwhile an appeals court upheld a  year prison sentence against aras amiri an iranian national and british council worker amiri was living in london when she was arrested in  during a trip to iran to visit relatives last week amiri s fiance james tyson accused the uk government of being utterly blind to their responsibility to try to secure her release he said british officials had initially claimed they could not help amiri because she was an iranian citizen amiri who worked as an artistic affairs officer for the british council was arrested last year when she was visiting her ailing grandmother in iran in may she was sentenced to prison on spying charges after she claimed she had refused to become an informant for iran s intelligence service esmaili said she had been identified because of her cultural infiltration in society through arts and her widespread activities tyson said his fiance had become close to her cellmate nazanin zaghari ratcliffe the iranian british citizen serving a five year sentence for alleged spying they re sort of housemates in many ways they re very supportive of each other telling stories sharing books they have and cooking together he said in many ways it s good that they could have each other actually through this time zaghari ratcliffe who worked for the thomson  foundation was arrested by iranian authorities in  as she was leaving tehran an iranian national ali johari was also sentenced to  years in jail on tuesday after being accused of spying for israel esmaili said johari had widespread connections with mossad and had met various elements linked to the zionists the verdicts came amid tensions between iran and britain a us ally over the seizure of oil tankers in recent weeks an iranian tanker was seized off the british overseas territory of gibraltar on  july on suspicion of shipping oil to syria in breach of eu sanctions that vessel has been released but iran continues to hold a british flagged tanker it seized in the gulf on  july for breaking international maritime rules a statement from the fco said the treatment of all dual nationals detained in iran is a priority and we raise their cases at the most senior levels we urge iran to let them be reunited with their families ,Iran Sanctions,0.215485319
"Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has made a surprise appearance in Biarritz meeting Emmanuel Macron, in the midst of a G7 summit where western policy towards Iran has been one of the most contentious issues.On Sunday evening, Zarif posted a picture on Twitter of his meeting with the French president and the foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, reportedly in the office of the Biarritz mayor, across the road from a building where G7 leaders had been meeting. The Iranian foreign minister said he had also provided a briefing for British and German officials.“Road ahead is difficult. But worth trying,” Zarif wrote, before flying out of Biarritz on Sunday evening.A senior French diplomat confirmed that Zarif had been invited to Biarritz for talks as part of Macron’s diplomatic initiative aimed at defusing tensions in the Gulf and reviving diplomacy with Iran. Zarif also met Macron in Paris on Friday.“We have been trying for several months to defuse tensions and create a pause for useful negotiations,” the French diplomat said. He added that the French were not acting as mediators for the US, and it was not the intention “at this stage” to bring together the Iranians and Americans.The diplomat said Zarif was not formally a guest of the G7 but that Macron had informed other leaders at the summit, including Donald Trump.“The president had a conversation yesterday with all the G7 leaders and clearly the information was circulated,” the diplomat said. “Our diplomats are working in full transparency with the United States.”Asked for his reaction to Zarif’s arrival, Trump said only “no comment”. The US treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin suggested the US president would not rule out a meeting.“The president has said before that to the extent Iran wants to sit down and negotiate, he would not set pre-conditions to those negotiations,” Mnuchin said.Earlier on Sunday, Macron had floated a plan at the summit to defuse rising tensions in the Gulf by partially lifting the US oil embargo on Iran in exchange for Tehran’s return to full compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement restricting its nuclear programme.The French diplomat said that once tensions had been reduced, an opening would be created for talks on other issues, including regional conflicts and Iran’s ballistic missile programme.Donald Trump was noncommittal. Asked for his reaction, the US president said he had not discussed the proposal with Macron. However, European officials confirmed Macron had talked about leading a diplomatic initiative on Iran during a Saturday night dinner of G7 leaders.Sitting alongside the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who made an abortive attempt to mediate between the US and Iran in June, Trump said: “I also support Prime Minister Abe’s outreach, because he’s also speaking to Iran … We’ll do our own outreach. But you can’t stop people from talking. If they want to talk, they can talk.”US officials insisted the US policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran was working and had international support.“The G7 countries all agreed the president’s maximum pressure campaign on Iran is having an impact, and that it should continue,” an official familiar with the talks said.Trump is accompanied in Biarritz by his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, who has opposed any easing of the “maximum pressure” campaign, intended to force its government to halt nuclear activities such as uranium enrichment entirely.Under the 2015 joint comprehensive programme of action (JCPOA), Iran accepted strict curbs on its activities in return for sanctions relief.Under the joint comprehensive plan of action signed in 2015, Iran is only permitted to produce low-enriched uranium. This is uranium that has a concentration of 3%-4% of the isotope U-235. This isotype is a fissile material, which is capable of sustaining a nuclear fission chain reaction.At this low level of enrichment, it can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. Iran is permitted to stockpile 300kg of it, at an enrichment level capped at 3.67%.A bomb needs uranium that is up to 90% enriched. Iran’s atomic energy agency has said production of enriched uranium has been quadrupled. The more that uranium is enriched, the faster it is to enrich it further.Iran argues that it is no longer bound by the cap because of the withdrawal of the US from the agreement, and the reimposition of economic sanctions Donald Trump.Read more: Iran's uranium enrichment programme: the science explainedTrump withdrew the US from the agreement in May 2018 and has since steadily increased sanctions against Iran. In response, Iran has begun gradually to break out of the JCPOA limits, increasing its stock of low enriched uranium for example, and raising the level at which it enriches uranium. Iranian forces have also stepped up the harassment of oil shipping going through the strait of Hormuz.“We think it is necessary to usefully contribute towards creating conditions for a defusing of tensions and create an opening for talks not only to get Iran back into compliance with the JCPOA but to break the impasse threatening regional stability,” a French diplomat said.The other parties to the JCPOA – the UK, France, Germany, Russia, China and the EU – have urged both the US and Iran to return to the agreement.French officials were optimistic they could persuade the US that Macron’s plan was a better alternative to a drift towards a new Middle East conflict. They say it would create a breathing space for talks about issues such as Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its involvement in regional conflicts. Zarif, who held talks with Macron in Paris on the eve of the summit, has said the French initiative is moving “in the right direction”.Such diplomacy could face resistance from Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and hardliners in the powerful Revolutionary Guards, who insist the missile programme and Iran’s regional role are not negotiable.",G7 summit: Iran foreign minister makes surprise

"An oil tanker at the centre of a six-week diplomatic row between Britain and Iran is to be released from Gibraltar after Tehran promised that its cargo worth $140m would no longer be transported to Syria.The territory’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, said he had agreed to let the vessel go after he had received a written assurance from Iran, but admitted his decision could yet be overturned by a surprise last minute US legal challenge.Iran had promised that the final destination of the tanker Grace 1 “would not be an entity that is subject to European Union sanctions” such as Syria, Picardo said in a statement. That meant there were “no longer any reasonable grounds for the continued legal detention”, he added. Royal Marines seized the vessel off the shores of Gibraltar on 4 July. A court in the territory endorsed his decision to release the vessel, which is carrying 2.1m barrels of Iranian oil worth £116m.Tensions flared after the incident, with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards seizing the British-flagged Stena Impero a fortnight later, and Britain sending out a second warship to the Gulf to offer greater protection to merchant shipping.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.

Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.Picardo acknowledged that the US Department of Justice had indicated it was minded to challenge the decision and said mutual legal assistance authorities would make “an objective, legal determination of that request”.Trump administration officials had earlier told the Guardian the seizure request was consistent with wider efforts to intensify the effects of western economic sanctions on Iran as well as Syria.A US official said the tanker case was significant because it was both an Iranian oil export and, in the judgment of the UK government, a Syrian oil import. “We have an interest in the disruption of both of those, both for our overarching Iran policy and our Syria policy,” the official said.Gibraltar detained the Grace 1 because it was believed to be heading to Syria. Bashar al-Assad’s government has been subject to EU sanctions since the early stages of the country’s civil war. The EU does not sanction Iranian oil exports.Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, accused the US of “having failed to accomplish its objectives through its economic terrorism”. It had “attempted to abuse the legal system to steal our property on the high seas”, he said.British officials said they were notified in advance by the US of the Department of Justice’s intention to challenge the release of the tanker, but they would not spell out when that had occurred.It is not clear whether the US national security adviser, John Bolton, raised the subject when he visited London on Monday and Tuesday and met the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and other cabinet ministers.Bolton had previously been following the topic closely. The senior official had hailed the seizure of the Grace 1 as “excellent news” when it originally took place, and praised the UK for agreeing to work with the US to help safeguard merchant shipping in the Gulf earlier this month.The Foreign Office said it noted the assurances given by Iran that the Grace 1 would not proceed to Syria. “Iran must abide by the assurances they have provided. We will not stand by and allow Iran, or anyone, to bypass vital EU sanctions on a regime that has deployed chemical weapons against its own people,” a spokesperson said.Relations between Iran and the west have been deteriorating since Washington pulled out of an international agreement curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme and reimposed economic sanctions.The UK, France and Germany have been trying to keep the deal alive, but under the pressure of economic sanctions, Iran has been gradually pursuing a policy of defiance, sabotaging shipping in the Gulf and increasing the enrichment levels of its uranium stockpiles in breach of the treaty.During his trip to the UK, Bolton made further diplomatic efforts to steer a post-Brexit UK further away from Europe on a range of issues including the Iran nuclear deal and the role of the Chinese technology firm Huawei.Bolton is hoping that a Johnson administration will gradually adopt a foreign policy on Iran more independent of its two former EU partners Germany and France after Brexit, and closer to the policy of maximum economic pressure on Tehran imposed by Donald Trump.",Gibraltar to release oil tanker at centre of Iran row pending

"John Bolton doesn’t do free trade. He does regime change in countries such as North Korea, Venezuela and Cuba. He does military interventions, notoriously in Afghanistan in 2001, Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011. He does punitive sanctions and embargoes. He does spite.Bolton’s speciality is tearing up multilateral agreements, such as the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, which he claims undermine US national sovereignty. For the same reason, he reviles the very idea of the UN, international law and the international criminal court (ICC).So when Bolton, whose actual job is national security adviser to Donald Trump, came to London this week to meet Boris Johnson and senior ministers, the real focus of his visit, despite the Whitehall briefings, was not on a post-Brexit bilateral trade deal. It was on regime change in the UK. Bolton, a lifelong neoconservative ideologue, Muslim-baiting thinktanker and erstwhile Fox News commentator, does not give a hormone-filled sausage or chlorine-rinsed chicken wing for a free trade pact, fair or otherwise. Midwest wheat and soya exports are not his thing. What Bolton really does care about is exploiting the UK’s recent governmental upheaval, which almost anywhere else would be described as a rightwing coup, to America’s, and Trump’s, advantage. In short, the former colonies are out to colonise the UK.Supposed American trade concessions will be tied to extraneous US foreign policy objectivesBolton has three main aims. The first is purely transactional, in keeping with the Trump administration’s arm-twisting style. Although he says the US is content to wait until after Brexit on 31 October before pressing its demands, it’s already pretty clear what they will be. If Johnson wants a quickie sectoral trade deal on, say, the car industry, then Bolton’s price could be the UK’s withdrawal from the hard-won, US-trashed 2015 Iran nuclear agreement and the abandonment of fellow signatories France and Germany. In truth, Johnson and Dominic Raab, his neophyte foreign secretary, are already halfway down this road, having agreed to join a US-led maritime force in the Gulf rather than support a Europe-wide initiative initially proposed by Jeremy Hunt.This U-turn is rightly seen in Tehran as evidence that the UK is falling in behind the aggressive, failing Trump-Bolton “maximum pressure” campaign. The risk of war with Iran is acute. The costs would be incalculable. But Brexit Britain, it seems, can be bought – a nation of shopkeepers after all, and mercenary to boot.Other supposed American trade concessions will be similarly tied to extraneous US foreign policy objectives, although there will be a face-saving pretence that this is not so. In the name of helping “our British friends”, the US will seek support in ostracising China’s Huawei telecoms giant and, maybe, backing for its trade war with Beijing. The list of politely framed, slightly menacing American “requests” could go on and on. How about British acquiescence in Israel’s proposed, Trump-backed annexation of West Bank settlements, in defiance of UN resolutions hitherto backed by London? That could be seen as helpful, even necessary, in the UK’s new world of weakness.Bolton’s enthusiasm for the “incredibly valuable” role that an “independent” UK could play in Nato, a regular target of Trump’s anti-European spleen, suggests an ever-greater degree of subservience. Will the price of market access soon include uncritical support for Trump’s renewed nuclear arms race with Russia and China, now he has scrapped the intermediate nuclear forces (INF) treaty? And whatever you do, chaps, don’t mention the words “climate crisis”. That sends Trump nuts.The dire prospect raised by Bolton’s gleeful, hopefully premature Whitehall victory tour is one of the UK’s foreign and security policy outsourced to Washington, subordinated to the Trump-Bolton global agenda, and in hock to rightwing nationalist-populist ideology. Brexiteers promised a return of sovereignty. What’s coming is a sellout – a fire sale at the altar of America First.Bolton’s second aim is to drive a wedge between the UK and Europe, and then use it as a sort of Afghan war-style forward operating base from which to disrupt, subvert and weaken the EU, whose very existence offends him. Throughout the Brexit negotiations, the official UK position has always been that whatever future EU trading relationship emerged, close cooperation on foreign and security policy would be maintained wherever possible. Yet that sort of continuity doesn’t suit Bolton’s purposes. For him, regime change means root-and-branch destruction of the status quo. If the UK, ever more beholden to the US for its daily bread, can be used to foil Emmanuel Macron’s ideas about integrated European defence, or undermine EU regulations covering digital multinationals, so much the better.On this trajectory, the UK’s new best friends in Europe will not be Angela Merkel or Donald Tusk but Trump’s far-right chums, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Italy’s Matteo Salvini.Freed from EU shackles, the UK, Bolton said, “will be pursuing UK national interests as it sees them”. For UK in that sentence, read US-approved. The UK will not even enjoy the equivalent position of one of the 50 US states, whose rights are protected by the federal constitution. On offer, if and when Johnson caves, is the status of mere satrapy – a tame, timid outpost of the American empire.For this is the third Bolton aim: to enlist a radically repurposed and realigned UK in pursuit of his singular vision of American global hegemony, of the truly exceptional nation whose power and dominion know no limits and whose enemies quail before its unrivalled might. In Bolton’s imperious worldview, the pre-eminent, muscular and righteous US republic rises above all others, sustained by the ultra-conservative, libertarian, populist-nationalist preconceptions and prejudices that only those with commensurately tiny minds can seriously entertain.Never mind that the shining city on a hill is now “an ugly pile of rubble”, as the US commentator, Maureen Dowd, sadly noted at the weekend. This is the recycled project for the new American century to which Johnson and his blindly buccaneering Brexiteers, trading time-honoured principles for quick bucks, are about to sign up. It will not make us prosperous or safe. It will make us ashamed.• Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",John Bolton doesn’t want a trade deal with the UK – he wants to colonise us,2019-08-13/16:20:57,john bolton doesn t do free

"Confusion swirled over a possible breakthrough in the tanker standoff in the Middle East on Tuesday after Gibraltar scotched Iranian media reports that an Iranian tanker was due to be released.The Fars news agency said that Grace 1, seized by British Royal Marines off Gibraltar on suspicion that it was taking 2.1m barrels of oil to Syria in breach of an EU arms embargo, was going to be released on Tuesday evening. The report cited Gibraltar authorities, but a source for the government of the British Mediterranean territory told Reuters it was not correct.The seizure of the boat on 4 July led to reprisals by Iran, including the capture of the British-flagged Stena Impero. Both incidents fuelled worsening hostilities between Iran and the west that began when Washington pulled out of an international agreement curbing Iran’s nuclear programme last year and reimposed economic sanctions.A court in Gibraltar is to decide the fate of the ship on Thursday, when an order for its detention lapses.Britain had said there would be serious consequences if Iran did not release the British-flagged tanker, and behind the scenes there have been negotiations on how to resolve the dual crisis. Formally, the Foreign Office and Iran say there is no link between the two boat seizures. On Tuesday the Foreign Office said the ship’s status was a matter for Gibraltar.The Stena Impero’s owners have said its 23 personnel on board have been properly treated by the Iranians since their capture.The initial British capture of Grace 1 was always regarded as controversial, both politically and legally.The Foreign Office faced private criticism that its decision to back a move to enforce EU sanctions in such a novel way was always likely to lead to an Iranian reaction just as the Iran nuclear deal was coming under such pressure. Iran, responding to the mounting US economic sanctions, has withdrawn from aspects of the nuclear deal covering the limits on enriching uranium and its stockpiles of uranium.It was the first time the UK had enforced the EU embargo on oil sales to Syria in this way.The UK acknowledged it had acted after pressure from the US, including intelligence that the boat was carrying oil bound for the regime of President Assad. It was also a surprise to the UK that Grace 1 strayed from international into Gibraltarian waters, so making the capture of the ship possible.There have also been legal question marks over whether the seizure was compliant with international law, since Iran was not subject to the EU-imposed embargo, but many experts said the port to which the ship was bound was a sanctioned entity, and therefore the UK act was lawful under EU law.Talks between Iranian officials and the Foreign Office conducted in London last month failed to resolve the crisis after the UK demanded assurances that the ship’s cargo would not proceed to Syria. Iran insisted that it had a right to sell oil to Syria or any other country it wished.The US has separately threatened to impose sanctions on any country that imports oil from Iran. Oil exports are vital to the Iranian economy and it has responded to the growing stranglehold by taking a more aggressive posture on the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway that Iran regards as its preserve.If the breakthrough does happen, it will change some of the atmosphere around the nuclear deal ahead of the G7 summit of world economic powers in Biarritz at the end of the month. The rival European and US approaches to the Iranian regime are likely to be central to the summit.",Gibraltar denies it is about to free captured Iranian tanker,2019-08-13/14:46:01,confusion swirled over a possible breakthrough in the tanker standoff in the middle east on tuesday after gibraltar scotched iranian media reports that an iranian tanker was due to be released the fars news agency said that grace  seized by british royal marines off gibraltar on suspicion that it was taking  m barrels of oil to syria in breach of an eu arms embargo was going to be released on tuesday evening the report cited gibraltar authorities but a source for the government of the british mediterranean territory told  it was not correct the seizure of the boat on  july led to reprisals by iran including the capture of the british flagged stena impero both incidents fuelled worsening hostilities between iran and the west that began when washington pulled out of an international agreement curbing iran s nuclear programme last year and reimposed economic sanctions a court in gibraltar is to decide the fate of the ship on thursday when an order for its detention lapses britain had said there would be serious consequences if iran did not release the british flagged tanker and behind the scenes there have been negotiations on how to resolve the dual crisis formally the foreign office and iran say there is no link between the two boat seizures on tuesday the foreign office said the ship s status was a matter for gibraltar the stena impero s owners have said its  personnel on board have been properly treated by the iranians since their capture the initial british capture of grace  was always regarded as controversial both politically and legally the foreign office faced private criticism that its decision to back a move to enforce eu sanctions in such a novel way was always likely to lead to an iranian reaction just as the iran nuclear deal was coming under such pressure iran responding to the mounting us economic sanctions has withdrawn from aspects of the nuclear deal covering the limits on enriching uranium and its stockpiles of uranium it was the first time the uk had enforced the eu embargo on oil sales to syria in this way the uk acknowledged it had acted after pressure from the us including intelligence that the boat was carrying oil bound for the regime of president assad it was also a surprise to the uk that grace  strayed from international into gibraltarian waters so making the capture of the ship possible there have also been legal question marks over whether the seizure was compliant with international law since iran was not subject to the eu imposed embargo but many experts said the port to which the ship was bound was a sanctioned entity and therefore the uk act was lawful under eu law talks between iranian officials and the foreign office conducted in london last month failed to resolve the crisis after the uk demanded assurances that the ship s cargo would not proceed to syria iran insisted that it had a right to sell oil to syria or any other country it wished the us has separately threatened to impose sanctions on any country that imports oil from iran oil exports are vital to the iranian economy and it has responded to the growing stranglehold by taking a more aggressive posture on the strait of hormuz the waterway that iran regards as its preserve if the breakthrough does happen it will change some of the atmosphere around the nuclear deal ahead of the g summit of world economic powers in biarritz at the end of the month the rival european and us approaches to the iranian regime are likely to be central to the summit ,Iran Sanctions,0.273719549
"John Bolton, the hawkish US national security adviser, has started two days of meetings in London with key figures in Boris Johnson’s government as the US pitches to steer a post-Brexit UK further away from Europe on a range of issues including trade, the Iran nuclear deal and the role of the Chinese technology firm Huawei.Bolton is the most senior Trump official to visit since Johnson became prime minister, and the move is seen to have increased the chances of the UK leaving the EU on 31 October without a withdrawal agreement – a position more in line with the Brexit policy favoured by the US president.Bolton will be testing how the UK intends to position itself as a country “freeing itself of the shackles of the EU” at the G7 summit to behosted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Biarritz later this month.The summit, the first opportunity for Trump to meet Johnson since he became prime minister, is likely to be dominated by transatlantic disagreements over Iran and the value of multilateralism. In an admission that the UK may be edging closer to the US, Macron is not looking for a declaration signed by all seven countries, but coalitions of the willing on specific subjects instead.Bolton is hoping that a Johnson administration will gradually adopt a foreign policy on Iran more independent of its two former EU partners Germany and France after Brexit, and closer to the policy of maximum economic pressure on Tehran imposed by Trump.His visit is a chance to test how far Johnson’s premiership is leading to tangible initial changes in UK security policy. If Britain were abandon the concept of a European maritime security force in the Gulf, for example, that could be seen as a prelude to a deeper shift on Iran.The Foreign Office has so far insisted that the US policy of sanctions strengthens hardliners in Tehran, weakens moderates ahead of elections and increases the chances that Iran will seek a nuclear bomb, triggering a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.Johnson was willing to disagree with Trump on Iranian strategy as foreign secretary when the US withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal, but with Brexit imminent and the prospect of a US-UK trade deal to be done, he will be looking to curry favour with Trump.Underlining Bolton’s interest in a no-deal Brexit, he is slated to meet Bernard Jenkin, Bill Cash and Iain Duncan Smith, three veteran supporters of Brexit outside the Johnson administration.An official travelling with Bolton said Trump had wanted to work with Theresa May on a trade deal but her government “didn’t want do it”. “This government does. We’re very happy about it,” the official told reporters. Trump believes that “when it comes to trade negotiations the EU is worse than China, only smaller”, the official said.On Monday, Bolton is meeting the UK cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, Johnson’s senior adviser, Edward Lister, and the chancellor, Sajid Javid.On Tuesday he will meet the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, the Brexit secretary, Steven Barclay, and Michael Gove, who is responsible for no-deal Brexit planning.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, met administration officials on a visit to Washington last week that partly focused on patching up relations after the leak of scathing memos from the outgoing US ambassador, Sir Kim Darroch.US officials said the details and timescale of any US-UK trade deal would be worked out by the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and Truss. The visit will include an exploration of options such as wrapping key sectors like finance into bilateral agreements that can be reached more quickly.Bolton is expected to press the UK to revise its plans to join a European-led maritime protection force in the Gulf rather than join the US-led force Operation Sentinel proposed by Washington.The UK has stressed that the US and EU forces would coordinate their work, but it was notable that in one of his last acts as foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt proposed an independent European force to protect European shipping in the Gulf.Raab has since hinted at a change in British policy, saying he is not sure a European force would be viable without US support. The British-flagged vessel Stena Impero, which was seized by Iran on 19 July, remains under Tehran’s control in an act seen as a reprisal for the UK’s seizure of the oil tanker Grace 1 off Gilbraltar on the grounds that it was bound for Syria in breach of an EU embargo.",John Bolton in UK to meet Johnson and Brexit hardliners,2019-08-12/14:05:22,john bolton the hawkish us national security adviser has started two days of meetings in london with key figures in boris johnson s government as the us pitches to steer a post brexit uk further away from europe on a range of issues including trade the iran nuclear deal and the role of the chinese technology firm huawei bolton is the most senior trump official to visit since johnson became prime minister and the move is seen to have increased the chances of the uk leaving the eu on  october without a withdrawal agreement a position more in line with the brexit policy favoured by the us president bolton will be testing how the uk intends to position itself as a country freeing itself of the shackles of the eu at the g summit to behosted by the french president emmanuel macron in biarritz later this month the summit the first opportunity for trump to meet johnson since he became prime minister is likely to be dominated by transatlantic disagreements over iran and the value of multilateralism in an admission that the uk may be edging closer to the us macron is not looking for a declaration signed by all seven countries but coalitions of the willing on specific subjects instead bolton is hoping that a johnson administration will gradually adopt a foreign policy on iran more independent of its two former eu partners germany and france after brexit and closer to the policy of maximum economic pressure on tehran imposed by trump his visit is a chance to test how far johnson s premiership is leading to tangible initial changes in uk security policy if britain were abandon the concept of a european maritime security force in the gulf for example that could be seen as a prelude to a deeper shift on iran the foreign office has so far insisted that the us policy of sanctions strengthens hardliners in tehran weakens moderates ahead of elections and increases the chances that iran will seek a nuclear bomb triggering a nuclear arms race in the middle east johnson was willing to disagree with trump on iranian strategy as foreign secretary when the us withdrew from the  nuclear deal but with brexit imminent and the prospect of a us uk trade deal to be done he will be looking to curry favour with trump underlining bolton s interest in a no deal brexit he is slated to meet bernard jenkin bill cash and iain duncan smith three veteran supporters of brexit outside the johnson administration an official travelling with bolton said trump had wanted to work with theresa may on a trade deal but her government didn t want do it this government does we re very happy about it the official told reporters trump believes that when it comes to trade negotiations the eu is worse than china only smaller the official said on monday bolton is meeting the uk cabinet secretary mark sedwill johnson s senior adviser edward lister and the chancellor sajid javid on tuesday he will meet the defence secretary ben wallace the international trade secretary liz truss the brexit secretary steven barclay and michael gove who is responsible for no deal brexit planning the foreign secretary dominic raab met administration officials on a visit to washington last week that partly focused on patching up relations after the leak of scathing memos from the outgoing us ambassador sir kim darroch us officials said the details and timescale of any us uk trade deal would be worked out by the us trade representative robert lighthizer and truss the visit will include an exploration of options such as wrapping key sectors like finance into bilateral agreements that can be reached more quickly bolton is expected to press the uk to revise its plans to join a european led maritime protection force in the gulf rather than join the us led force operation sentinel proposed by washington the uk has stressed that the us and eu forces would coordinate their work but it was notable that in one of his last acts as foreign secretary jeremy hunt proposed an independent european force to protect european shipping in the gulf raab has since hinted at a change in british policy saying he is not sure a european force would be viable without us support the british flagged vessel stena impero which was seized by iran on  july remains under tehran s control in an act seen as a reprisal for the uk s seizure of the oil tanker grace  off gilbraltar on the grounds that it was bound for syria in breach of an eu embargo ,Iran Sanctions,0.218758315
"﻿Donald Trump is heading into the 2020 elections with no clear-cut foreign policy successes, some dramatic failures and a string of looming crises around the world that could undermine his bid for re-election.For that reason, many expect the president to try to reverse the trend with dramatic interventions around the globe with uncertain outcomes – which will make the next 16 months even more volatile than his presidency so far.Trump has pulled out of nuclear agreements with Iran and Russia but the better deals he predicted seem more remote than ever, and in their absence nuclear weapons proliferation looks likely to accelerate.An effort to oust Nicolás Maduro’s regime in Venezuela in April was a fiasco, and subsequent efforts to strangle the economy have so far showed no sign of achieving their political objective. This week, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, warned that the measures are likely to significantly exacerbate conditions for millions of ordinary Venezuelan. Trump’s proudest diplomatic achievement so far, becoming the first US president to meet a North Korean leader, is looking increasingly hollow, as Kim Jong-un steadily builds up his nuclear arsenal and resumes missile testing.Similarly, Trump’s most significant military win, completing the eradication of the Islamic State caliphate in Syria and Iraq, has been tarnished by a Pentagon inspector general report this week saying that Isis had “solidified its insurgent capabilities in Iraq and was resurging in Syria”.In Afghanistan, the administration claims to be close to an agreement with the Taliban, clearing the way for a major withdrawal of US forces by the end of Trump’s first term, but a spike in violence, with 1,500 civilian casualties in July alone, has underlined the tenuous nature of such negotiations.What is interesting is that in every one of these issues, Trump saw a domestic political benefitForeign policy issues rarely play a leading role in US presidential elections, but Trump has relentlessly portrayed himself as uniquely able to strike deals with foreign leaders and bring US troops home. And some foreign crises have a direct domestic result. The absence so far of the promised deal with China, the imposition of tariffs and the prospect of a worsening trade war will directly hit consumers and producers.“What is interesting is that in every one of these issues, Trump saw a domestic political benefit: getting tough on China, Iran, on Venezuela, with voters in Florida in mind, the spectacle of meeting Kim Jong-un,” said Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama’s speechwriter and foreign policy adviser. “But whatever short-term benefit there was has been more than eclipsed by the long-term mess he has created.”Trump appears to be aware of his foreign policy deficit as he barrels towards full campaign mode, and is seeking to address it.In the short term, that has amounted to redefining success.In relation to North Korea, that means playing down the original claim that diplomacy with Kim would lead to nuclear disarmament. The emphasis instead has been on Pyongyang’s moratorium on nuclear and missile tests. When North Korea stepped up short range missile launches, the red line was shifted to a block on intercontinental missiles.The “maximum pressure” strategy against Iran was intended to change the Tehran government’s behaviour in the region, ending uranium enrichment, making it pull back from involvement, directly or through proxies, in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, and persuade it open new negotiations with the US, outside the multilateral 2015 deal, that Trump abandoned.By those measures, so far the strategy is backfiring. Iran is stepping up its nuclear programme beyond the limits of the 2015 deal. It has become more aggressive in the Persian Gulf, harassing shipping, and it has rejected several overtures from intermediaries offering talks with Trump.However, the Trump administration argues it is making gains by cutting down Tehran’s disposable cash.“We have denied the regime tens of billions of dollars in revenue they would otherwise spend on strengthening the regime and strengthening their proxies,” said Brian Hook, the US Iran envoy, adding that consequently the Iranian defence budget in 2020 is 28% down on the previous year.“This is the necessary foreign policy to change the paradigm of Iran’s destabilizing efforts in the Middle East. There’s no other way to accomplish this … As Cicero said, money is the sinews of war. And Iran does not have the money that it used to.”It is unclear whether tactic of lowering the success threshold will carry Trump through to the election in November next year, as North Korea fires off ever more provocative missiles tests, and Iran breaks free of its nuclear constraints.Trump’s other option would be retake the initiative with bold action. That could take military form, though that would be the last resort. A new conflict on the Korean peninsula or the Persian Gulf would be disastrous, electorally and otherwise. The president was “cocked and loaded” to strike Iran in June but called off the operation at the last moment, when he was warned it could cost him his second term. His instinct is to make an eye-catching deal. He has signaled his interest in another summit with Kim – jubilantly announcing the arrival of another “very beautiful” letter from the North Korean dictator - where he could offer a partial easing of sanctions for the destruction of some of North Korea’s nuclear weapons infrastructure. Trump’s attempt to talk directly to Iran’s leadership have thus far been rebuffed, but September’s UN general assembly offers another opportunity for a meeting with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. It would probably take a significant easing of economic pressure to pull that off.Trump may just think it is worth the risk, even if entailed the departure of his ultra-hawk national security adviser, John Bolton.A partial trade deal might also be engineered with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in which China restarts imports of US agricultural products in return perhaps for the easing of ban on dealing with the Huawei tech giant.“I’m guessing from what the president has said in the past he’s willing to give more than other people [in his team] are willing to give, but that’s usually the case since he’s transactional and he wants a deal,” said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “So maybe there could be a prospect for some small deal that emerges in September.”Trump will be trying to grab the headlines and portray himself as a leaderTrump could seize any such agreement and proclaim it deal of the century. The question would be whether Pyongyang, Tehran or Beijing is prepared to play along, and that depends on whether they see an interest in helping the president win a second term.“It is remarkable how much agency these countries have,” Rhodes said. “Certainly, Iran, China and North Korea will be aware that anything they do will have an impact on the elections … They have a vote.”Kim has good reason to assist a president who has showered recognition and praise on its leader, so could well consider concessions. Tehran would most certainly like to see him gone, and will be unwilling to help stage diplomatic photo ops. Beijing too is showing signs it would rather not face a second Trump term.In the faces of such challenges from abroad, Trump has demonstrated a willingness to take brinksmanship ever closer to the edge of an all out trade war, or a shooting war.“Trump will be trying to grab the headlines and portray himself as a leader,” said Julianne Smith, a former senior national security official in the Obama White House. “We will see a series of rash and reckless moves and a lot more drama in the next 18 months. So hold on to your hats.”",Why Trump’s 'maximum pressure' foreign policy yields minimum results,2019-08-11/07:30:37, donald trump is heading into the  elections with no clear cut foreign policy

with voters in florida in mind the spectacle of meeting kim jong un said ben rhodes barack obama s speechwriter and foreign policy adviser but whatever short term benefit there was has been more than eclipsed by the long term mess he has created trump appears to be aware of his foreign policy deficit as he barrels towards full campaign mode and is seeking to address it in the short term that has amounted to redefining success in relation to north korea that means playing down the original claim that diplomacy with kim would lead to nuclear disarmament the emphasis instead has been on pyongyang s moratorium on nuclear and missile tests when north korea stepped up short range missile launches the red line was shifted to a block on intercontinental missiles the maximum pressure strategy against iran was intended to change the tehran government s behaviour in the region ending uranium enrichment making it pull back from involvement directly or through proxies in syria iraq and yemen and persuade it open new negotiations with the us outside the multilateral  deal that trump abandoned by those measures so far the strategy is backfiring iran is stepping up its nuclear programme beyond the limits of the  deal it has become more aggressive in the persian gulf harassing shipping and it has rejected several overtures from intermediaries offering talks with trump however the trump administration argues it is making gains by cutting down tehran s disposable cash we have denied the regime tens of billions of dollars in revenue they would otherwise spend on strengthening the regime and strengthening their proxies said brian hook the us iran envoy adding that consequently the iranian defence budget in  is  down on the previous year this is the necessary foreign policy to change the paradigm of iran s destabilizing efforts in the middle east there s no other way to accomplish this as cicero said money is the sinews of war and iran does not have the money that it used to it is unclear whether tactic of lowering the success threshold will carry trump through to the election in november next year as north korea fires off ever more provocative missiles tests and iran breaks free of its nuclear constraints trump s other option would be retake the initiative with bold action that could take military form though that would be the last resort a new conflict on the korean peninsula or the persian gulf would be disastrous electorally and otherwise the president was cocked and loaded to strike iran in june but called off the operation at the last moment when he was warned it could cost him his second term his instinct is to make an eye catching deal he has signaled his interest in another summit with kim jubilantly announcing the arrival of another very beautiful letter from the north korean dictator where he could offer a partial easing of sanctions for the destruction of some of north korea s nuclear weapons infrastructure trump s attempt to talk directly to iran s leadership have thus far been rebuffed but september s un general assembly offers another opportunity for a meeting with the iranian president hassan rouhani it would probably take a significant easing of economic pressure to pull that off trump may just think it is worth the risk even if entailed the departure of his ultra hawk national security adviser john bolton a partial trade deal might also be engineered with the chinese president xi jinping in which china restarts imports of us agricultural products in return perhaps for the easing of ban on dealing with the huawei tech giant i m guessing from what the president has said in the past he s willing to give more than other people in his team are willing to give but that s usually the case since he s transactional and he wants a deal said bonnie glaser the director of the china power project at the center for strategic and international studies so maybe there could be a prospect for some small deal that emerges in september trump will be trying to grab the headlines and portray himself as a leadertrump could seize any such agreement and proclaim it deal of the century the question would be whether pyongyang tehran or beijing is prepared to play along and that depends on whether they see an interest in helping the president win a second term it is remarkable how much agency these countries have rhodes said certainly iran china and north korea will be aware that anything they do will have an impact on the elections they have a vote kim has good reason to assist a president who has showered recognition and praise on its leader so could well consider concessions tehran would most certainly like to see him gone and will be unwilling to help stage diplomatic photo ops beijing too is showing signs it would rather not face a second trump term in the faces of such challenges from abroad trump has demonstrated a willingness to take brinksmanship ever closer to the edge of an all out trade war or a shooting war trump will be trying to grab the headlines and portray himself as a leader said julianne smith a former senior national security official in the obama

"Britain is to join the US in a naval mission to protect oil tankers in the Gulf from seizure by Iran, as London shifted away from plans for a European-led mission that had been proposed by the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt.The announcement by Boris Johnson’s government will involve the UK’s two Royal Navy ships in the Gulf collaborating with two US warships and Hunt’s successor urged other countries to join in.Dominic Raab, the new foreign secretary, said the UK had to respond to the “increased threat” now. He added: “Our aim is to build the broadest international support to uphold freedom of navigation in the region, as protected under international law.”France and Germany had indicated they would refuse to join any US-led mission, amid concerns about being too closely aligned to a Trump administration that has pulled out of the nuclear deal and contemplated airstrikes on the country.Despite that, UK was still hoping that by joining the US other countries would be persuaded to participate. Whitehall sources said “there had to come a point” where countries had to act to secure shipping in the Gulf.But on Monday those hopes were rebuffed again by Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, who repeated that his country would not join in a US-led operation: “At the moment the Britons would rather join an American mission. We won’t do that.”In an attempt to ally German and French concerns, Raab said that the UK “approach to Iran hasn’t changed”. The new government remained committed to de-escalation and to “maintain the nuclear deal”, the minister added.Meanwhile, Iran accused the US of engaging in “economic terrorism” against its people. The Iranian foreign secretary, Mohammad Javad Zarif, also warned Britain that acting in concert with the Trump administration would bring about a response from Tehran.During a briefing Zarif accused the US of seeking “to tie the ‘bread’ to ‘politics’” and added: “Britain is an accomplice in US economic terrorism, and this complicity will definitely bring about consequences for them.”Labour critics asked whether the shift in policy demonstrated by the naval announcement meant Johnson’s government was edging closer to the Trump administration’s Iran policy in terms of economic sanctions.Lord Wood of Anfield, a Labour peer, said: “The question is: will we thereby effectively be joining the US in their mission to stop all Iranian oil exports, a position which the US strongly adheres to, but the UK and EU oppose.”The announcement comes more than a fortnight after Iran seized the British-flagged Stena Impero oil tanker, prompting Hunt’s call for a “European-led” mission just days before his defeat in the leadership race by Boris Johnson and his eventual sacking.With little prospect of the European mission coming together, stretched British forces will soon start working with the US, which has a command and control operation in Bahrain, to accompany tankers passing through the strait of Hormuz.A fifth of the world’s oil passes through the waterway, bounded to the north by Iran, which has been accused of pursuing a policy of disrupting shipping in an attempt to lift the world oil price to retaliate against US sanctions.The Iranians seized the Stena Impero partly in response to the impounding of an Iran-flagged oil tanker, the Grace 1, in Gibraltar. Other ships in the Gulf had been sabotaged in recent weeks, damaged by mines above the waterline widely believed to have been planted by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards.The UK is patrolling the Gulf with two warships, HMS Duncan, a Type 45 Destroyer, which joined HMS Montrose, a Type 23 Frigate, at the end of last month. But when Stena Impero was seized in the strait, the Montrose was unable to intervene because it was 60 minutes’ sail away.A spokeswoman for the US Department of Defense said: “We welcome the decision of the UK to participate in the international maritime security construct to enhance maritime domain awareness, promote safe passage, and enhance freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf, strait of Hormuz, Arabian Sea, and Bab el-Mandeb.”",UK joins US in mission to protect oil tankers in Gulf,2019-08-05/19:45:54,britain is to join the us in a naval mission to protect oil tankers in the gulf from seizure by iran as london shifted away from plans for a european led mission that had been proposed by the former foreign secretary jeremy hunt the announcement by boris johnson s government will involve the uk s two royal navy ships in the gulf collaborating with two us warships and hunt s successor urged other countries to join in dominic raab the new foreign secretary said the uk had to respond to the increased threat now he added our aim is to build the broadest international support to uphold freedom of navigation in the region as protected under international law france and germany had indicated they would refuse to join any us led mission amid concerns about being too closely aligned to a trump administration that has pulled out of the nuclear deal and contemplated airstrikes on the country despite that uk was still hoping that by joining the us other countries would be persuaded to participate whitehall sources said there had to come a point where countries had to act to secure shipping in the gulf but on monday those hopes were rebuffed again by germany s foreign minister heiko maas who repeated that his country would not join in a us led operation at the moment the britons would rather join an american mission we won t do that in an attempt to ally german and french concerns raab said that the uk approach to iran hasn t changed the new government remained committed to de escalation and to maintain the nuclear deal the minister added meanwhile iran accused the us of engaging in economic terrorism against its people the iranian foreign secretary mohammad javad zarif also warned britain that acting in concert with the trump administration would bring about a response from tehran during a briefing zarif accused the us of seeking to tie the bread to politics and added britain is an accomplice in us economic terrorism and this complicity will definitely bring about consequences for them labour critics asked whether the shift in policy demonstrated by the naval announcement meant johnson s government was edging closer to the trump administration s iran policy in terms of economic sanctions lord wood of anfield a labour peer said the question is will we thereby effectively be joining the us in their mission to stop all iranian oil exports a position which the us strongly adheres to but the uk and eu oppose the announcement comes more than a fortnight after iran seized the british flagged stena impero oil tanker prompting hunt s call for a european led mission just days before his defeat in the leadership race by boris johnson and his eventual sacking with little prospect of the european mission coming together stretched british forces will soon start working with the us which has a command and control operation in bahrain to accompany tankers passing through the strait of hormuz a fifth of the world s oil passes through the waterway bounded to the north by iran which has been accused of pursuing a policy of disrupting shipping in an attempt to lift the world oil price to retaliate against us sanctions the iranians seized the stena impero partly in response to the impounding of an iran flagged oil tanker the grace  in gibraltar other ships in the gulf had been sabotaged in recent weeks damaged by mines above the waterline widely believed to have been planted by iran s revolutionary guards the uk is patrolling the gulf with two warships hms duncan a type  destroyer which joined hms montrose a type  frigate at the end of last month but when stena impero was seized in the strait the montrose was unable to intervene because it was  minutes sail away a spokeswoman for the us department of defense said we welcome the decision of the uk to participate in the international maritime security construct to enhance maritime domain awareness promote safe passage and enhance freedom of navigation in the arabian gulf strait of hormuz arabian sea and bab el mandeb ,Iran Sanctions,0.309071422
"Iran claims it has seized a third foreign oil tanker in the Gulf in a further escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington and its regional allies, who continue to stare each other down over crippling economic sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.Iranian state media claimed the tanker was Iraqi and was seized on Wednesday in a northern part of the strait of Hormuz with a cargo of 700,000 litres of oil bound for neighbouring Arab states. The strait is one of the world’s most important waterways, on which a combustible standoff has played out since early July, when a British warship intercepted an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar.Global shipping companies had not reported a tanker missing in the Gulf, in contrast to the furore that surrounded Iran’s seizure of the British-flagged ship Stena Impero last month, or the explosions that hulled four other tankers in the weeks before. Iranian-backed television in Lebanon broadcast footage of what it claimed was the latest seizure. Tehran and Baghdad maintain a close relationship and the implications of an Iraqi ship being seized by an ally were not immediately clear. The tanker shown in the footage was smaller than those caught up in earlier attacks. The claims could not be independently verified.It is understood the UK’s Department for Transport has tracked all of the British-flagged tankers in the region and all are accounted for. It is not thought there are any British nationals onboard or that the ship’s cargo is linked to Britain.Iranian officials claim the ship’s cargo was transferred to Iran’s Bushehr province, and onwards to the National Oil Distribution Company.Leaders of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have explicitly linked the seizure of the Stena Impero and its crew to the capture of the Iranian vessel, Grace 1, which Britain and the US claim was smuggling fuel to Syria. The seizure came amid a campaign of “maximum pressure” designed to diplomatically isolate Tehran and cripple its oil-dependent economy.The stated US aim of tightened economic sanctions, which were reimposed in May, is to force Iran to renegotiate the nuclear deal signed between both countries in 2015, but which Donald Trump withdrew from last year. That deal lifted a sanctions regime and allowed Iran to renew international oil trading in return for it agreeing not to enrich uranium – an essential component of a nuclear weapons programme, which its leaders had long been accused of secretly building.In the wake of Washington reneging on the deal, Iran has vowed to resume uranium enrichment and to continue trading oil, on which its increasingly vulnerable economy depends.The latest seizure comes days after the US imposed sanctions on Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif – the official who negotiated the nuclear deal with the Obama administration. The unusual move to sanction a global diplomat removes from the table the only senior Iranian official with whom senior US diplomats are familiar, and appears to place further obstacles in the way of a diplomatic solution to the crisis, which regional observers insist has the potential to spill over into a devastating war.Iranian officials have told regional counterparts that they believe the US president is prepared to act on his bellicose rhetoric to attack the country. The US has sent a small number of troops to neighbouring Saudi Arabia in the wake of the escalation in tensions, and Britain has pledged to escort all British tankers through the strait of Hormuz. US efforts to coerce European states to do the same have met a lukewarm reception, and Iran has warned against the use of naval escorts.Intelligence officials say a rise in proxy campaigns across the region, rather than a direct clash between Tehran and Washington, is a more likely outcome in the coming weeks. However, three officials who spoke with the Guardian cautioned that the potential for miscalculation remained high.The United Arab Emirates, which shares the strait with Iran, said on Friday that it and neighbouring Saudi Arabia, two regional foes, preferred a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. The UAE last week arranged a meeting between officials from the Iranian coastguard and its own forces.Additional reporting by Frances Perraudin",Iran claims it has seized third oil tanker in Gulf as tensions with US rise,2019-08-04/18:07:14,iran claims it has seized a third foreign oil tanker in the gulf in a further escalation of tensions between tehran and washington and its regional allies who continue to stare each other down over crippling economic sanctions imposed by the trump administration iranian state media claimed the tanker was iraqi and was seized on wednesday in a northern part of the strait of hormuz with a cargo of   litres of oil bound for neighbouring arab states the strait is one of the world s most important waterways on which a combustible standoff has played out since early july when a british warship intercepted an iranian tanker off the coast of gibraltar global shipping companies had not reported a tanker missing in the gulf in contrast to the furore that surrounded iran s seizure of the british flagged ship stena impero last month or the explosions that hulled four other tankers in the weeks before iranian backed television in lebanon broadcast footage of what it claimed was the latest seizure tehran and baghdad maintain a close relationship and the implications of an iraqi ship being seized by an ally were not immediately clear the tanker shown in the footage was smaller than those caught up in earlier attacks the claims could not be independently verified it is understood the uk s department for transport has tracked all of the british flagged tankers in the region and all are accounted for it is not thought there are any british nationals onboard or that the ship s cargo is linked to britain iranian officials claim the ship s cargo was transferred to iran s bushehr province and onwards to the national oil distribution company leaders of iran s revolutionary guards have explicitly linked the seizure of the stena impero and its crew to the capture of the iranian vessel grace  which britain and the us claim was smuggling fuel to syria the seizure came amid a campaign of maximum pressure designed to diplomatically isolate tehran and cripple its oil dependent economy the stated us aim of tightened economic sanctions which were reimposed in may is to force iran to renegotiate the nuclear deal signed between both countries in  but which donald trump withdrew from last year that deal lifted a sanctions regime and allowed iran to renew international oil trading in return for it agreeing not to enrich uranium an essential component of a nuclear weapons programme which its leaders had long been accused of secretly building in the wake of washington reneging on the deal iran has vowed to resume uranium enrichment and to continue trading oil on which its increasingly vulnerable economy depends the latest seizure comes days after the us imposed sanctions on iran s foreign minister javad zarif the official who negotiated the nuclear deal with the obama administration the unusual move to sanction a global diplomat removes from the table the only senior iranian official with whom senior us diplomats are familiar and appears to place further obstacles in the way of a diplomatic solution to the crisis which regional observers insist has the potential to spill over into a devastating war iranian officials have told regional counterparts that they believe the us president is prepared to act on his bellicose rhetoric to attack the country the us has sent a small number of troops to neighbouring saudi arabia in the wake of the escalation in tensions and britain has pledged to escort all british tankers through the strait of hormuz us efforts to coerce european states to do the same have met a lukewarm reception and iran has warned against the use of naval escorts intelligence officials say a rise in proxy campaigns across the region rather than a direct clash between tehran and washington is a more likely outcome in the coming weeks however three officials who spoke with the guardian cautioned that the potential for miscalculation remained high the united arab emirates which shares the strait with iran said on friday that it and neighbouring saudi arabia two regional foes preferred a diplomatic resolution to the crisis the uae last week arranged a meeting between officials from the iranian coastguard and its own forces additional reporting by frances perraudin,Iran Sanctions,0.329322368
"The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, striking at the main diplomatic channel between Iran and the west.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said Zarif had been targeted because he acted on behalf of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.“Foreign Minister Zarif is a key enabler of Ayatollah Khamenei’s policies throughout the region and around the world,” Pompeo said in a written statement. “The designation of Javad Zarif today reflects this reality.”In a later tweet, Pompeo added: “He’s just as complicit in the regime’s outlaw behaviour as the rest of [Khamenei’s] mafia.”Zarif responded quickly on Twitter, shrugging off the significance of the US move.“The US’ reason for designating me is that I am Iran’s ‘primary spokesperson around the world’ Is the truth really that painful?” he asked. “It has no effect on me or my family, as I have no property or interests outside of Iran. Thank you for considering me such a huge threat to your agenda.”Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said the move was “childish” and a barrier to diplomacy.Shortly after Washington announced the sanctions on Zarif, the White House’s national security advisor, John Bolton, said the US would renew sanctions waivers for Iranian nuclear programs that allow Russia, China and European countries to continue their civilian nuclear cooperation with Tehran.“I think the idea here is we are watching those nuclear activities very, very closely,” Bolton said in an interview on Fox Business Network. “So this is a short 90-day extension,” he said.A report in the Washington Post last week said the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, had argued for renewing the waivers over the objections of Pompeo and Bolton because if they were not renewed, Washington would have to sanction Russian, Chinese and European firms involved in projects inside Iran as part of the 2015 nuclear deal.The administration had first threatened to sanction Zarif last month, but relented to allow him to visit New York, while strictly limiting his freedom of movement within the city. During his stay in New York, the Iranian foreign minister is reported to have met Senator Rand Paul, who Donald Trump had said was seeking to help negotiations between the two countries.Zarif was the chief Iranian negotiator in the 2015 deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which the US withdrew in May last year. In the face of mounting US efforts to kill the agreement, the Iranian diplomat continued to meet his counterparts from Europe, Russia and China, who have been anxious to keep the deal afloat.Tensions between the US and Iran escalated in May when Washington tightened sanctions, in effect barring all countries from buying Iranian oil.Last month Iran seized of the British-linked oil tanker MT Riah in the strait of Hormuz, apparently in retaliation for the UK seizing the Iranian tanker Grace 1 off Gibraltar. Zarif accused London of “ doing the bidding for the Trump administration.”“The Zarif designation is one of the most ridiculous steps I’ve seen this administration take. It won’t meaningfully affect Zarif’s diplomacy, it probably won’t result in much in terms of asset freeze or complications for him, and will annoy other world leaders,” said Richard Nephew, former principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the state department.","US imposes sanctions on Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif",2019-07-31/23:54:08,the trump administration has imposed sanctions on iran s foreign minister mohammad javad zarif striking at the main diplomatic channel between iran and the west the us secretary of state mike pompeo said zarif had been targeted because he acted on behalf of the supreme leader ali khamenei foreign minister zarif is a key enabler of ayatollah khamenei s policies throughout the region and around the world pompeo said in a written statement the designation of javad zarif today reflects this reality in a later tweet pompeo added he s just as complicit in the regime s outlaw behaviour as the rest of khamenei s mafia zarif responded quickly on twitter shrugging off the significance of the us move the us reason for designating me is that i am iran s primary spokesperson around the world is the truth really that painful he asked it has no effect on me or my family as i have no property or interests outside of iran thank you for considering me such a huge threat to your agenda iran s president hassan rouhani said the move was childish and a barrier to diplomacy shortly after washington announced the sanctions on zarif the white house s national security advisor john bolton said the us would renew sanctions waivers for iranian nuclear programs that allow russia china and european countries to continue their civilian nuclear cooperation with tehran i think the idea here is we are watching those nuclear activities very very closely bolton said in an interview on fox business network so this is a short  day extension he said a report in the washington post last week said the treasury secretary steven mnuchin had argued for renewing the waivers over the objections of pompeo and bolton because if they were not renewed washington would have to sanction russian chinese and european firms involved in projects inside iran as part of the  nuclear deal the administration had first threatened to sanction zarif last month but relented to allow him to visit new york while strictly limiting his freedom of movement within the city during his stay in new york the iranian foreign minister is reported to have met senator rand paul who donald trump had said was seeking to help negotiations between the two countries zarif was the chief iranian negotiator in the  deal the joint comprehensive plan of action from which the us withdrew in may last year in the face of mounting us efforts to kill the agreement the iranian diplomat continued to meet his counterparts from europe russia and china who have been anxious to keep the deal afloat tensions between the us and iran escalated in may when washington tightened sanctions in effect barring all countries from buying iranian oil last month iran seized of the british linked oil tanker mt riah in the strait of hormuz apparently in retaliation for the uk seizing the iranian tanker grace  off gibraltar zarif accused london of doing the bidding for the trump administration the zarif designation is one of the most ridiculous steps i ve seen this administration take it won t meaningfully affect zarif s diplomacy it probably won t result in much in terms of asset freeze or complications for him and will annoy other world leaders said richard nephew former principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the state department ,Iran Sanctions,0.346296698
"The UK has invited military representatives of the US, France and other European countries to a meeting in Bahrain on Wednesday in an attempt to create an international mission to safeguard shipping through the strait of Hormuz.Britain hopes it can act as bridge between the US – which has the largest military presence of a western nation in the region – and countries such as Germany, which is reluctant to getting involved in any mission led by Washington.Whitehall sources said the British proposal to create a European-led mission to prevent future tanker seizures by Iran was still alive despite the dismissal of Jeremy Hunt as as foreign secretary in Boris Johnson’s cabinet reshuffle.But they conceded its success would be dependent on the involvement of the US, “whether at the head of or in support of the mission”. The US’s Fifth Fleet, responsible for the Gulf, is based in Bahrain.Two weeks ago Iran seized a British-flagged oil tanker, the Stena Impero. Tehran said the tanker had cut off its communications system. The UK said it was seized illegally in Omani waters.The seizure demonstrated the difficulties that Britain has in protecting its shipping in the strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes through.Although a Royal Navy vessel – the HMS Montrose – was in the region trying to protect British shipping, it was an hour’s sail away when the seizure occurred. A second British ship, the HMS Duncan, has been sent to the Gulf, but the ships are trying to cover a range of 19,000 nautical miles.The Iranian seizure came after the UK seized an Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar that Britain said was bound for Syria in defiance of EU sanctions.British officials argue that other European countries should get involved in an international naval mission that has latterly been an Anglo-Iranian dispute because “they have skin in the game” given the importance of the continuity of oil supplies. The meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday afternoon and is not expected to lead to an immediate outcome, British officials have indicated. They said proposals would be taken back to national governments for further discussion.Separately, the US embassy in Berlin confirmed it had formally asked Germany, as well as Britain and France, to join it in a naval mission in the Gulf, which could form part of the UK-led efforts.Diplomatic sources said the statement was an attempt to put pressure on Germany to become involved. “We’ve formally asked Germany to join France and the UK to help secure the strait of Hormuz and combat Iranian aggression,” said a US embassy spokesperson in Berlin.The embassy added: “Members of the German government have been clear that freedom of navigation should be protected … Our question is: protected by whom?”There is considerable opposition among Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partners in Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition, to getting involved in a US-led mission.“The German government has already rejected participation in the US military mission, Operation Sentinel, to protect shipping in the strait of Hormuz,” said Nils Schmid, a foreign affairs spokesman for the SPD parliamentary party, in an interview with Stuttgarter Zeitung. “It should stay like that. Otherwise, there is a risk of being pulled into a war against Iran on the side of the United States.”",UK calls meeting with US and France to discuss Hormuz plan,2019-07-30/19:38:24,the uk has invited military representatives of the us france and other european countries to a meeting in bahrain on wednesday in an attempt to create an international mission to safeguard shipping through the strait of hormuz britain hopes it can act as bridge between the us which has the largest military presence of a western nation in the region and countries such as germany which is reluctant to getting involved in any mission led by washington whitehall sources said the british proposal to create a european led mission to prevent future tanker seizures by iran was still alive despite the dismissal of jeremy hunt as as foreign secretary in boris johnson s cabinet reshuffle but they conceded its success would be dependent on the involvement of the us whether at the head of or in support of the mission the us s fifth fleet responsible for the gulf is based in bahrain two weeks ago iran seized a british flagged oil tanker the stena impero tehran said the tanker had cut off its communications system the uk said it was seized illegally in omani waters the seizure demonstrated the difficulties that britain has in protecting its shipping in the strait of hormuz through which about a fifth of the world s oil passes through although a royal navy vessel the hms montrose was in the region trying to protect british shipping it was an hour s sail away when the seizure occurred a second british ship the hms duncan has been sent to the gulf but the ships are trying to cover a range of   nautical miles the iranian seizure came after the uk seized an iranian oil tanker in gibraltar that britain said was bound for syria in defiance of eu sanctions british officials argue that other european countries should get involved in an international naval mission that has latterly been an anglo iranian dispute because they have skin in the game given the importance of the continuity of oil supplies the meeting is scheduled to take place on wednesday afternoon and is not expected to lead to an immediate outcome british officials have indicated they said proposals would be taken back to national governments for further discussion separately the us embassy in berlin confirmed it had formally asked germany as well as britain and france to join it in a naval mission in the gulf which could form part of the uk led efforts diplomatic sources said the statement was an attempt to put pressure on germany to become involved we ve formally asked germany to join france and the uk to help secure the strait of hormuz and combat iranian aggression said a us embassy spokesperson in berlin the embassy added members of the german government have been clear that freedom of navigation should be protected our question is protected by whom there is considerable opposition among germany s social democrats spd the junior partners in angela merkel s ruling coalition to getting involved in a us led mission the german government has already rejected participation in the us military mission operation sentinel to protect shipping in the strait of hormuz said nils schmid a foreign affairs spokesman for the spd parliamentary party in an interview with stuttgarter zeitung it should stay like that otherwise there is a risk of being pulled into a war against iran on the side of the united states ,Iran Sanctions,0.250351727
"Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have released an audio recording in which one of their officers appears to tell a British warship to back off as a naval patrol seized a UK-flagged oil tanker in the strait of Hormuz on 19 July.The clip is of a radio exchange in which a guards patrol boat officer tells HMS Montrose to back off while the Iranians seized the Stena Impero vessel passing through the strategic waterway.The audio clip begins with an officer directly addressing the Montrose using a call sign: “British warship Foxtrot 236, this is Sepah navy patrol boat: you are required not to interfere in this issue.”A British-accented voice responds: “This is British warship Foxtrot 236: I am in vicinity of an internationally recognised strait with a merchant vessel in my vicinity conducting transit passage.”The Iranian officer tells the Montrose that the situation could escalate if it tries to intervene: “British warship Foxtrot 236, this is Sepah navy patrol boat: don’t put your life in danger.”At the time, the frigate was too far away to defend the tanker – 60 minutes away, according to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). The royal navy ship had been covering an operating area of 19,000 nautical miles.The release of the recording is an attempt to demonstrate Iran’s naval capabilities in the region a day after HMS Duncan, a navy destroyer, arrived in the Gulf to support the Montrose in defence of tankers passing through the strait.Iran seized the Stena Impero after the UK seized the Iranian-owned Grace 1 off Gibraltar earlier this month. The UK said it had acted to halt a vessel believed to be carrying oil to Syria in defiance of EU sanctions.Last week Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, indicated that his country might be willing to contemplate a tanker swap – but the idea was ruled out by Britain’s new foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in an interview on Monday morning.Raab said the two seizures were not equivalent. “Grace 1 was intercepted because it was in breach of sanctions and heading with oil for Syria and that was the intelligence,” he said.“We were absolutely lawful entitled to detain it in the way we did. The Stena Impero was unlawfully detained. This is not about some kind of barter.

"A second UK warship has arrived in the Gulf to protect British commercial ships amid heightened tensions in the region, the Ministry of Defence has said.The type 45 destroyer HMS Duncan will work alongside the frigate HMS Montrose to accompany British vessels through the strait of Hormuz.HMS Montrose covers an operating area of about 19,000 nautical miles and has so far accompanied 35 merchant vessels through the strait, according to the MoD.The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said that freedom of navigation in the strait of Hormuz was “vital not just to the UK, but also our international partners and allies.“While we continue to push for a diplomatic resolution that will make this possible again without military accompaniment, the Royal Navy will continue to provide a safeguard for UK vessels until this is the reality.”Commander Tom Trent, the commanding officer of HMS Duncan, said: “We have relocated from an intense deployment in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, which included support to the French carrier strike group with live operations in Syria.”Last week, the government confirmed that the Royal Navy had been tasked with accompanying British-flagged ships through the strait to provide reassurance to the shipping industry.It followed two sets of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman and an attempt by the Iranian navy to push a British oil ship towards Iranian waters.Britain’s relations with Iran worsened when the UK seized an Iranian ship, Grace 1, near Gibraltar earlier this month. The ship was suspected of breaching EU sanctions by carrying oil destined for Syria. Tehran denied the ship was heading for Syria and threatened to seize a British oil tanker in retaliation if it was not released.A British-flagged oil tanker, Stena Impero, was seized by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard in the shipping route last week. A second British-linked tanker was also boarded by armed guards before being released.On Wednesday, the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani indicated that the captured Stena Impero could be released if the UK returns Grace 1 to Iran.On Sunday, he wrote to Boris Johnson saying that he hoped diplomatic ties between the two countries would be stronger under the leadership of the new prime minister.In the letter, published on his website, he congratulated Johnson, and said he hoped his “only one visit to Tehran” when foreign secretary in 2017 and now his tenure as PM would lead to a “further deepening of bilateral and multilateral relations”.",Second UK warship arrives to guard ships in strait of Hormuz,2019-07-28/19:50:24,a second uk warship has arrived in the gulf to protect british commercial ships amid heightened tensions in the region the ministry of defence has said the type  destroyer hms duncan will work alongside the frigate hms montrose to accompany british vessels through the strait of hormuz hms montrose covers an operating area of about   nautical miles and has so far accompanied  merchant vessels through the strait according to the mod the defence secretary ben wallace said that freedom of navigation in the strait of hormuz was vital not just to the uk but also our international partners and allies while we continue to push for a diplomatic resolution that will make this possible again without military accompaniment the royal navy will continue to provide a safeguard for uk vessels until this is the reality commander tom trent the commanding officer of hms duncan said we have relocated from an intense deployment in the mediterranean and black sea which included support to the french carrier strike group with live operations in syria last week the government confirmed that the royal navy had been tasked with accompanying british flagged ships through the strait to provide reassurance to the shipping industry it followed two sets of attacks on oil tankers in the gulf of oman and an attempt by the iranian navy to push a british oil ship towards iranian waters britain s relations with iran worsened when the uk seized an iranian ship grace  near gibraltar earlier this month the ship was suspected of breaching eu sanctions by carrying oil destined for syria tehran denied the ship was heading for syria and threatened to seize a british oil tanker in retaliation if it was not released a british flagged oil tanker stena impero was seized by iran s revolutionary guard in the shipping route last week a second british linked tanker was also boarded by armed guards before being released on wednesday the iranian president hassan rouhani indicated that the captured stena impero could be released if the uk returns grace  to iran on sunday he wrote to boris johnson saying that he hoped diplomatic ties between the two countries would be stronger under the leadership of the new prime minister in the letter published on his website he congratulated johnson and said he hoped his only one visit to tehran when foreign secretary in  and now his tenure as pm would lead to a further deepening of bilateral and multilateral relations ,Iran Sanctions,0.296309412
"The path to improved British-Iranian relations has hit a new barrier after the high court in London ruled that the UK does not have to pay at least £20m interest on the £387m it owes to Iran over the cancelled sale of Chieftain tanks in the 1970s.The debt was seen by Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary as critical to the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Iranian-British dual national imprisoned in Tehran.A ruling by Mr Justice Phillips this week said the UK did not owe interest accumulated over 10 years on the sum it acknowledges it owes to Iran. The issue of whether there is an Iranian body to which the UK can lawfully pay the £387m remains to be determined. In February 2018 after meeting Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, Johnson’s team briefed to the Sun that the owed money would be handed over to Iran, but disagreements in Whitehall meant it did not happen.Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, is understood to have been so furious about the non-payment of the money and what he regarded as Foreign Office double dealing that it is claimed he washed his hands of the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case.Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s supporters say the briefing to the Sun was more damaging to her chances of release than Johnson’s better-known mistake when he said she had been training journalists at the time of her arrest in Tehran. Her family say she was there on holiday.Supporters including her MP, Tulip Siddiq, have raised questions about the scale of the legal fees the UK is racking up in the debt dispute.The Ministry of Defence has supplied answers to Siddiq suggesting that the legal costs over 40 years were between £32m and £41m. Ministers argue that sanctions against Iran have to be respected whatever the diplomatic gains from handing over the money.The latest court case was about whether the MoD should pay interest on the debt accumulated in the period after the Iranian body to which the money is owed became subject to EU sanctions. The Sunday Times successfully applied for a secrecy order on the case to be lifted.The initial dispute centred on a 1970s defence deal between the Iranian defence ministry and International Military Services (IMS), a venture wholly owned by the MoD. IMS agreed a deal in 1971 to sell the shah of Iran more than 1,500 Chieftain tanks and armoured vehicles. The contracts were cancelled in February 1979 after the shah was deposed in a revolution. Iran had already paid for the undelivered tanks and demanded its money back.",Court ruling over tanks debt deals new blow to UK-Iran relations,2019-07-26/05:00:04,the path to improved british iranian relations has hit a new barrier after the high court in london ruled that the uk does not have to pay at least m interest on the m it owes to iran over the cancelled sale of chieftain tanks in the s the debt was seen by boris johnson when he was foreign secretary as critical to the release of nazanin zaghari ratcliffe the iranian british dual national imprisoned in tehran a ruling by mr justice phillips this week said the uk did not owe interest accumulated over  years on the sum it acknowledges it owes to iran the issue of whether there is an iranian body to which the uk can lawfully pay the m remains to be determined in february  after meeting zaghari ratcliffe s husband richard ratcliffe johnson s team briefed to the sun that the owed money would be handed over to iran but disagreements in whitehall meant it did not happen iran s foreign minister javad zarif is understood to have been so furious about the non payment of the money and what he regarded as foreign office double dealing that it is claimed he washed his hands of the zaghari ratcliffe case zaghari ratcliffe s supporters say the briefing to the sun was more damaging to her chances of release than johnson s better known mistake when he said she had been training journalists at the time of her arrest in tehran her family say she was there on holiday supporters including her mp tulip siddiq have raised questions about the scale of the legal fees the uk is racking up in the debt dispute the ministry of defence has supplied answers to siddiq suggesting that the legal costs over  years were between m and m ministers argue that sanctions against iran have to be respected whatever the diplomatic gains from handing over the money the latest court case was about whether the mod should pay interest on the debt accumulated in the period after the iranian body to which the money is owed became subject to eu sanctions the sunday times successfully applied for a secrecy order on the case to be lifted the initial dispute centred on a s defence deal between the iranian defence ministry and international military services ims a venture wholly owned by the mod ims agreed a deal in  to sell the shah of iran more than   chieftain tanks and armoured vehicles the contracts were cancelled in february  after the shah was deposed in a revolution iran had already paid for the undelivered tanks and demanded its money back ,Iran Sanctions,0.226337418
"Iran has indicated it wants to de-escalate the British-Iranian crisis, hinting at swapping two captured tankers.“We do not seek the continuation of tension with some European countries,” Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said on Wednesday during a weekly cabinet meeting. “If Britain steps away from the wrong actions in Gibraltar, they will receive an appropriate response from Iran.”He was speaking after a two-day visit by Iraq’s prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, who had revealed he went to Tehran this week partly at the request of the UK defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, to negotiate the release of the captured British-flagged ship Stena Impero seized by Iranian forces in the strait of Hormuz last Friday.The Iraqi prime minister revealed that on Monday “there was a phone call with the British defence minister to discuss bilateral ties, the regional crisis, and efforts of de-escalation and decreasing tensions in the region, and also the existing crisis covering the confiscated ships”. Iraq is a strong opponent of US sanctions against Iran.Iran said it had seized the Stena Impero after the UK seized an Iranian ship, Grace 1, off Gibraltar. The Foreign Office has claimed continuing negotiations with Iranian officials in London about the terms of the ship’s release were interrupted by the surprise Iranian decision to capture the Stena Impero. Britain has offered to release Grace 1 as long as Iran provides guarantees that the ship will not continue with a plan to unload Iran’s oil at the Syrian port of Baniyas refinery. The UK has said any export sales to the refinery are prohibited under EU law.Iran said the oil was not destined for Syria but will not name its actual destination, saying that would expose the customer to US sanctions.The new US defence secretary, Mark Esper, said on Wednesday, than Washington was also seeking to defuse the standoff in the Gulf.“We’re trying to deescalate and at the same time message them very clearly that without preconditions, any time, any place, we are willing to meet with them and talk about how we get back into a negotiation,” Esper told reporters.He added that European plans to coordinate naval escorts for oil tankers transiting the strait of Hormuz were “complementary” to the US proposal, dubbed Operational Sentinel. “The Brits are escorting their ships, and we will escort our ships to the degree the risk demands it and I assume other countries will escort their ships.”Esper said US escort for tankers could be done party from the air. “In some cases that may be strictly an overhead capability. It may mean there is a US naval warship within proximity to deter it […] I don’t necessarily mean that’s every US flagged ship going through the strait has a destroyer right behind it.”A study suggested the seizure was legal under Gibraltarian law, but only as a result of regulations passed on 3 July – the day before the seizure – which gave the first minister the power to designate a ship for seizure if it is in breach of EU regulations on sanctions against Syria.The study by Michelle Linderman, a partner at Crowell & Moring’s international trade group, said the sanctions applied only if the ship was in Gibraltarian waters at the time of the seizure.Rouhani’s possible olive branch on a ship swap came as part of a broader set of remarks containing Iran’s familiar mixture of threats and assertions of its willingness to negotiate.But in a sign that the crisis could potentially escalate quickly given the many layers of Iranian politics, Iranian officials quoted by Al Jazeera claimed the United Arab Emirates was being turned into operations headquarters for the US after an attempt at regional mediation failed.Hossein Dehqan, an adviser to the Iranian supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, claimed all US military bases and pieces in the region would be directly targeted if Washington took the decision to go to war, stressing that any American war against his country meant that the US would face Iran and its allies throughout the region.He said any change in the situation of the strait of Hormuz would increase tension and could open the door to a dangerous confrontation.In his cabinet remarks, Rouhani vowed to take a third step away from the Iran nuclear deal unless progress was made in its demands for greater European efforts to lift the economic pressure placed on Tehran by the US. “We will surely take the third step,” he said. Iran has already breached permitted uranium enrichment levels and stocks in minor but clear violations of the agreement signed in 2015, but from which the US has unilaterally withdrawn.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondent“Europe must expedite its attempts to meet Iran’s legitimate [economic] interests [under the deal] and bring about truce in the US economic warfare,” Rouhani said.He also warned against any British-led attempt to form an international coalition to protect shipping in the Gulf, saying the Iranian Revolutionary Guards were responsible for security in the strait of Hormuz.The response comes after Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and France on Tuesday backed the UK’s proposal for a European naval force to protect shipping in the Gulf, which would be distinct from any US maritime security operation.Germany said it was still studying the plans. “We are taking part intensively in these talks, but the conceptional deliberations are just beginning. It is too early today to talk about the form of possible German support or participation,” a government spokesman said.In practice, the proposals will probably await a policy decision from the new prime minister and his foreign secretary.The announcement of Boris Johnson’s premiership was greeted with concern by both reformist and conservative newspapers in Tehran, many of them calling him the “British Trump”, as the banner headline of the reformist Sazandegi read over a full-page picture of Johnson celebrating his win.The conservative newspaper Jaam-e Jam noted Johnson had spoken of regime change in Iran, but added he had said he would not join a US-led war against Iran.The reformist Etemaad’s headline read “Elected by hardliners”, warning Johnson wanted to get close to the US president. But the newspaper added: “Every day you can expect a fascinating event in the UK. Britain’s policy is a surprise to anyone following it every day.”The conservative Resalat published a cartoon of Johnson in the manner of a British butler, being patted on the head by Trump at his desk in the Oval Office, claiming the hardliners were coming to power throughout Europe.",Iran hints at ship swap with UK amid de-escalation efforts,2019-07-24/15:24:23,iran has indicated it wants to

"Boris Johnson is taking the helm with an urgent crisis brewing in the Gulf, where Iran’s seizure of a British oil tanker threatens to pull the UK and the international community into the escalating friction between Washington and Tehran. But in crisis there is opportunity, and the new prime minister should use his affinity with Donald Trump to de-escalate responsibly while reinforcing the battered transatlantic relationship around Iran.Tehran has accused the tanker, the Stena Impero, of colliding with a fishing boat and violating international regulations. However, the seizure came shortly after Iranian leaders threatened to retaliate for the British seizure of an Iranian-flagged vessel in Gibraltar over suspicions that the ship had violated European Union sanctions on Syria.The standoff has erupted in a climate of broader tensions in the Gulf since the Trump administration began ratcheting up economic pressure on Tehran. After the latest intensification of US sanctions in May, Iran-linked proxies have launched attacks on at least four tankers as well as a Saudi pipeline and various American facilities in Iraq. Last month, the two countries narrowly avoided a direct military confrontation; after an Iranian surface-to-air missile downed an American drone, Trump gave initial approval for strikes on Iran before reversing the order and authorising cyberattacks and additional sanctions.Tehran’s provocations are unfortunate but hardly unanticipated. Its seizure of the Stena Impero is consistent with Iran’s longstanding strategic doctrine that advocates a forceful response to pressure as the most effective means of deterring even greater pressure. In this case, the counter-response is part of a broader gambit aimed at extricating Iran from the prospect of an unremitting state of economic siege imposed by Washington.The Trump administration’s May 2018 decision to exit the 2015 nuclear deal has proven catastrophically effective, at least in terms of its impact on Iran’s economy. Reimposed US economic sanctions have slashed Iran’s oil exports, severed its banking relationships with the world and generated high inflation and shortages for ordinary Iranians.Tehran has long experience of economic challenges, beginning with the 1979 revolution and the brutal eight-year war with Iraq that followed. And Iranian leaders have considerable expertise in mitigating US sanctions. But an indefinite American stranglehold represents an existential threat for a regime whose ageing leaders are trying to maintain control over a dynamic, well-educated society hungry for opportunity and engagement with the world.Iranian leaders initially sought economic relief from Europe, to little avail. European governments are deeply committed to sustaining the nuclear deal, but they proved powerless to forestall European firms from rushing to exit Iran for fear of US penalties. Although Europe has finally launched a banking channel to preserve some humanitarian trade with Iran, it’s clear that Europe can’t appreciably offset the costs of the US withdrawal from the deal.Faced with a bad hand, Tehran is using the tools at its disposal, its prodigious destabilising capabilities, to change the status quo in its own favour. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has argued that Washington seeks to weaken Iran through pressure, and after the country has been debilitated, to use negotiations as a mechanism for stealing Iranian rights and capabilities. He insisted that Iran has to deploy its own pressure tactics to outmanoeuvre this trap.From this viewpoint, Iran’s escalations make dangerous sense. Provocations in the Gulf inject urgency among the other stakeholders to the nuclear deal. The threat to shipping raises the costs associated with a continued crisis, both in financial terms, via skyrocketing insurance premiums for tanker traffic, and geopolitics, by raising fears of a larger and more ruinous military confrontation. For Tehran, war jitters may galvanise more serious international efforts to restrain Trump’s hawkish policies. And the risks may also influence Washington’s calculus, particularly for a president in the throes of a re-election campaign who watches petrol prices closely and has long inveighed against another US military intervention in the Middle East.The attacks helpfully intimidate some of Iran’s neighbours, by threatening to disperse the pain and consequences of Trump’s policy on to those governments that have been its most ardent cheerleaders. Even better, the seizure of the Stena Impero can be justified as a commensurate response to the impounding of the Grace 1 – a strong counter-response to perceived British bullying has considerable appeal for an Iranian public beleaguered by economic suffering.Together with its recent efforts to inch away from the nuclear deal’s restrictions, increasing frictions in the Gulf unfortunately have strengthened Iran’s position. Tehran will take care to avoid inadvertent escalation or a wholesale breach with Europe, but so far Iranian leaders are gaining more traction with provocation than the “strategic patience” they displayed during the first year after Trump exited the deal.Britain and the US also need to strike a careful balance in responding to this latest incident. Trump’s hesitancy to use force after June’s drone strike has emboldened Tehran, so it’s imperative that Iranian leaders appreciate the costs of continued harassment of civilian shipping in the Gulf will vastly outweigh any leverage Iran hopes to accumulate. Johnson is well situated to work with Washington to reinforce this message and rebuild a common approach to Gulf security.At the same time, Johnson should seek to revive serious diplomacy with Iran. Expectations must be modest; there is no realistic prospect of a new comprehensive agreement that addresses all of Washington’s demands. But a fresh negotiating process can provide openings for resolving specific issues, such as Iran’s unjust detention of foreign nationals including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, as well as opportunities for reducing conflict in the Gulf and confidence-building around the region. The alternative – incessant threats to the world’s most important energy corridor and the perpetuation of the US vice-like grip on Iran’s economy – would be ruinous for all sides.• Suzanne Maloney is

ayatollah ali khamenei has argued that washington seeks to weaken iran through pressure and after the country has been debilitated to use negotiations as a mechanism for stealing iranian rights and capabilities he insisted that iran has to deploy its own pressure tactics to outmanoeuvre this trap from this viewpoint iran s escalations make dangerous sense provocations in the gulf inject urgency among the other stakeholders to the nuclear deal the threat to shipping raises the costs associated with a continued crisis both in financial terms via skyrocketing insurance premiums for tanker traffic and geopolitics by raising fears of a larger and more ruinous military confrontation for tehran war jitters may galvanise more serious international efforts to restrain trump s hawkish policies and the risks may also influence washington s calculus particularly for a president in the throes of a re election campaign who watches petrol prices closely and has long inveighed against another us military intervention in the middle east the attacks helpfully intimidate some of iran s neighbours by threatening to disperse the pain and consequences of trump s policy on to those governments that have been its most ardent cheerleaders even better the seizure of the stena impero can be justified as a commensurate response to the impounding of the grace  a strong counter response to perceived british bullying has considerable appeal for an iranian public beleaguered by economic suffering together with its recent efforts to inch away from the nuclear deal s restrictions increasing frictions in the gulf unfortunately have strengthened iran s position tehran will take care to avoid inadvertent escalation or a wholesale breach with europe but so far iranian leaders are gaining more traction with provocation than the strategic patience they displayed during the first year after trump exited the deal britain and the us also need to strike a careful balance in responding to this latest incident trump s hesitancy to use force after june s drone strike has emboldened tehran so it s imperative that iranian leaders appreciate the costs of continued harassment of civilian shipping in the gulf will vastly outweigh any leverage iran hopes to accumulate johnson is well situated to work with washington to reinforce this message and rebuild a common approach to gulf security at the same time johnson should seek to revive serious diplomacy with iran expectations must be modest there is no realistic prospect of a new comprehensive agreement that addresses all of washington s demands but a fresh negotiating process can provide openings for resolving specific issues such as iran s unjust detention of foreign nationals including nazanin zaghari ratcliffe as well as opportunities for reducing conflict in the gulf and confidence building around the region the alternative incessant threats to the world s most important energy corridor and the perpetuation of the us vice like grip on iran s economy would be ruinous for all sides suzanne maloney is deputy director of foreign policy at the brookings institution,Iran Sanctions,0.284625918
"Plans for a European-led maritime security force in the Gulf unveiled by the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, hit choppy waters as the plan was rejected by Iran and met resistance from supporters of the incoming prime minister, Boris Johnson.It has also been seen by British shipping industry experts as not providing a short-term solution to the crisis facing UK-flagged shipping in the Gulf.On Monday, Hunt unveiled a plan for a European-led maritime security force, making clear he regarded a proposed rival plan for a US force as likely to be seen by the Iranians as an escalatory step, partly since Washington opposes the Iran nuclear deal.America’s rejection of the Iran deal in May 2018 has set off a chain of slow-motion events culminating in the seizure last Friday of the British flagged ship Stena Impero. Hunt condemned the Iranian seizure as an act of state piracy.The Iranian vice-president, Eshaq Jahangiri, said any international coalition to protect the Gulf would bring only insecurity. “There is no need to form a coalition because these kinds of coalitions and the presence of foreigners in the region by itself creates insecurity,” he said. “And other than increasing insecurity it will not achieve anything else.”Iran has dispatched one of its most senior diplomats, Abbas Araghchi, to Paris for talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in a bid to find a way out of the impasse. He is said to be carrying a written message from Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president.Iran said it would attend a Sunday meeting in Vienna of diplomats from countries still supporting the 2015 nuclear deal as they try to salvage the agreement.European leaders have broadly welcomed the Hunt plan even if it is seen as ironic that the UK is proposing a European security initiative at the point it plans to the leave the EU.The UK envisages a multinational maritime operation that could also include countries in the Gulf region. A multinational operation is perceived as faster to set up than an EU mission, as the UK government faces pressure from industry to protect the half a trillion dollars that passes through the strait of Hormuz each year.A UK diplomat said: “We are engaging our partners around the world, including within the EU. EU partners have expressed interest in our proposal.”Johnson’s allies appear to be willing to continue Britain’s support for the Iran nuclear deal, but see no need for America to be excluded from plans for a maritime security patrols through the Gulf. There is also resentment at the fact Hunt is attempting such far-reaching steps with implications for the future of the “special relationship” when he may be living on borrowed time as foreign secretary.The Foreign Office said any distinct European-led maritime initiative would not exclude America, but work in cooperation with the US naval forces.Hunt told MPs on Monday that the UK “will be seeking to coordinate any European efforts on freedom of navigation with anything that the US does. But we want our contribution, the UK’s contribution, to be to make that coalition as broad as possible”.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service. Saudi Arabia subsequently blames Iran for the attack.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It's not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: 'If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!'Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom's south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US 'spy' drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker, Grace 1, the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row. Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.Hunt’s allies believe he could not leave a vacuum at a time of crisis and there is no constitutional requirement for the cabinet to consult a then-candidate for the Conservative leadership over British security plans. Hunt’s future as foreign secretary remains in question and the scale of his leadership election defeat will be weighed against the disruption of changing foreign secretary at a time of crisis.British shipping representatives fear the plan for a European-led convoy might take as long as four months to be operational and many British ships, fearing capture by Iran, might de-flag in the interim unless they feel fully protected. They are seeking talks with the Department for Transport over interim protection.British shipping executives reported the cost of war insurance for shipping going through the strait of Hormuz was soaring. They said the costs for a voyage through the strait for a very large crude carrier (VLCC), the most common supertanker in the range of 200,000 to 400,000 tonnes, was set to rise by about $500,000 (£402,000). There are fears that shipping companies will start unflagging from the British ensign fearing the flag turns the ship into an Iranian target. Some Iranian MPs have also called for tolls on British and US ships moving through the strait.The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, insisted Johnson needed to understand Iran was not seeking confrontation. Speaking after meeting his Nicaraguan counterpart, Denis Moncada, on Monday, he told reporters “It’s important for everybody to realise, it’s important for Boris Johnson to understand, that Iran does not seek confrontation. Iran wants to have normal relations based on mutual respect.”Zarif made no reference to the UK-proposed EU-led maritime protection force but said: “We have 1,500 miles of coastline in the Persian Gulf. We are responsible for the security and the freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf. That is our lifeline.”Using his usual description of the group around the hawkish US national security adviser John Bolton as the B-team, he said: “It is much much better for the United Kingdom not to be engaged in implementing the ploys of the B-team. The B-team is losing ground in the United States and now they are turning their attention to the UK. I guess the same policies that failed in the US will fail in the United Kingdom.”The diplomat made the remarks after Britain delivered a volley of threatening messages to Iran in response to its seizure last Friday of a UK-flagged tanker. Stena Impero was captured and an investigation initiated after the tanker collided with an Iranian fishing boat in the Persian Gulf and refused to respond to its distress call.Zarif said Iran acted against Stena Impero only after the UK flouted maritime regulations.“The UK ship had turned down its signal for more time than it was allowed to [and] was passing through the wrong channel, endangering the safety and security of shipping and navigation in the strait of Hormuz, for which we are responsible,” he said.Nathalie Loiseau, the former leader of Macron’s party in the European parliament, said the two priorities were de-escalation and monitoring in the strait of Hormuz. Speaking on BBC World Tonight, she said: “What I find extremely interesting when a British ship has been seized – and it’s a question of high concern in the UK and rightly – there is this reflex to call the Europeans. At the very moment when you are talking about Brexit you can see we have common threats and have common ways of assessing threats.“I listened carefully to the foreign secretary saying the initiative he has in mind is very different from the American initiative of a policy of maximum pressure.”Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin in Brussels",Iran rejects UK's proposal for European-led maritime

"The UK must be responsible for the safety of its own ships in the Gulf, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said.His remarks reflect unresolved tensions between Britain and the US over Donald Trump’s plans for a US-led military taskforce to protect international shipping operating off the Iranian coast. The UK is meanwhile seeking to assemble a European naval protection force.Speaking on Fox News, Pompeo said: “The responsibility in the first instance falls to the United Kingdom to take care of their ships. The US has a responsibility to do its part.” He argued that the current crisis was not a result of US sanctions, but of longstanding Iranian malign behaviour in the region. “This is a bad regime; it’s not honouring the people of Iran,” he told the Fox & Friends television programme. “They’ve now conducted what amounts to national piracy – a nation-state taking over a ship that’s travelling in international waters.”British ministers discussed the issue at a Cobra emergency meeting that largely focused on how to respond to the Iranian capture on Friday of the British-flagged Stena Impero. The ship, crewed largely by Indian nationals, is being held in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. All crew members are in good health and still onboard, the Iran embassy in India said on Monday.The detention comes at a time of high tension in the region, with US, British and Iranian forces facing off at sea.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, spoke to his German and French counterparts on Sunday to urge them to recognise the need to internationalise the maritime security operation in the Gulf.The US has been seeking to recruit allies to take part in a coalition, known as Operation Sentinel, to protect the sea lanes. “We’ll build out a big coalition of countries all across the world to do that. We’ll ultimately be successful,” Pompeo told CBS News.Hunt told parliament on Monday that he was seeking to develop a maritime protection mission with Germany, France and other European nations, but not including the US, because of their different agendas. The foreign secretary pointed out that the Europeans were not part of the US “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran.Donald Trump said that recent events had made him less willing to do a deal with Tehran. “They put their finger up in the air and disrespected the United States. They shouldn’t have done that,” the president said. “Frankly it’s getting harder for me to make a deal with Iran because they behave very badly. They say bad things. I’ll tell you, it could go either way.”A spokesman for the prime minister, Theresa May, said: “We already work closely with international partners to ensure a coordinated effort to defend freedom of navigation … The high volume of ships moving through the strait of Hormuz – up to 30 ships covering more than 100 nautical miles – makes it impossible to escort vessels individually”.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.

Tensions in the Gulf had already affected oil trading, and Friday’s tanker seizures caused prices to rise.Britain has concerns that a US-led maritime security operation may have a different emphasis since Trump wants Europeans to join the US in pulling out of the nuclear deal signed in 2015.The UK has already advised all British-flagged ships not to enter the Strait of Hormuz until the crisis is resolved. There are eight British-flagged ships in the region at present.In his statement to MPs on Monday, Hunt vigorously defended the British decision to seize an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar on 4 July, insisting Britain – in cooperation with the US – had established that the ship entered British waters and was bound for Syria in breach of EU sanctions.Iran says it is not party to EU sanctions on Syria, and points out that no ship previously heading for Syria has been impounded in this way. Iran claims the UK has in effect ended up supporting the US efforts to impose an Iranian oil export ban, a measure that the UK formally opposes as a supporter of the 2015 nuclear deal.There is an urgency about the security of British ships, since one option is for British-flagged ships to be reflagged to avoid them becoming a target of the Iranians, something that would deal a blow to the British shipping industry. There are about 4,500 ships registered with Britain or its overseas territories.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst 'chokepoint'In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Phillip InmanPompeo also dismissed Iran’s announcement that it had captured 17 spies working for the US Central Intelligence Agency and sentenced some to death.Iran made the announcement in state media, saying the alleged spies had been arrested in the 12 months to March 2019. Such announcements are not unusual in Iran, but the timing has raised concerns that Tehran is hardening its position in its standoff with western powers. “The Iranian regime has a long history of lying ... I would take with a significant grain of salt any Iranian assertion about actions that they’ve taken,” Pompeo said.Trump said on Monday that the Iranian claim was “totally a false story.”","UK must

"Twenty-one years ago, on my recommendation, the UN general assembly named 2001 the year of “dialogue among civilisations”, and signalled its commitment to peace and its rejection of war and violence. The Iranian people, despite their own historic grievances and troubled history, opened a hopeful new chapter of engagement and dialogue with the Great Powers (US, UK and Russia). These hopes, however, were dashed by the terrorist atrocities of 11 September, 2001 and their tragic aftermath in devastating wars in west Asia. The catastrophic wars of Iraq and Afghanistan and other interventions in the region exacerbated already extant problems, and paved the way for the growth of international terrorism, civil wars in Syria and Iraq, and the depredations and war crimes still unfolding in Yemen. These conflicts have made the region unsafe and have impinged on security around the world.The Middle East once again faces a crisis not of its own making; a crisis which was both unnecessary and avoidableIn the same period, the development of Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme became a test of the dialogue on peace. In order to build trust with the international community my administration sought dialogue, and after years of difficult and tumultuous negotiations, President Rouhani’s government succeeded in concluding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – known as the Iran nuclear deal – with six other world powers.Iran has repeatedly declared that it is not seeking to build a nuclear weapon. In addition to observing its obligations under the non-proliferation treaty (NPT), as a gesture of goodwill Iran accepted the JCPOA’s measures to ensure transparent verifiability of the peaceful nature of its civilian nuclear programme. The successful conclusion of the JCPOA was a major achievement which showed that reciprocity and mutual trust between Iran and the E3+3 were not only possible, but desirable. Furthermore, it acted as an important basis on which to build, containing within it the prospect of more fruitful and positive relations between our respective nations in the future. Sadly, Iran was the only country to abide by all the provisions of the JCPOA, while the other signatories have either breached or shirked their responsibilities under its terms.While Iran was playing a decisive role in defeating the Islamic State’s reign of terror, the Trump administration decided to initiate a new round of hostilities against my country by illegally withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, violating UN security council resolution 2231 that the US had itself jointly sponsored, and waging a campaign of economic sanctions against the Iranian people. President Trump is thus punishing Iran and indeed the world community not for violating the JCPOA, but for complying with this UN-sanctioned international legal agreement. By exiting the JCPOA, the Trump administration has moved against the very principles of dialogue, engagement and coalition-building. It has spurned the cause of peace. Unrelenting sanctions and what is effectively a blockade on Iran impose collective punishment on a nation that has done absolutely nothing wrong. The present US administration is ratcheting up tensions in the Persian Gulf, making a conflagration or even a full-scale war between our two countries increasingly likely.But the reimposition of brutal sanctions and renewed military threats will not force the Iranian government or my people into submission. Sanctions, like terrorism, are indiscriminate in their targets and ruinous in their consequences.Today, the Middle East once again faces a crisis not of its own making; a crisis which was both unnecessary and avoidable. It doesn’t have to be this way, and escalating tensions can still be defused. Cool heads must prevail if the region is not going to find itself dragged into yet another violent maelstrom. This cycle of imperious unilateralism and the substitution of military solutions for political ones must stop, and the US administration must respect its international obligations by choosing dialogue over coercive diplomacy and threats of war.As someone who has made it his life’s mission to defend the dialogue of cultures and civilisations, world peace, democracy, tolerance and human rights, I express my deep concern for the future of the Iranian nation and other nations of our region. It is in this spirit that I call on people of conscience in the US and across the world to promote peace and “dialogue among civilisations” instead of promoting the idea of a “clash of civilisations”. We must form a #CoalitionForPeace that says #NoWarWithIran to prevent disaster. With a view to the acute level of tensions in the Persian Gulf region, the situation is both fragile and explosive.Despite the pressure coming from some of his advisers, President Trump still has the choice to reverse his administration’s unnecessary escalation. He should be aware that Iranians are steadfast. For well over a century since our 1905 constitutional revolution, Iranians have fought to preserve our dignity and independence. The JCPOA negotiating process was proof of Iran’s good faith and commitment to a respectful international peace. The question is whether the current US administration is willing to respond in kind, instead of continuing to issue insults and threats and using the kind of colonial language more befitting of 19th-century imperial administrators than a 21st-century world power.It is easy to destroy, but far harder to build. Obstacles to a lasting peace are real. But they are not insurmountable. We must be proactive in our advocacy for peace and dialogue for our own sake and that of future generations.

"The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is under intense pressure to join US-led plans for an international maritime protection force in the Gulf as signs grow that Iran is preparing for a long standoff over the British-flagged tanker it has detained.As Tehran signalled it would refuse to release the Steno Impero until the UK released an Iranian-flagged ship seized off the coast of Gibraltar a fortnight ago, the British government faced accusations it had failed to sufficiently guard its shipping in the Gulf.Adding to the tensions, the defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, said cuts had left the Royal Navy too small to manage Britain’s interests around the globe.Theresa May will chair a meeting of the government’s emergency committee Cobra at 10.30am BST. As well as receiving the latest updates from ministers and officials, the meeting will discuss the maintenance of the security of shipping in the Gulf. Hunt is due to make a statement to MPs on Monday afternoon.Senior Tory backbenchers including figures close to Boris Johnson, who is expected to become prime minister this week, are angry at the government’s reluctance to accept an offer from Washington to protect British vessels in the region. The capture of the Stena Impero on Friday was widely seen as an avoidable error for which ministers had ample warning.Iain Duncan Smith, a former minister tipped for a cabinet post in a Johnson administration, said the government needed urgently to answer the charge that it had made an error. He said genuine questions had been raised about the UK’s contingency planning after the UK seized the Iranian tanker, Grace 1, on 4 July. “If something didn’t send an alarm signal that we needed to have serious assets or protection and convoying of our vessels in that area then I want to know why not.”Duncan Smith said his sources had suggested Washington had invited the UK “to use US assets to support British shipping and they were not taken up at that point.” He said he wanted to know why additional UK assets were not speedily dispatched.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service. Saudi Arabia subsequently blames Iran for the attack.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It's not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: 'If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!'Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom's south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US 'spy' drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker, Grace 1, the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row. Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.Hunt is expected to announce limited sanctions directed against members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and to say that the UK is willing to join an international protection force on the right terms. It will also send air assets to the region.On Sunday evening, the Foreign Office confirmed Hunt had spoken with his French and German counterparts who agreed that a “safe passage for vessels” through the economically significant Strait of Hormuz was “a top priority” for Europe.The Foreign Office is seeking a diplomatic solution to the conflict but has advised all British-flagged ships not to enter the Strait of Hormuz.Bob Sanguinetti, the chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said: “We must restore confidence in the security of ships passing through the strait, and if this necessitates the deployment of more naval vessels from the international community, we would welcome that.”The Iranian government said the length of detention of the mainly Indian crew on Stena Impero depended on the degree of their cooperation. “We are required by regulations to investigate the issue,” Allahmorad Afifipour, the head of ports and maritime in Hormozgan province, told Iranian state TV.Afifipour said all 23 crew members from the ship were “safe and in good health”. The ship’s owners have asked to visit the crew.Iranian MPs meeting on Sunday welcomed the ship’s capture and made calls for the government to consider imposing tolls on all British and US shipping heading to the Strait, a move that would lead to naval confrontations since the strait is considered international waters.Iranian officials were explicit that the capture on Friday was in retaliation for the capture of Grace 1. The speaker of Iran’s parliament, Ali Larijani, said the British “stole and got a response” from the Revolutionary Guards.Britain privately admits it worked in conjunction with the US in the capture of Grace 1 but says it had independent intelligence that the ship contained oil bound for Syria, in violation of EU sanctions. It says the ship could not have been stopped had it not entered Gibraltarian waters.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst 'chokepoint'In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Phillip InmanIt is possible ministers underestimated the reaction, particularly since Iran did not attempt any reprisal when the British – unlike the French or Germans – blamed the Revolutionary Guards for an attack on two tankers last month.One Whitehall source admitted the government had considered turning a blind eye, admitting that an unworthy part of him had thought: “Let this cup pass from my lips.”Ellwood again demanded the release of the Stena Impero, a call echoed by Oman in whose waters the ship was captured.Speaking on Sky News, Elwood also made a stark call for a reversal of defence cuts. He said: “If we want to continue playing a role on the international stage – bearing in mind that threats are changing, all happening just beneath the threshold of all-out war – then we must invest more in our defence.”Britain has been nervous of the rules of engagement of the US’s long-touted plan for an international maritime security force, nicknamed Operation Sentinel. There is already a UN-endorsed anti-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia, while combined taskforces already operate in the Gulf, dedicated to security and fighting drug-smuggling.There are also issues about the funding of any new larger operation proposed by US Central Command. But, most of all, Britain fears US-led convoys in the Gulf could by accident turn from something passive and defensive into something more volatile.Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, said on Sunday that the US national security adviser, John Bolton, “having failed to lure Donald Trump into war of the century … is turning his venom against the UK in hopes of dragging it into a quagmire.”Iran’s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, said on Twitter that Britain needed to contain “those domestic political forces who want to escalate existing tension between Iran and the UK well beyond the issue of ships”. There is an awareness in Iranian circles that the a Johnson premiership could lead to the UK weakening its support for the nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew last year.Meanwhile Iran said it had arrested 17 Iranian nationals allegedly recruited by the CIA to spy on the country’s nuclear and military sites. Some of them have already been sentenced to death, Tehran claimed.",Jeremy Hunt under pressure to back plan for Gulf force as Iran digs in,2019-07-22/07:51:45,the british foreign secretary jeremy hunt

"It was like something out of a movie. To shouts of Allahu Akbar!, masked soldiers drop down ropes from a military helicopter on to a British oil tanker while Iranian navy speedboats surround the vessel. By radio, a voice warns the ship’s captain in English: “If you obey you will be safe”. There is no doubt that the Friday seizure by Iranian Revolutionary Guards of a British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, was in part a piece of theatre intended to appease domestic clamour for Tehran to assert itself. It came in response to the UK military’s 4 July detention of an Iranian tanker, the Grace 1, in Gibraltar, allegedly for shipping oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. But the tit-for-tat response should also be evaluated as part of the Iranian attempt to push back against Donald Trump’s unilateral abandonment of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and his reimposition of economic sanctions.It is not clear if this strategy will do much to convince an exasperated Iranian public suffering under sanctions. It is also fraught with risks of escalation, threatening to further complicate UK-Iran bilateral relations and endanger wider European efforts to save the JCPOA, the international deal that committed Iran to strict curbs on its nuclear programme, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The risks are, at the moment, seen by Tehran as a necessary gamble to improve its international leverage if dipomatic negotiations resume. Two weeks of fruitless mediation efforts to release the Grace 1 prompted Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei to state: “The Islamic Republic and its committed forces will not leave this evil without a response.” It seems the Stena Impero is a pawn in a bigger game.Iran blames the Trump administration for influencing and coordinating the seizure of its tanker. Iran has a point: this crisis is inextricably linked to the wider effort by US hardliners to pressure Iran. Having unilaterally withdrawn from the JCPOA and reimposed sanctions, Washington’s actions have undoubtedly lead to the escalatory ripple effects now playing out in the Strait of Hormuz.The Stena Impero is a bargaining chip for the release of the Grace 1Over the past year the countries known as the E3 – France, Germany and the UK – have tried in vain to save the JCPOA. Faced with the loss of the promised material benefits of signing up to the deal, Iran has begun to marginally breach its nuclear commitments by increasing its levels of enriched uranium.Under siege from US sanctions and receiving limited tangible benefits from Europe, Tehran has chosen to up the ante and make the international community feel some of its pain. The Stena Impero is a bargaining chip for the release of the Grace 1. Other Iranian provocations – deliberate breaches of the JCPOA, the downing of a US drone, attacks on other tankers in the Gulf and the arrests of dual nationals – should be seen in the same context.Iranian policymakers are also taking a leaf from the perceived success of a 2005 confrontation that resulted in the acceleration of Iran’s nuclear programme, believed to have produced greater international concessions. Caught between US bullying and the frustration of Iranian nuclear transgressions, Europe has tried to pursue an independent approach. But if Iran continues to escalate it could provoke a greater European-US alignment than would be useful for itself. Indeed, the E3 have jointly condemned Iran’s actions and have called for the quick release of the ship.While Jeremy Hunt has warned Iran of “serious consequences”, it is important for the British response to be calibrated. Above all, the UK should avoid the temptation to align completely with Washington on Iran. Talk of sanctions and asset freezes will only put the nuclear deal and European efforts at further risk.Rather than conflating the ships and the nuclear crisis, a direct UK-Iran bilateral negotiation on the tankers could provide both sides with a face-saving outcome.

"Henry Kissinger, the former US diplomat and occasional adviser to the UK foreign secretary, once wrote: “Policy is the art of the possible, the science of the relative.”As the Foreign Office surveys the wreckage of its relations with Iran, even the possible seems unavailable to British diplomacy. There are few if any good options as Britain finds its alliances and strengths tested in a new dangerous context.Jeremy Hunt awaits a new prime minister, with a lingering hope in his heart it may yet be him but knowing in his head it will most likely be Boris Johnson, an unpredictable man with an instinct to favour the US over Europe. The foreign secretary has only the lukewarm support of Europe, not over the capture of the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero, for which there is solidarity, but for the UK’s original decision to seize the Iranian-flagged Grace 1 in Gibraltar. That action directly led to the Stena Impero being taken under the control of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards.Even the former British ambassador to Washington, Sir Peter Westmacott, has questioned the wisdom of seizing the ship in what looks like a belated bid to undermine President Bashar al-Assad, a man the UK has acknowledged will remain in power at the end of the Syrian civil war. Disregarding the legality of detaining Grace 1, which is a point of dispute, the Royal Marines landing on the vessel was the equivalent of putting a lighted match into a kerosene-laden tinderbox.Hunt also has the unreliable support of an American president whose intentions towards Iran are entirely different to those of the UK and whose actions over the past years have amounted to diplomatic vandalism, according to the outgoing UK ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch.Due to decades of defence cuts, something the foreign secretary abhors, Hunt does not truly have the ability to act as the representative of an independent naval power, yet he also fears how the US would lead a maritime security operation in the Gulf. No one quite knows what the terms of engagement might be. The US for instance has declared the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, something Europe has not done.Trump has probably shown by calling off an attack last month that he does not have the instinct for war with Tehran, but there are those around him who do. The former UK foreign secretary Jack Straw’s description of John Bolton as “off the wall” when it comes to Iran is likely to be shared by those in the Foreign Office.In the daily skirmishes for Trump’s ear, you can rarely predict who will win. Bolton modestly claims he is only the president’s national security adviser and not decision-maker, but every day is different in the White House.So in this confined space Britain, even now, probably wants to find a way to de-escalate the crisis. Some limited sanctions aimed at individuals in the Revolutionary Guards are inevitable. They will not at this stage represent a return to the kind of sanctions that existed before the 2015 joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPA) known as the Iran deal. Britain’s outgoing chancellor, Philip Hammond, admitted as much on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show.Negotiations – hampered by the legalities – will commence over the release of Grace 1 from Gibraltar and could end up in the UK high court.But the British insist there is no moral equivalence between the two incidents. Hunt says Grace 1 was lawfully seized to enforce EU sanctions and even now the Iranians refuse to give an undertaking that if released it will not recommence heading for Syria. Stena Impero by contrast was captured unlawfully carrying out legitimate business.Efforts will be stepped up to protect British merchant shipping in the Gulf, perhaps belatedly, but the question of whether the US should lead a protection force remains unanswered. Already Atlanticists such as Iain Duncan Smith are demanding to know if a US offer of maritime assistance was rejected by the British. The UK on its own is self-evidently struggling and there is talk of providing additional support from the RAF.There are also diplomatic deadlines ahead. The joint commission of the JCPA is due to meet shortly at political director level to discuss Iran’s suspended commitments to the nuclear deal, including its enriching of uranium beyond agreed levels. So far Britain, France and Germany have admonished Iran for these breaches, but said last Monday they did not yet warrant triggering the agreement’s formal disputes mechanism. The JCPA permits Iran to take these steps if it believes one of the signatories is not meeting its commitments under the agreement.On the other side of the ledger, the EU could increase the credibility of Instex, the barter mechanism established by the bloc to help humanitarian trade between Europe and Iran in a way that might circumvent US secondary sanctions. But this is largely a sticking plaster. The big strategic decision, and this awaits the new prime minister, is whether to believe the JCPA can be salvaged.It looks like Europe can keep the JCPA on life support for only a little longer, with the pressure coming from the US proving too great.The major task for the new prime minister will be to sit down with Trump and urge him to clarify what he is trying to achieve in Iran: constraints on its nuclear ambitions or its regional submission. Trump needs a more credible explanation of what success looks like. Advice is the traditional British role. A Foreign Office memorandum from 1944 cited this weekend by David Reynolds, a Cambridge University professor of international history, read: “It must be our purpose to make use of American power for purposes we regard as good,” adding that “if we go about our business in the right way we can help steer this great unwieldy barge, the United States of America, into the right harbour”.With the ships

"John Bolton, White House national security adviser and notorious Iraq-era hawk, is a man on a mission. Given broad latitude over policy by Donald Trump, he is widely held to be driving the US confrontation with Iran. And in his passionate bid to tame Tehran, Bolton cares little who gets hurt – even if collateral damage includes a close ally such as Britain.So when Bolton heard British Royal Marines had seized an Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar on America’s Independence Day, his joy was unconfined. “Excellent news: UK has detained the supertanker Grace I laden with Iranian oil bound for Syria in violation of EU sanctions,” he exulted on Twitter.Bolton’s delighted reaction suggested the seizure was a surprise. But accumulating evidence suggests the opposite is true, and that Bolton’s national security team was directly involved in manufacturing the Gibraltar incident. The suspicion is that Conservative politicians, distracted by picking a new prime minister, jockeying for power, and preoccupied with Brexit, stumbled into an American trap.In short, it seems, Britain was set up.The consequences of the Gibraltar affair are only now becoming clear. The seizure of Grace I led directly to Friday’s capture by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards of a British tanker, the Stena Impero, in the Strait of Hormuz. Although it has not made an explicit link, Iran had previously vowed to retaliate for Britain’s Gibraltar “piracy”. Now it has its revenge.As a result, Britain has been plunged into the middle of an international crisis it is ill-prepared to deal with. The timing could hardly be worse. An untested prime minister, presumably Boris Johnson, will enter Downing Street this week. Britain is on the brink of a disorderly exit from the EU, alienating its closest European partners. And its relationship with Trump’s America is uniquely strained.Much of this angst could have been avoided. Britain opposed Trump’s decision to quit the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, the trigger for today’s crisis. It has watched with alarm as the Trump-Bolton policy of “maximum pressure”, involving punitive sanctions and an oil embargo, has radicalised the most moderate Iranians.Yet even as Britain backed EU attempts to rescue the nuclear deal, Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt, foreign secretary, tried to have it both ways – to keep Trump sweet. They publicly supported Washington’s complaints about Iran’s “destabilising” regional activities and missile programme, and berated Iran when it bypassed agreed nuclear curbs.Crucially, the government failed to significantly beef up protection for British-flagged vessels transiting the Gulf after attacks in May and June. This was partly because a depleted Royal Navy lacks capacity to mount adequate patrols. But it was also because officials feared that by raising its military profile, Britain could be sucked into armed conflict with Iran.For Bolton, however, drawing Britain unambiguously in on America’s side was a desirable outcome. So when US spy satellites, tasked with helping block Iranian oil exports in line with Trump’s global embargo, began to track Grace I on its way, allegedly, to Syria, Bolton saw an opportunity.The Spanish newspaper, El Pais, citing official sources, takes up the story: “The Grace 1, which flies a Panamanian flag, had been under surveillance by US satellites since April, when it was anchored off Iran. The supertanker, full to the brim with crude oil, was too big for the Suez Canal, and so it sailed around the Cape of Good Hope before heading for the Mediterranean.“According to the US intelligence services, it was headed for the Syrian oil refinery of Banias. Washington advised Madrid of the arrival of the supertanker 48 hours ahead of time, and the Spanish navy followed its passage through the Strait of Gibraltar. It was expected to cross via international waters, as many Iranian vessels do without being stopped.”Although Spanish officials, speaking after the event, said they would have intercepted the ship “if we had had the information and the opportunity”, Spain took no action at the time. But Bolton, in any case, was not relying on Madrid. The US had already tipped off Britain. On 4 July, after Grace I entered British-Gibraltar territorial waters, the fateful order was issued in London – it is not known by whom – and 30 marines stormed aboard.Iran’s reaction was immediate and furious. It claimed Britain had acted illegally because the EU embargo on oil supplies to Syria, which Hunt claimed to be upholding, applied only to EU states and not to third countries such as Iran. In any case, Tehran said, the ship’s destination was not Syria.Iran’s outrage was shared, to a lesser degree, by Josep Borrell, Spain’s socialist foreign minister. Borrell resented the British incursion into Gibraltar’s territorial waters, which Madrid does not recognise. He also appears to have been annoyed that Spain was drawn in – in Tehran, the Spanish ambassador had been summonsed by the foreign ministry to explain Madrid’s role. His reaction was to distance Spain from the affair. The Iranian tanker had been seized “following a request from the United States to the United Kingdom,” he said. And even though Britain was supposedly upholding EU regulations, the External Action Service, the EU’s foreign policy arm, has remained silent throughout.Iran’s retaliation in snatching the Stena Impero has further exposed Britain’s diplomatic isolation and its military and economic vulnerability. The government has advised British ships to avoid the Strait of Hormuz, an admission it cannot protect them. But between 15 and 30 British-flagged tankers transit the strait each day. If trade is halted, the impact on energy prices may be severe.Hunt’s appeal for international support for Britain has so far fallen on deaf ears, France and Germany excepted. China, Japan and other countries that rely on oil from the Gulf show no sign of helping. The US plan for a multinational coalition to protect Gulf shipping has few takers. Meanwhile, Trump’s promise to back Britain has scant practical value – and carries inherent dangers.The Bolton gambit succeeded. Despite its misgivings, Britain has been co-opted on to the front line of Washington’s confrontation with Iran. The process of polarisation, on both sides, is accelerating. The nuclear deal is closer to total collapse. And by threatening Iran with “serious consequences”, without knowing what that may entail, Britain blindly dances to the beat of Bolton’s war drums.",How Trump’s arch-hawk lured Britain into a

"The British government has summoned Tehran’s top diplomat in London and warned UK ships to temporarily avoid the strait of Hormuz after Iran seized a British-flagged tanker off its coast, deepening the crisis in the Gulf.The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said on Saturday that he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to express “extreme disappointment” over Iran’s actions, and vowed to protect UK ships during the crisis.“Having assured me last Sat[urday] Iran wanted to de-escalate the situation they have behaved in the opposite way,” Hunt said on Twitter. “This has to be about actions not words if we are to find a way through. British shipping must and will be protected.”A British Royal Navy frigate was just an hour from the scene when Iranian forces took control of the British-flagged Stena Impero, the defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, told Sky News. She said the tanker was in Omani waters at the time.Hunt earlier promised a robust response if the tanker was not released, but said the government was not contemplating military action.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted: “The UK tanker under Iranian control, and its crew, must be released. Escalation risks a deeper conflict, all sides must show restraint.“Trump tearing up the Iran nuclear deal has fuelled confrontation. Its negotiated reinstatement is essential to defuse threat of war in the Gulf.”Stena Bulk said in a statement: “Our insurers in the region have been in contact with the head of marine affairs at the Port of Bandar Abbas, who has reported that the crew members of our vessel Stena Impero are in ‘good health’ and that the tanker is at the nearby Bandar Bahonar anchorage.“The head of marine affairs has asked a formal request be made for a visit to be arranged to the crew members and vessel. I can confirm this formal request is being prepared forthwith.“Our insurers have also advised that the head of marine affairs has confirmed to them that no instructions have been received so far as to what will happen to the ship.”The Cobra emergency committee met on Saturday afternoon to discuss the crisis, the second such gathering in under 24 hours. The standoff between the west and Iran has escalated at a particularly difficult time for Britain, just four days before Theresa May is due to hand power to another leader.Iran’s charge d’affaires, the country’s most senior diplomat in London, was also summoned to the Foreign Office over the incident, the Press Association reported.Iran’s capture of the tanker and its 23 crew came two weeks after Royal Marines siezed an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar, on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria in violation of an EU embargo, and just hours after authorities in Gibraltar announced that they would extend their custody of the vessel.Friday’s action was widely seen as a response to the seizure of the Grace 1, which Tehran denounced as piracy carried out on the orders of Washington, and Iran on Saturday appeared to make the link explicit.“The rule of reciprocal action is well known in international law,” Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, a spokesman for Iran’s powerful Guardian Council, told the semi-official Fars news agency.Iran’s moves to “confront the illegitimate economic war and seizure of oil tankers is an instance of this rule and is based on international rights”, he added. The council rarely comments on state matters, but when it does it is seen as a reflection of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s views.Hunt said UK forces had followed international law. “Yesterday’s action in Gulf shows worrying signs Iran may be choosing a dangerous path of illegal and destabilising behaviour after Gibraltar’s legal detention of oil bound for Syria,” Hunt said on Twitter. “We have been trying to find a way to resolve Grace1 issue but will ensure the safety of our shipping.”A second Liberian-flagged but British operated tanker was also detained for several hours by Iranian forces on Friday. The Mesdar made a sudden diversion from its planned course, and began moving towards the Iranian coast before apparently turning off its tracking signal.Its Glasgow-based operator, Norbulk Shipping UK, confirmed that the vessel had been boarded by armed guards but had then been allowed to continue its voyage. Fars reported it was given a notice to meet environmental regulations.About a fifth of the world’s oil passes through the strait of Hormuz, the busiest shipping lane in the world for crude tankers, and under 25 miles (40km) wide at its narrowest point. Tensions in the Gulf had already affected oil trading, and Friday’s tanker seizures caused prices to rise.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service. Saudi Arabia subsequently blames Iran for the attack.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It's not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: 'If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!'Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom's south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US 'spy' drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker, Grace 1, the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row. Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.Iran’s official Irna news agency said the impounded Stena Impero had been detained after colliding with a fishing boat, whose crew notified authorities on land. Its owners say it was intercepted in international waters, by four small craft and a helicopter, when in “full compliance with all navigation and international regulations”.The ship has been taken to Bandar Abbas, one of the country’s main military ports, Fars reported.Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said if the report was correct, Britain should rule out the use of force in response. “That’s an important Iranian military port and I think any military options will therefore be extremely unwise,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Late on Friday night, the British government advised UK ships to stay out of the area “for an interim period” and said it was talking to international partners.France’s foreign ministry said on Saturday it was very concerned by the seizure of the Stena Impero, saying such an action harmed de-escalation efforts in the region. Germany’s foreign ministry said it was an “unjustifiable intrusion” on shipping through a key shipping route and urged Iran to release the ship and crew.“We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s unacceptable actions, which represent a clear challenge to international freedom of navigation,” a government statement said, following a meeting of ministers to discuss the incident in the strait of Hormuz.The detention comes at a time of high tension in the region, with US, British and Iranian forces facing off at sea. Iranian politicians have called for reprisals over the detention of the Grace 1.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards previously attempted to capture a British tanker six days after the Grace 1 was seized. On 10 July, a British warship, the HMS Montrose, intervened to drive off three Iranian military vessels that were attempting to divert a UK tanker, the British Heritage, towards Iranian territory.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst 'chokepoint'In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Phillip InmanThe battle of nerves along the oil export routes of the Gulf has involved other close encounters between Iranian, UK and US military forces. Earlier on Friday, Tehran denied Trump’s claim that US forces had downed an Iranian drone over the Gulf, although the US president was adamant.The prospect of a diplomatic resolution appeared to be receding however after a senior US official on Friday dismissed a nuclear offer proposed the previous day by Iran’s foreign minister.The official suggested the offer, made during a visit to New York, was not serious and called for “an actual decision-maker” to enter talks to “end Iran’s malign nuclear ambitions”.Trump has vacillated on what he wants Iran to do in return for a lifting of the oil and banking embargo that the US has imposed since walking out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran in May last year.The sharp response to Zarif’s offer suggests that administration hardliners, led by the national security adviser, John Bolton, are currently running Iran policy.",Iran's top diplomat in UK summoned over seizure of Stena Impero tanker,2019-07-20/15:41:42,the british government

"For a reputed “strongman”, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan seems unusually nervous these days. A bombastic speech last week marking the third anniversary of a failed military putsch could not conceal his insecurity. He says he is using his sweeping powers as executive president to build a “new Turkey”. But it appears the old one is tiring of him fast.“The 15th of July was an attempt to subject our nation to slavery,” Erdoğan declared. “But as much as we will never stop protecting our freedom and our future, those who lay traps for us will never cease their efforts.” It was a typical pitch, blending nationalism with scare stories of secret foes, foreign and domestic.Erdoğan remains convinced his enemies are out to get him – and in the manner of all dictators, conflates his personal prospects with those of the state. The latest villains in this self-centred drama are the country’s American and European allies who, as he tells it, seek to subjugate both him and the proudly rising Turkish nation. But freedom is a fungible concept in Erdoğan’s Turkey. Tens of thousands of supposed plotters have been jailed pending trial since 2016. More than 100,000 public sector workers have been suspended or sacked. Another purge preceded the coup anniversary, with more than 200 military personnel and civilians accused of treason.Particular concern is focused on Turkey’s justice system. Britain’s Law Society, citing the “widespread and systematic persecution of members of the legal profession”, has reported Turkey to the UN human rights council. Journalists have suffered similar intimidation. Most Turkish media now tamely toe the government line.Erdoğan has good cause to worry – but the real reason may be simpler: he has made a dreadful hash of things. During 16 consecutive years in power, Turkey’s modern caliph has driven the economy into chronic debt, played regional power-broker with chaotic results, and scapegoated the Kurds for his failures. Now the bill is coming due.Turkey remains in recession following last year’s calamitous currency crisis, amid fears a new financial crunch is imminent. Unemployment and inflation are high and business is slack. Erdoğan’s sacking last week of the central bank governor was seen as a sign he will persist with his discredited strategy of spurring growth with borrowed money.For the first time in years, his political grip is threatened. Erdoğan’s ruling AKP suffered local election losses in five of the six largest cities in March. He was humiliated again last month in Istanbul’s re-run mayoral election. And his monopoly on power makes it harder to shift responsibility to others.External affairs is another disaster area. Scoring a spectacular double last week, Erdoğan fell out with both the US and the EU in the space of a few days. In Washington’s case, the row was over Nato member Turkey’s decision to buy a Russian ground-to-air missile system. Some analysts suggest Erdoğan wanted to demonstrate Turkey’s independence. Others put it down to paranoia. He reportedly still suspects Washington of tacitly supporting the coup and protecting its US-based alleged leader, Fethullah Gülen. Whatever his motives, the missile purchase led the US to cancel a sale of F-35 jets and threaten more sanctions. The cost to the Turkish defence industry, which would have made some aircraft components, is put at $9bn. Bigger still, potentially, is the cost to Nato. The foreign ministry in Ankara warned on Wednesday of “irreparable damage”.Erdoğan’s always tense relations with the EU, strained by the Syrian refugee crisis, underwent a simultaneous rupture. After Ankara ignored Cypriot warnings not to drill for oil and gas in eastern Mediterranean waters that Nicosia claims as its own, EU foreign ministers imposed yet more sanctions. The notoriously combative Erdoğan has fallen out with many regional neighbours over the years, including Syria, Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia, not to mention Greece. To break with the US and Europe in the same week is some achievement, even by his choleric standards. Yet Erdoğan supporters claim it’s part of a deliberate plan to boost Turkey’s independent standing in the world.On this analysis, Erdoğan’s cosying up to Russia’s Vladimir Putin puts the US on notice that Turkey has strategic alternatives. It could help the economy, which needs Russian trade and tourism. And it suits Ankara’s policy in Syria where, despite being on opposite sides, Turkey has collaborated with Russia and Iran.But this apparent tilt towards Moscow may yet prove another big miscalculation. Erdoğan says he wants to stay friends with the US and be part of Nato – but has sowed grave doubts about his dependability. Meanwhile, Russian and Syrian regime forces have begun an offensive against rebels and Islamists in Idlib, Aleppo and Hama provinces, in north-west Syria. The offensive contravenes a ceasefire agreed with Erdoğan last September that set up a demilitarised zone inside Syria overseen by Turkey. Its forces were attacked in two separate incidents in May. Fighting in Idlib has since intensified amid renewed civilian atrocities.Russia and Syria aim to finally bring the civil war to an end by storming the last rebel areas. Erdoğan’s aim is to extend Turkish-controlled “safe areas” eastwards along the Turkey-Syria border in order to hold Kurdish “terrorists” at bay – and prevent another refugee exodus. These aims look increasingly incompatible.At odds with the US, Europe, his Arab neighbours and potentially Russia, too, and increasingly unpopular at home, no-mates Erdoğan is treading a lonely, destructive path towards a strategic and political dead end. The looming question is whether he will take Turkey down with him.",Erdoğan is on a lonely path to ruin.

"The morning after a group of 30 Royal Marines helped seize the Iranian-flagged Grace 1 in Gibraltar, tired Foreign Office officials did not look exactly jubilant. There was not exactly a sense of foreboding, but diplomats were aware of the wider bilateral consequences for British-Iranian relations.Now, with the capture of a British-owned oil tanker in the Gulf, some of their worst fears have been realised. The Stena Impero and its crew of more than 20 are now in the hands of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards – and the UK has been shown to be unable to protect British shipping going through the waterways of the strait of Hormuz.The British insist that they only impounded Grace 1 due its suspected destination – a port in Syria – not due to the fact that the ship was carrying Iranian oil. European Union sanctions against the regime of Bashir al Assad regime were there to be enforced and international law upheld, the British argued. There seemed little doubt, given its circuitous route, that the ship was bound for Syria.Yet there were some oddities to the British decision. Few previous shipments of oil to Syria have been impounded. The Spanish claim that the British acted under the instruction of the Americans. The Trump administration is trying to freeze all Iranian oil exports as part of its policy of maximum economic sanctions designed to force the Iranians to reopen talks on the nuclear deal signed in 2015.But Britain opposes that US policy, arguing that it is counterproductive and only likely to strengthen the hands of hardliners in Tehran.Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister and co-chair of the European council on foreign relations, pinpointed the ambiguities of the British action in Gibraltar: “The legality of the UK seizure of a tanker heading for Syria with oil from Iran intrigues me. One refers to EU sanctions against Syria, but Iran is not a member of the EU. And the EU as a principle doesn’t impose its sanctions on others. That’s what the US does.”To the Iranian eye, the British action had nothing to do with an EU embargo, and everything to do with an desire to support the US squeeze on Iranian oil exports, the quickest route to bringing the Iranian economy to its knees. Some reports estimate that Iranian exports are down to 200,000 barrels a month.Britain’s efforts to extricate itself started to emerge at the weekend, when Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, rang his Iranian opposite number, Javad Zarif, and said the ship could be released if there was an undertaking that the ship would no longer travel to Syria.But trust between Hunt and Zairif is low: Zarif feels let down by Hunt on a range of bilateral issues, including the case of Nazaninin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Iranian dual national imprisoned in Tehran.On a lightning tour of New York this week, Zarif insisted that Grace 1 was not bound for Syria, but to another destination in the Meditternnean that hewould not identify. He refused to give the assurances that Hunt had sought, saying Iran was not going to reveal how it was trying to avoid the US oil embargo.But the British clearly thought a deal was possible, and pressure was coming from Britain’s European partners to settle the issue. Hunt asked Gibraltar’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, to come to the UK at short notice to meet not just Theresa May, but Boris Johnson and himself. Talks were also held between Iranian officials and Gibraltar in the foreign office on Thursday.Picardo continued to insist that the talks had been constructive. Some kind of diplomatic form of words seemed imminent that would satisfy all but the US.Instead – to the frustration of the Iranians – at a briefing hearing on Friday morning, the Gibraltar court extended the detention of the Grace 1 for 30 days. The 2.1m barrels of oil remain in British hands.The process had been held against a backdrop of increasing threats from Iran that it would respond in kind to what it saw as “an act of piracy, pure and simple”.These warnings in some cases were not veiled, but explicit. Although the British were trying to increase the scale of Royal Navy maritime protection to British merchant shipping, the progress was inevitably slow.In the end, the British-flagged tanker was a sitting duck, and now the consequences are plain for all to see. Not just oil, but crew are now hostage, and diplomats can only ponder in retrospect whether the right judgments were made.",Gulf crisis: story began with UK's seizure of Iranian-flagged ship in Gibraltar,2019-07-20/00:26:33,the morning after a group of  royal marines helped seize the iranian flagged grace  in gibraltar tired foreign office officials did not look exactly jubilant there was not exactly a sense of foreboding but diplomats were aware of the wider bilateral consequences for british iranian relations now with the capture of a british owned oil tanker in the gulf some of their worst fears have been realised the stena impero and its crew of more than  are now in the hands of the iranian revolutionary guards and the uk has been shown to be unable to protect british shipping going through the waterways of the strait of hormuz the british insist that they only impounded grace  due its suspected destination a port in syria not due to the fact that the ship was carrying iranian oil european union sanctions against the regime of bashir al assad regime were there to be enforced and international law upheld the british argued there seemed little doubt given its circuitous route that the ship was bound for syria yet there were some oddities to the british decision few previous shipments of oil to syria have been impounded the spanish claim that the british acted under the instruction of the americans the trump administration is trying to freeze all iranian oil exports as part of its policy of maximum economic sanctions designed to force the iranians to reopen talks on the nuclear deal signed in  but britain opposes that us policy arguing that it is counterproductive and only likely to strengthen the hands of hardliners in tehran carl bildt the former swedish prime minister and co chair of the european council on foreign relations pinpointed the ambiguities of the british action in gibraltar the legality of the uk seizure of a tanker heading for syria with oil from iran intrigues me one refers to eu sanctions against syria but iran is not a member of the eu and the eu as a principle doesn t impose its sanctions on others that s what the us does to the iranian eye the british action had nothing to do with an eu embargo and everything to do with an desire to support the us squeeze on iranian oil exports the quickest route to bringing the iranian economy to its knees some reports estimate that iranian exports are down to   barrels a month britain s efforts to extricate itself started to emerge at the weekend when jeremy hunt the foreign secretary rang his iranian opposite number javad zarif and said the ship could be released if there was an undertaking that the ship would no longer travel to syria but trust between hunt and zairif is low zarif feels let down by hunt on a range of bilateral issues including the case of nazaninin zaghari ratcliffe the iranian dual national imprisoned in tehran on a lightning tour of new york this week zarif insisted that grace  was not bound for syria but to another destination in the meditternnean that hewould not identify he refused to give the assurances that hunt had sought saying iran was not going to reveal how it was trying to avoid the us oil embargo but the british clearly thought a deal was possible and pressure was coming from britain s european partners to settle the issue hunt asked gibraltar s chief minister fabian picardo to come to the uk at short notice to meet not just theresa may but boris johnson and himself talks were also held between iranian officials and gibraltar in the foreign office on thursday picardo continued to insist that the talks had been constructive some kind of diplomatic form of words seemed imminent that would satisfy all but the us instead to the frustration of the iranians at a briefing hearing on friday morning the gibraltar court extended the detention of the grace  for  days the  m barrels of oil remain in british hands the process had been held against a backdrop of increasing threats from iran that it would respond in kind to what it saw as an act of piracy pure and simple these warnings in some cases were not veiled but explicit although the british were trying to increase the scale of royal navy maritime protection to british merchant shipping the progress was inevitably slow in the end the british flagged tanker was a sitting duck and now the consequences are plain for all to see not just oil but crew are now hostage and diplomats can only ponder in retrospect whether the right judgments were made ,Iran Sanctions,0.239628717
"Iran seized two oil tankers – one registered in the UK, the other in Liberia – in the strait of Hormuz on Friday, marking a dramatic escalation in the worsening standoff in the Gulf.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards claimed to have taken the British-flagged Stena Impero into port with its 23-strong crew, and Iranian officials claimed it had infringed maritime regulations.On Saturday, the semi-official Iranian news agency, Fars, said the ship had been taken to Bandar Abbas port and that the crew remained on the vessel. Meanwhile, Iran’s state-run news agency, IRNA, reported that the tanker was seized due to a collision with an Iranian fishing boat. It said the fishing boat informed Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organisation, which notified the Revolutionary Guards.The Stena Impero’s owners however, said the ship had been “approached by unidentified small crafts and a helicopter during transit of the strait of Hormuz while the vessel was in international waters”.A second tanker, the Mesdar, which is Liberian-flagged but British operated, also made a sudden diversion from its course towards the Saudi port of Ras Tanura on Friday, and tracking data showed it moving northwards towards the Iranian coast before apparently turning off its tracking signal.Less than two hours later, the Mesdar’s tracking signal was turned back on. Fars, the semi-official Iranian news agency, reported that it was briefly detained in the strait of Hormuz and given a notice to comply with environmental regulations before being allowed to continue on its way.The Mesdar’s Glasgow-based operator, Norbulk Shipping UK, confirmed that the vessel had been boarded by armed guards but had then been allowed to continue its voyage. “All crew are safe and well,” it said.Stena Bulk and Northern Marine Management confirmed in a statement on Friday that the ship remained uncontactable.Stena Impero was in “full compliance with all navigation and international regulations” when it was intercepted, the company said.Stena Bulk chief executive Erik Hanell said: “There are 23 seafarers onboard of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality. There have been no reported injuries and the safety and welfare of our crew remains our primary focus.”Jeremy Hunt, the UK foreign secretary, told Sky News: “We are absolutely clear that, if this situation is not resolved quickly, there will be serious consequences.”But he added: “We are not looking at military options, we are looking at a diplomatic way to resolve the situation but we are very clear that it must be resolved.”He said that Stena Impero had been surrounded by four Iranian vessels with a helicopter hovering overhead, while 10 Iranian speedboats had converged on the Mesdar.“These seizures are unacceptable. It is essential that freedom of navigation is maintained and that all ships can move safely and freely in the region,” Hunt said.Late on Friday night, the British government advised UK ships to stay out of the area “for an interim period”.“We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s unacceptable actions which represent a clear challenge to international freedom of navigation,” a government statement said following a meeting of ministers to discuss the incident in the strait of Hormuz.“As the foreign secretary has said, our response will be considered and robust and there will be serious consequences if the situation is not resolved.“We remain in close contact with our international partners and there will be further meetings over the weekend.”Donald Trump, the US president, said on Friday night that the US would talk to Britain about the incidents.The Revolutionary Guards said they had seized the Stena Impero, citing international maritime law for their actions. Iran Front Page quoted an unnamed military source as saying the tanker had been “crossing a route other than the shipping lane in the strait of Hormuz, had switched off its transponders and did not pay any attention to Iran’s warnings when it was seized by the [Revolutionary Guards] forces”. The seizure of the tankers came hours after authorities in Gibraltar announced that they were extending their custody of the Iranian tanker, seized by Royal Marines on 4 July, on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria, in violation of an EU embargo. Tehran has denounced the detention of the Grace 1 as piracy carried out on orders from Washington. Iranian politicians have been calling for reprisals and the country’s forces, led by the Revolutionary Guards, are being increasingly aggressive in disrupting shipping lanes in the Gulf. The Stena Impero, a 30,000-tonne British-flagged and Swedish-owned ship, was heading for Saudi Arabia when it abruptly left international sea lanes, and tracking data showed it heading north towards the Iranian island of Qeshm, where the Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have a substantial base. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards previously attempted to capture a British tanker six days after the Grace 1 was seized. On 10 July, a British warship, the HMS Montrose, intervened to drive off three Iranian military vessels that were attempting to divert a UK tanker, the British Heritage, towards Iranian territory. The incidents come amid a battle of nerves along the oil export routes of the Gulf, which has involved close encounters between Iranian, UK and US military forces.Earlier on Friday, Tehran denied Trump’s claim that US forces had downed a Iranian drone over the Gulf. Iran’s top military spokesman said all drones had returned safely to base, but Trump was adamant. “No doubt about it ... we shot it down,” the US president said.Trump said on Thursday that the USS Boxer took defensive action after the unmanned vehicle came within 1,000 metres of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down. The prospect of negotiations that might defuse the standoff appeared more distant than ever on Friday as a senior US official dismissed a nuclear offer proposed the previous day by Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, during a visit to New York. The official suggested the offer was not serious and called for “an actual decision-maker” to enter talks to “end Iran’s malign nuclear ambitions”.Trump has vacillated on what he wants Iran to do in return for a lifting of the oil and banking embargo that the US has imposed since walking out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA) in May last year. The sharp response to Zarif’s offer suggests that administration hardliners, led by the national security adviser, John Bolton, are currently running Iran policy.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentZarif proposed that Iran’s parliament immediately ratify acceptance of a permanent regime of intrusive international inspections, known as the Additional Protocol, designed to ensure that Iran was not building nuclear weapons covertly. Iran is currently observing the protocol under the terms of the JCPOA, and was due to ratify it, cementing it into law, in October 2023.Zarif offered to bring that arrangement forward by more than four years in return for immediate sanctions relief. The offer was never likely to be accepted – the US has an expansive list of demands concerning Iran’s activities – but it did signal a willingness to do a deal with Washington outside the framework of the JCPOA. The US reaction, however, was scathing.“If Iran wants to make a serious gesture, it should start by ending uranium enrichment immediately and having an actual decision-maker attempt to negotiate a deal that includes a permanent end to Iran’s malign nuclear ambitions, including its development of nuclear-capable missiles,” a senior administration official said.Iran has consistently refused to give up uranium enrichment, which can be for both civilian and military purposes. Efforts by previous US administrations to stop it led to an exponential expansion of Iran’s enrichment capacity. The JCPOA accepted Iran’s right to enrich uranium, but imposed strict upper limits on its purity and other elements of the nuclear programme in return for sanction relief.With the negotiating gap between Washington and Tehran as wide as ever, the contest between the two countries has shifted increasingly to the Gulf. The Gibraltar supreme court’s extended the detention of the Grace 1 at a hearing on Friday after Gibraltar’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, held talks with Iranian officials at the Foreign Office. Picardo also held talks with Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary.The UK has been seeking legal assurances that the tanker would not travel to Syria to unload 2.1m barrels of oil if released, as it was suspected of attempting when detained.Tehran says it is not party to an EU embargo and insists that the ship was not bound for Syria. Bob Sanguinetti, the chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said: “We condemn unreservedly the capture of Stena Impero … Our priority is for the safety and welfare of the crew. We call on the UK government to do whatever is necessary to ensure their safe and swift return.“This incident represents an escalation. While we call for measured response, it is also clear that further protection for merchant vessels must be forthcoming to ensure enhanced security to guarantee free flow of trade in the region.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “Escalation risks a slide into an even deeper conflict. President Trump’s decision to tear up the Iran nuclear deal fuelled the risk of full-scale conflict. A negotiated reinstatement of the nuclear deal through the UN is essential to wind down tensions and defuse the threat of war in the Gulf.”",Iran stokes Gulf tensions by seizing two British-linked oil

the semi official iranian news agency fars said the ship had been taken to bandar abbas port and that the crew remained on the vessel meanwhile iran s state run news agency irna reported that the tanker was seized due to a collision with an iranian fishing boat it said the fishing boat informed iran s ports and maritime organisation which notified the revolutionary guards the stena impero s

iranian vessels with a helicopter hovering overhead while  iranian speedboats had converged on the mesdar these seizures are unacceptable it is essential that freedom of navigation is maintained and that all ships can move safely and freely in the region hunt said late on friday night the british government advised uk ships to stay out of the area for an interim period we remain deeply concerned

"Tensions between Iran and the west have deepened after Tehran denied a US warship had brought down one of its drones and a Gibraltar court extended the detention of an Iranian ship seized by Royal Marines following a breakdown in talks.The drone incident was first revealed by Donald Trump, who said that USS Boxer took defensive action after the unmanned vehicle came within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down.“The drone was immediately destroyed,” Trump said, adding that unmanned aircraft had threatened the safety of the American ship and its crew,. He called on other countries to condemn Iran and protect their own ships.“This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, facilities and interests, and calls upon all nations to condemn Iran’s attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation and global commerce.”However, Iran denied Trump’s claims. The deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, tweeted: “We have not lost any drone in the strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else. I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS [unmanned aerial system] by mistake!”The semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted a military spokesman, Gen Abolfazl Shekari, as sayingthat “all Iranian drones that are in the Persian Gulf and the strait of Hormuz […] have returned to their bases”.The contradictory claims came as Gibraltar’s supreme court extended the detention of the Iranian ship Grace 1 for 30 days, in a move that suggests talks between Iran and the UK over the terms of the ship’s release are not progressing.On Thursday, Gibraltar’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, held talks with Iranian officials at the UK foreign office in London. Picardo also held talks with Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary.The UK has been seeking legal assurances that the tanker, if released, will not travel to Syria to unload 2.1m barrels of oil.The Gibraltarian authorities, assisted by Royal Marines, seized the ship a fortnight ago declaring it was bound for Syria in breach of an EU embargo. The seizure was undertaken at the request of the US, Iran claims.Tehran says it is not party to an EU embargo and that the ship was not bound for Syria. The foreign minister, Javad Zarif, who was in New York on Thursday, has refused to offer an alternative destination for the ship, saying it was not in Iran’s interests to reveal how it could avoid a US-imposed embargo on Iranian oil exports. The UK foreign office remains certain the destination was Syria.The apparent breakdown in talks over the ship’s fate is a serious setback for efforts to de-escalate the wider crisis in the Gulf. The release of the ship might have set in train a virtuous circle, but instead it is likely to lead to calls within Iran to do more to disrupt western shipping travelling through the strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway that carries 60% of oil trade.Picardo has repeatedly stressed that talks between the unnamed Iranian officials and his team were constructive and positive. He also said the decision to seize the ship initially, and any decision on its release, was a matter for the Gibraltar authorities. In practice, the UK foreign office will have been influencing the tone of the discussions.Furthermore, the new standoff with the US came just hours after Iran offered a deal with Washington in which it said it would formally and permanently accept enhanced inspections of its nuclear programme in return for the permanent lifting of US sanctions.The offer was made by Zarif on his visit to New York. But it is unlikely to be warmly received by the Trump administration, which is currently demanding that Iran make a range of sweeping concessions, including the cessation of uranium enrichment and support for proxies and allies in the region.Zarif insisted, however, that his offer was “a substantial move”.“It’s not about photo ops. We are interested in substance,” he told reporters at the Iranian mission to the UN in New York on Thursday. “There are other substantial moves that can be made.”",Iran denies Trump claim that US destroyed drone over Gulf,2019-07-19/13:38:12,tensions between iran and the west have deepened after tehran denied a us warship had brought down one of its drones and a gibraltar court extended the detention of an iranian ship seized by royal marines following a breakdown in talks the drone incident was first revealed by donald trump who said that uss boxer took defensive action after the unmanned vehicle came within   yards of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down the drone was immediately destroyed trump said adding that unmanned aircraft had threatened the safety of the american ship and its crew he called on other countries to condemn iran and protect their own ships this is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by iran against vessels operating in international waters the united states reserves the right to defend our personnel facilities and interests and calls upon all nations to condemn iran s attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation and global commerce however iran denied trump s claims the deputy foreign minister abbas araqchi tweeted we have not lost any drone in the strait of hormuz nor anywhere else i am worried that uss boxer has shot down their own uas unmanned aerial system by mistake the semi official tasnim news agency quoted a military spokesman gen abolfazl shekari as sayingthat all iranian drones that are in the persian gulf and the strait of hormuz have returned to their bases the contradictory claims came as gibraltar s supreme court extended the detention of the iranian ship grace  for  days in a move that suggests talks between iran and the uk over the terms of the ship s release are not progressing on thursday gibraltar s chief minister fabian picardo held talks with iranian officials at the uk foreign office in london picardo also held talks with theresa may and jeremy hunt the foreign secretary the uk has been seeking legal assurances that the tanker if released will not travel to syria to unload  m barrels of oil the gibraltarian authorities assisted by royal marines seized the ship a fortnight ago declaring it was bound for syria in breach of an eu embargo the seizure was undertaken at the request of the us iran claims tehran says it is not party to an eu embargo and that the ship was not bound for syria the foreign minister javad zarif who was in new york on thursday has refused to offer an alternative destination for the ship saying it was not in iran s interests to reveal how it could avoid a us imposed embargo on iranian oil exports the uk foreign office remains certain the destination was syria the apparent breakdown in talks over the ship s fate is a serious setback for efforts to de escalate the wider crisis in the gulf the release of the ship might have set in train a virtuous circle but instead it is likely to lead to calls within iran to do more to disrupt western shipping travelling through the strait of hormuz the narrow waterway that carries  of oil trade picardo has repeatedly stressed that talks between the unnamed iranian officials and his team were constructive and positive he also said the decision to seize the ship initially and any decision on its release was a matter for the gibraltar authorities in practice the uk foreign office will have been influencing the tone of the discussions furthermore the new standoff with the us came just hours after iran offered a deal with washington in which it said it would formally and permanently accept enhanced inspections of its nuclear programme in return for the permanent lifting of us sanctions the offer was made by zarif on his visit to new york but it is unlikely to be warmly received by the trump administration which is currently demanding that iran make a range of sweeping concessions including the cessation of uranium enrichment and support for proxies and allies in the region zarif insisted however that his offer was a substantial move it s not about photo ops we are interested in substance he told reporters at the iranian mission to the un in new york on thursday there are other substantial moves that can be made ,Iran Sanctions,0.27473262
"Fears for maritime security in the strait of Hormuz, a vital route for oil shipping, have grown after Iran announced it had impounded a foreign tanker it said was smuggling fuel in the Gulf.State television quoting Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said the vessel was intercepted south of Iran’s Larak Island on Sunday after issuing a distress call.“A foreign vessel smuggling 1m litres of fuel in the Larak Island of the Persian Gulf has been seized,” the station said. “The vessel that Iran towed to its waters after receiving a distress call was later seized with the order from the court as we found out that it was smuggling fuel.”The Iranians did not initially identify the ship or its owners, but semi-official news agencies suggested the ship was the Panamanian-flagged MT Riah, a ship that went missing on 14 July and appeared to have been taken into Iranian waters in the strait of Hormuz.Nothing has been heard of the ship since it stopped transmitting its location in the early hours of Sunday. Iran did confirm on Tuesday, without naming Riah, that it had helped tow an unidentified ship in distress, but gave no further details.The Revolutionary Guards said in the latest statement that the vessel had been impounded “with an order from the court as we found out that it was smuggling fuel” to foreign ships. The ship is capable of carrying 2m litres and had 12 crew on board. It said it had not impounded any other ship.Speaking to reporters in New York, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, dismissed the incident as a routine marine policing matter.He said: “It’s not a tanker. It’s a small ship carrying a million litres, not a million barrels, of oil. We do it every other day. These are people who are smuggling our fuel. This is … one of the things that we do in the Persian Gulf, because of the heavy subsidies that we provide for our own fuel products.”In the current heightened tensions, western diplomats will fear the seizure of the ship is an Iranian attempt to exert diplomatic pressure.Giorgos Beleris, oil research manager for Refinitiv, said that, although Riah was small for a tanker and could dock easily, it had been recently operating at anchorages. “This could hint at something potentially shady – we can’t be certain,” he said.The UK Foreign Office said it was seeking further information on the ship and insisted that freedom of navigation was paramount.The Iranian seizure could be seen as a tit-for-tat reaction to the seizure of the Iranian-owned and Indian-crewed Grace 1 tanker a fortnight ago by Royal Marines off Gibraltar.On Thursday, the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and Boris Johnson, the expected new prime minister, held talks with Gibraltar’s first minister, Fabian Picardo, to discuss what to do about the Grace 1.Picardo revealed he had met with Iranian officials in London to discuss how “to de-escalate all issues arising”.In telephone talks with Zarif at the weekend, Hunt offered to release the ship if there was an undertaking that the ship’s oil would not be taken to Syria, a country that is subject to EU sanctions.The Iranians have said the ship was not bound for Syria, but has refused to name its planned destination.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.

Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row. Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.The UK is deeply sceptical of the Iranian explanation and is awaiting a clear undertaking that the ship will not be sailing to Syria.Unlike the US, the UK has no general policy of trying to block Iranian oil sales, but Tehran regards the British action as part of an attempt to support the US campaign to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero.The disputes over the ships are all part of wider manoeuvring between Iran, Europe and the US over the future of the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015 and known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPA).Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal a year ago, saying its terms did not restrict Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb, but the Europeans have continued to back the deal.Iran has started to lessen its commitments to JCPOA in the past month in protest at what it regards as the EU’s failure to set up an effective mechanism between Iran and Europe to maintain trade. An increase in trade with Europe was always seen by Iran as a central benefit of signing up to the restrictions imposed in the nuclear deal.The seizure of the latest ship, following a series of attacks and interruptions of shipping over the last fortnight in the Gulf, will put the issue of maritime security in the strait of Hormuz back at the heart of international discussions.In the last months there have been six unattributed attacks on Gulf shipping as well as an attempt to intercept a British ship in the Gulf a fortnight ago.The US has sent advanced fighter jets and thousands of extra troops into the Middle East, while attacks on oil tankers and the shooting down of a US military surveillance drone by Iran have added to the fears of armed conflict.The US has been pushing for an internationally coordinated maritime force to accompany cargo through the strait, and Bahrain has agreed to hold a conference to develop these plans. The Bahrain conference is not due to be held until October and as many as 60 nations are expected to attend.Referring to the US plans to install surveillance and protection for ships passing through

bomb but the europeans have continued to back the deal iran has started to lessen its commitments to jcpoa in the past month in protest at what it regards as the eu s failure to set up an effective mechanism between iran and europe to maintain trade an increase in trade with europe was always seen by iran as a central benefit of signing up to the restrictions imposed in the nuclear deal the seizure of the latest ship following a series of attacks and interruptions of shipping over the last fortnight in the gulf will put the issue of maritime security in the strait of hormuz back at the heart of international discussions in the last months there have been six unattributed attacks on gulf shipping as well as an attempt to intercept a british ship in the gulf a fortnight ago the us has sent advanced fighter jets and thousands of extra troops into the middle east while attacks on oil tankers and the shooting down of a us military surveillance drone by iran have added to the fears of armed conflict the us has been pushing for an internationally coordinated maritime force to accompany cargo through the strait and bahrain has agreed to hold a conference to develop these plans the bahrain conference is not due to be held until october and as many as  nations are expected to attend referring to the us plans to install surveillance and protection for ships passing through the gulf brian hook the us special representative on iran said washington had already sent an aircraft carrier and b  bombers to the region adding that the move has disrupted and deterred much of what we feared with iranian plots in the area hook said he would meet ambassadors on friday to promote the us plan to build a maritime coalition to deter further attacks on oil tankers in the gulf ,Iran

"Gibraltar’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, has flown to London to hold talks with Theresa May about the possible release of an Iranian-owned tanker that was seized a fortnight ago by the Royal Marines.The detention of the Grace 1 and its cargo of 2.1m barrels of oil, which was believed to have been headed to Syria in breach of EU sanctions, has turned into a focal point of severe friction between Tehran and London as Iran threatens to take further steps way from the nuclear deal it signed in 2015 with the US, China, Russia and 3 EU states.The UK has been under pressure from some European and Gulf allies to release the ship. Suggested by the US, the capture occurred on 4 July when the ship unexpectedly put down an anchor in what the UK regards as its waters. Spain monitored the capture.Iranian sources say its intermediaries took up a weekend offer from Picardo to meet to discuss the situation.Speaking in the Commons, the UK’s Middle East minister, Andrew Murrison, said decisions about the Panamanian-flagged tanker were a matter for Picardo. But in reality the Foreign Office will have influence over the key strategic decisions around whether the retention of the ship is either legally or diplomatically wise.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, following consultations with Picardo and the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, offered on Saturday to release the ship as long as Iran gave assurances that the ship’s oil was not bound for Syria, or any other entity under EU sanctions.In a statement, Picardo said: “We would be prepared to facilitate the release of the detained assets to the rightful owner if we received guarantees that it would not be going to Syria.”Speaking to the BBC’s Hardtalk programme in New York on Monday, Zarif said the ship had never been bound for Syria, but would not identify the true destination.He said: “We announced from the very beginning this ship was not going to Syria.” Asked where it was going, he said: “It was going to a place in the Mediterranean other than Syria. We made it clear.”Iran has been exporting oil to western Turkey, and looked to have resumed oil sales to Syria after a gap of more than a year in March this year.Zarif said he would “do anything to avoid the US knowing what we are doing”, pointing out that the US was unilaterally attempting to force Iran back to the negotiating table by trying to impose an unprecedented ban all Iranian oil exports. “The UK by confiscating our ship is helping the US in imposing its illegal oil sanctions against Iran,” said Zarif.It is not clear if Iran has been able to give stronger assurances through other private diplomatic channels that would satisfy the Gibraltar supreme court about the oil’s destination.Iran believes it is not party to the EU sanctions on Syria, one of its close allies, and has described the ship’s seizure as unlawful and an act of piracy.Some independent observers say it is unusual for the UK to have intervened to force a non-EU state to comply with EU sanctions.Gibraltar’s authorities arrested the Indian captain and first officer of the Grace 1, but have not pressed any charges.",Iran tanker capture: Gibraltar chief minister flies to UK for talks,2019-07-17/17:26:30,gibraltar s chief minister fabian picardo has flown to london to hold talks with theresa may about the possible release of an iranian owned tanker that was seized a fortnight ago by the royal marines the detention of the grace  and its cargo of  m barrels of oil which was believed to have been headed to syria in breach of eu sanctions has turned into a focal point of severe friction between tehran and london as iran threatens to take further steps way from the nuclear deal it signed in  with the us china russia and  eu states the uk has been under pressure from some european and gulf allies to release the ship suggested by the us the capture occurred on  july when the ship unexpectedly put down an anchor in what the uk regards as its waters spain monitored the capture iranian sources say its intermediaries took up a weekend offer from picardo to meet to discuss the situation speaking in the commons the uk s middle east minister andrew murrison said decisions about the panamanian flagged tanker were a matter for picardo but in reality the foreign office will have influence over the key strategic decisions around whether the retention of the ship is either legally or diplomatically wise the foreign secretary jeremy hunt following consultations with picardo and the iranian foreign minister javad zarif offered on saturday to release the ship as long as iran gave assurances that the ship s oil was not bound for syria or any other entity under eu sanctions in a statement picardo said we would be prepared to facilitate the release of the detained assets to the rightful owner if we received guarantees that it would not be going to syria speaking to the bbc s hardtalk programme in new york on monday zarif said the ship had never been bound for syria but would not identify the true destination he said we announced from the very beginning this ship was not going to syria asked where it was going he said it was going to a place in the mediterranean other than syria we made it clear iran has been exporting oil to western turkey and looked to have resumed oil sales to syria after a gap of more than a year in march this year zarif said he would do anything to avoid the us knowing what we are doing pointing out that the us was unilaterally attempting to force iran back to the negotiating table by trying to impose an unprecedented ban all iranian oil exports the uk by confiscating our ship is helping the us in imposing its illegal oil sanctions against iran said zarif it is not clear if iran has been able to give stronger assurances through other private diplomatic channels that would satisfy the gibraltar supreme court about the oil s destination iran believes it is not party to the eu sanctions on syria one of its close allies and has described the ship s seizure as unlawful and an act of piracy some independent observers say it is unusual for the uk to have intervened to force a non eu state to comply with eu sanctions gibraltar s authorities arrested the indian captain and first officer of the grace  but have not pressed any charges ,Iran Sanctions,0.264990151
"US officials suspect that a Panamanian-flagged oil tanker that stopped transmitting its location after straying into Iranian waters may have been hijacked by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards.Iran’s semi-official news agency ISNA said on Tuesday that the country’s navy came to the assistance of the Panamanian ship MT Riah after it had mechanical problems.“An international oil tanker was in trouble due to a technical fault in the Persian Gulf. After receiving a request for assistance, Iranian forces approached it and used a tugboat to pull it towards Iranian waters for the necessary repairs to be carried out,” ISNA said.US intelligence is concerned that the ship could have become a victim of Iranian manoeuvres intended to put pressure on Washington to lift crippling economic sanctions as it travelled through the strait of Hormuz, a vital route for oil shipping.The tracking report of the Panamanian ship MT Riah from MarineTraffic.com showed the vessel began its journey near a port off the coast of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, on 5 July. It was then tracked near the coast of Ras al-Khaimah before changing course and travelling north towards Iranian waters, after which it stopped transmitting its signal on Sunday at about 4.30am local time (0100 BST).Its last known location was in Iranian territorial waters near Qeshm Island, where the Revolutionary Guards have a base.Ranjith Raja, an analyst at Refinitiv, a data firm, said the tanker had not switched off its tracking in three months of trips around the UAE. “That is a red flag,” he said.The ship had been operating in the UAE between the cities of Sharjah and Fujairah over the past year and is owned by Prime Tankers, which operates out of Dubai.The UAE has said it does not own or operate the ship and no distress signals were sent. The UAE said it was working with its international partners to discover the ship’s location.Donald Trump did not comment on the tanker on Tuesday but claimed he was making a lot of progress with Iran and said he was not looking for regime change. He set conditions for talks including a withdrawal from Yemen. Iran denies it has any presence in the country.The uncertainty over the ship’s whereabouts follows previous unattributed attacks on Gulf shipping as well as an attempt to intercept a British ship in the Gulf a fortnight ago.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst 'chokepoint'In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Phillip InmanIt also followed the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker, Grace 1, off Gibraltar. Britain said Royal Marines had assisted in the capture of the ship because the oil was bound for Iran’s close ally Syria, in breach of an EU embargo. Iran has promised to retaliate against the British, but some of its former officials are said to be in Gibraltar trying to negotiate the ship’s release.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, said on Tuesday: “Evil Britain commits piracy and steals our ship ... and gives it a legal appearance. The Islamic Republic ... will not leave this wickedness unanswered and will respond to it at an appropriate time and place.”The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said at the weekend he was willing to release the ship if there were guarantees the oil would not be sent to Syria. European support for the seizure of the Grace 1 has been sparse, with some questioning the wisdom of opening up a new front with Iran at such a sensitive moment.Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, speaking in New York, criticised Britain as he pointed out that Iran was not under EU sanctions and was entitled to sell oil to any country not subject to UN sanctions. Iran’s unravelling nuclear deal with world powers has led to increased tensions in the Gulf region after the US pulled out last year and reimposed economic sanctions.The US has sent advanced fighter jets and thousands of extra troops into the Middle East while mysterious attacks on oil tankers and the shooting down of a US military surveillance drone by Iran have added to the fears of an armed conflict breaking out. The UK said on Tuesday it was sending a third frigate to the region, but that the decision was not linked to the Gulf crisis. Khamenei has for the first time warned that Tehran would continue removing restraints on its nuclear programme. The supreme leader accused Britain, Germany and France of failing to uphold their obligations under the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the west.“We abided by our commitments and even beyond them. Now that we’ve begun to reduce our commitments, they oppose it. How insolent! You didn’t abide by your commitments! We have started to reduce our commitments and this trend shall continue,” he said.International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors confirmed last week that Iran was enriching uranium to 4.5% fissile purity, above the 3.67% limit set by the nuclear deal, a second breach in as many weeks after Tehran exceeded limits on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium.But in a potential sign of flexibility about a future talks agenda with the US, Zarif for the first time said Iran would discuss its ballistic missile programme on condition that the US stopped selling weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In an interview with NBC, he said: “So if they want to talk about our missiles, they need first to stop selling all these weapons, including missiles, to our region.”The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, welcomed Zarif’s statement.Economic sanctions imposed on Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have cut into its ability to buy advanced weaponry abroad. It relies on pre-1979 US fighter jets and ageing Soviet MiGs, and has instead invested heavily in its ballistic missile programme.Khamenei has reportedly restricted the range of ballistic missiles manufactured in Iran to 1,240 miles. While that keeps Europe out of range, it means the missiles can hit much of the Middle East, including Israel and American military bases in the region.",Concern grows over oil tanker last seen off

"France has demanded immediate consular access to a senior French-Iranian academic who has been arrested in Iran.Fariba Adelkhah, a prominent researcher in anthropology and social sciences based at the Paris political institute Sciences Po, is believed to have been arrested in June.The detention risks increasing tension between Paris and Tehran at a critical moment in the crisis over Iran’s nuclear deal. European foreign ministers were meeting in Brussels on Monday in an attempt to preserve the deal, which the US abandoned unilaterally a year ago leading to an accelerating reciprocal withdrawal by Iran.The French foreign ministry said it had not yet been given “satisfactory” information on the status of Adelkhah, who is seen as one of France’s top academics on Iran.“The French authorities were recently informed of the arrest of Fariba Adelkhah,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. “France calls on the Iranian authorities to shed full light on Mrs Adelkhah’s situation and repeats its demands, particularly with regard to an immediate authorisation for consular access. No satisfactory response has been received until now.”Adelkhah is best known for her book Being Modern in Iran, about changes in the country after the 1979 Islamic revolution.Sciences Po, the elite political science institute where Adelkhah works, confirmed her arrest but refused to comment.Iranian opposition websites abroad have said Adelkhah disappeared in June. Iran’s state-run Irna news agency quoted a government spokesman as saying on Sunday that a dual national had been arrested, without elaborating. The spokesman, Ali Rabiei, said he could not confirm any information.Adelkhah is the latest Iranian national also holding a western passport to be arrested in Iran. The UK has advised dual nationals against travel to Iran, saying the “dangers they face include arbitrary detention and lack of access to basic legal rights”.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has been jailed in Tehran since 2016 on espionage charges. Dual Iranian-American nationals Siamak Namazi and his father, Baquer, are serving 10-year sentences for espionage in a case that has outraged Washington.Meanwhile, Xiyue Wang, a Chinese-American researcher at Princeton University, is serving a 10-year sentence for espionage, and a US national, Michael White, 46, was this year sentenced to 10 years.A French academic, Clotilde Reiss, was detained in Iran for 10 months in 2009-10 before being released in a case that attracted widespread attention at the time.At a similar time to Reiss’s release, French judicial authorities set free Ali Vakili Rad, who had been convicted of the 1991 murder outside Paris of the ousted shah’s former prime minister Shapour Bakhtiar. The timing led to speculation that a deal may have been struck between the countries over the prisoners, though French authorities denied any exchange.As news of the latest detention broke, European foreign ministers were fighting to save the Iran nuclear deal after Tehran’s announcements earlier this month that it would boost the enrichment level of uranium above agreed limits, breaking the terms of the landmark accord.The EU hopes it can persuade Iran to return to the deal, without triggering an investigation into Teheran’s decision to breach terms by enriching uranium.The bloc’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said none of the signatories to the deal considered the breaches to be significant, and so they would not be triggering its dispute mechanism which could lead to further sanctions.“All the steps that have been taken are reversible, so we hope and we invite Iran to reverse these steps and go back to full compliance with the agreement,” she said.Jeremy Hunt, the British foreign secretary, said there was a “closing but small window” to keep the deal alive. The UK foreign secretary warned that if Tehran acquired nuclear weapons, other countries in the region would too, leading to a “very toxic and dangerous situation”.As punishing US economic sanctions hit Iran’s economy, the EU has been attempting to craft a barter mechanism to allow European companies to continue trading with Iran.So far, 10 EU member states have agreed to take part in the Instex barter system, which allows companies to trade without money changing hands, in an attempt to avoid falling foul of US sanctions.Mogherini said the EU had not expected these measures would compensate Iran for economic losses incurred by the US decision to withdraw from the deal.“We are doing our best and we hope that this will be enough for the Iranian public opinion and the Iranian authorities to realise that as we are committed to the full implementation of the JCPOA [joint comprehensive plan of action, the Iran nuclear deal],” she said.",France demands access to dual-national academic held

"Jeremy Hunt’s well-publicised dash to Brussels to save the world from war with Iran will be seen by his more cynical opponents as a last-minute bid to save his Conservative leadership hopes. Before attending an EU foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday, Hunt declared portentously that the prospect of Middle Eastern states acquiring nuclear weapons posed “an existential threat to mankind”. That’s scary stuff, certainly deserving of a seasoned statesman’s full attention.Showboating aside, what the foreign secretary’s Brussels mission really demonstrates is that unilateral British efforts to defuse the Iran crisis have failed miserably. In particular, this failure has cruelly exposed the hollowness of Britain’s claims to wield special influence in Washington’s corridors of power. Donald Trump could not give a fig what Britain thinks. All efforts to change his mind (including two Boris Johnson trips to Washington as foreign secretary) have flopped.If Trump starts a shooting war, as he nearly did last month, Britain will be instantly stuck in the middle of the fightIf the Kim Darroch affair has any lasting significance, it is not the angry spat that followed the leaking of his private criticisms of Trump. It is the banality of the ambassador’s opinions. In characterising the administration as inept and dysfunctional, Darroch merely echoed the settled view of most independent Washington observers. He offered few insights, perhaps because he lacked any great degree of access. US policy on Iran, he wrote, was “incoherent”. No big surprise there.British attempts to influence Iran have been similarly unsuccessful. Hunt visited last November in a bid to bolster the 2015 nuclear deal after Trump reneged on it. Such contacts became possible when full diplomatic relations were restored in 2016. In contrast, no US diplomat has set foot in Tehran since 1981. Official Washington’s ignorance of Iran is profound – and dangerous. Part of the British pitch to Trump’s people is that they are on the ground and know Iran’s thinking.This claim, too, looks threadbare these days. When Andrew Murrison, a junior Foreign Office minister, travelled to Iran last month, he received short shrift from his hosts. They repeated their view that Britain was a mere tool in Trump’s clumsy hands – and would pay a heavy price for its self-abasement. Britain has also failed in repeated efforts to secure the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, an entirely separate but nevertheless symbolic issue.Against this backdrop of diplomatic limbo, Hunt’s high-profile resort to multilateral diplomacy in Brussels underscores the continuing, vital importance of the European alliance. It is also an admission that Britain is largely powerless on its own to influence events that threaten its security and prosperity. In this sense, the Iran crisis marks an important, even watershed moment in the Brexit saga. Hunt, like Boris Johnson, is campaigning to be prime minister on a firm pledge to drag Britain out of the EU. Yet where does he turn at a moment of extreme international stress? To indispensable Europe.The Iran crisis has become a cautionary case study in the cold realities of Britain’s prospectively diminished, post-EU place and standing in the world. What a united European approach means in practice was exemplified by the joint statement issued on Sunday evening by Britain, Germany and France calling on the US and Iran to think again and start talking. This opening represents the best and perhaps last hope of avoiding a descent into war.The hazards implicit in Britain acting without Europe are also dangerously clear. Having seized an Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar, allegedly on US orders, and begun a naval buildup in the Gulf, again at US bidding, Britain has placed itself, its armed forces and energy supply-line squarely in the gunsights of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. If Trump starts a shooting war, as he nearly did last month, Britain, without a vote or a voice, will be instantly stuck in the middle of the fight.It is by no mean certain that European states, acting in concert, can persuade the two main antagonists to back down. The joint statement called on Iran and the US “to act responsibly and to look for ways to stop the escalation of tension and resume dialogue”. That was an unmistakable rebuke to Trump. The EU continues to pursue barter arrangements aimed at circumventing US sanctions, while warning Iran to honour its commitments. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, has meanwhile proposed a time-out, meaning a freeze of the status quo.What a truly extraordinary mess the Tories have got the country into. It’s evident that on Iran, as on most other major international issues, Britain naturally inclines to the European position. It’s clear the government agrees with Darroch that Trump’s trashing of the nuclear deal was a wanton piece of “diplomatic vandalism”. Hunt’s warning about the risks of having “different parties armed with nuclear weapons” in the Middle East was a reference to Saudi Arabia, whose nuclear ambitions are being actively encouraged by Trump, as well as to Israel and Iran. Hunt’s proffered compromise on the Gibraltar tanker is another sign of British dissent from the US line.Yet such minor, cautious gestures will not by themselves alter the current dynamic, which points towards military conflict, by accident or design. Not can they obscure the gross contradiction at the heart of the Tory Brexiters’ position – the rank hypocrisy of trying, even at last knockings, to have it both ways. By continuing to insist that Britain will leave the EU, Hunt (like Johnson) irresponsibly undermines Europe’s collective clout at what he acknowledges is a critical moment – and thus significantly increases the chance of war.The ability of Europe to act effectively as a necessary counterweight to irresponsible, authoritarian and power-hungry rightwing regimes in the US, China and Russia hangs in the balance. What happens now may permanently affect the course and outcome of future crises. Yet what’s more important? One man’s leadership chances? The crazed Tory obsession with Brexit? Or acting honestly together with European friends and neighbours, for reasons of principle and common sense, to face down the global warmongers and keep the peace?• Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs

iran is profound and dangerous part of the british pitch to trump s people is that they are on the ground and know iran s thinking this claim too looks threadbare these days when andrew murrison a junior foreign office minister travelled to iran last month he received short shrift from his hosts they repeated their view that britain was a mere tool in trump s clumsy hands and would pay a heavy price for its self abasement britain has also failed in repeated efforts to secure the release of nazanin zaghari ratcliffe an entirely separate but nevertheless symbolic issue against this backdrop of diplomatic limbo hunt s high profile resort to multilateral diplomacy in brussels underscores the continuing vital importance of the european alliance it is also an admission that britain is largely powerless on its own to influence events that threaten its security and prosperity in this sense the iran crisis marks an important even watershed moment in the brexit saga hunt like boris johnson is campaigning to be prime minister on a firm pledge to drag britain out of the eu yet where does he turn at a moment of extreme international stress to indispensable europe the iran crisis has become a cautionary case study in the cold realities of britain s prospectively diminished post eu place and standing in the world what a united european approach means in practice was exemplified by the joint statement issued on sunday evening by britain germany and france calling on the us and iran to think again and start talking this opening represents the best and perhaps last hope of avoiding a descent into war the hazards implicit in britain acting without europe are also dangerously clear having seized an iranian oil tanker off gibraltar allegedly on us orders and begun a naval buildup in the gulf again at us bidding britain has placed itself its armed forces and energy supply line squarely in the gunsights of iran s revolutionary guards if trump starts a shooting war as he nearly did last month britain without a vote or a voice will be instantly stuck in the middle of the fight it is by no mean certain that european states acting in concert can persuade the two main antagonists to back down the joint statement called on iran and the us to act responsibly and to look for ways to stop the escalation of tension and resume dialogue that was an unmistakable rebuke to trump the eu continues to pursue barter arrangements aimed at circumventing us sanctions while warning iran to honour its commitments emmanuel macron france s president has meanwhile proposed a time out meaning a freeze of the status quo what a truly extraordinary mess the tories have got the country into it s evident that on iran as on most other major international issues britain naturally inclines to the european position it s clear the government agrees with darroch that trump s trashing of the nuclear deal was a wanton piece of diplomatic vandalism hunt s warning about the risks of having different parties armed with nuclear weapons in the middle east was a reference to saudi arabia whose nuclear ambitions are being actively encouraged by trump as well as to israel and iran hunt s proffered compromise on the gibraltar tanker is another sign of british dissent from the us line yet such minor cautious gestures will not by themselves alter the current dynamic which points towards military conflict by accident or design not can they obscure the gross contradiction at the heart of the tory brexiters position the rank hypocrisy of trying even at last knockings to have it both ways by continuing to insist that britain will leave the eu hunt like johnson irresponsibly undermines europe s collective clout at what he acknowledges is a critical moment and thus significantly increases the chance of war the ability of europe to act effectively as a necessary counterweight to irresponsible authoritarian and power hungry rightwing regimes in the us china and russia hangs in the balance what happens now may permanently affect the course and outcome of future crises yet what s more important one man s leadership chances the crazed tory obsession with brexit or acting honestly together with european friends and neighbours for reasons of principle and common sense to face down the global warmongers and keep the peace simon tisdall is a foreign affairs

"Tensions in the Middle East could pose an existential threat unless the Iran nuclear deal is maintained, Jeremy Hunt will tell EU foreign ministers in his starkest warning since the regional crisis escalated two months ago.Arriving in Brussels on Monday, the UK foreign secretary said the agreement “isn’t dead yet”, but warned that if Tehran acquired nuclear weapons, other countries in the region would too, leading to a “very toxic and dangerous situation”.His intervention is part of a European effort to preserve the landmark deal, which was abandoned unilaterally by the US a year ago, leading to an accelerating reciprocal withdrawal by Iran.“Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon,” Hunt said. “We think there is still some closing but small window to keep the deal alive.”He said the EU was prepared to launch “a proper joint investigation” into Iranian breaches of the deal, following Tehran’s recent announcements that it would start enriching uranium beyond agreed limits. “What we are looking for is to give Iran a way out of this so that they can get back into compliance with the nuclear deal,” he said.Under the joint comprehensive plan of action signed in 2015, Iran is only permitted to produce low-enriched uranium. This is uranium that has a concentration of 3%-4% of the isotope U-235. This isotype is a fissile material, which is capable of sustaining a nuclear fission chain reaction.At this low level of enrichment, it can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. Iran is permitted to stockpile 300kg of it, at an enrichment level capped at 3.67%.A bomb needs uranium that is up to 90% enriched. Iran’s atomic energy agency has said production of enriched uranium has been quadrupled. The more that uranium is enriched, the faster it is to enrich it further.Iran argues that it is no longer bound by the cap because of the withdrawal of the US from the agreement, and the reimposition of economic sanctions Donald Trump.Read more: Iran's uranium enrichment programme: the science explainedThe foreign secretary, who is trailing Boris Johnson in the race to become UK prime minister, downplayed a rift with the US over policy on Iran. Those differences were manifest in leaked cables of the outgoing British ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, who wrote that the US president, Donald Trump, scuppered the deal to spite his predecessor, Barack Obama, in an act of “diplomatic vandalism”.“We have different views as to how we keep the region denuclearised, but we have very open channels of communication on that,” Hunt said.Hunt has tried to de-escalate the situation by saying an Iranian-owned oil tanker seized by the British off Gibraltar 10 days ago might be released if Tehran promised the ship’s owners would abandon plans to unload its oil in Syria. The EU has imposed a ban on oil sales to Damascus.Hunt made the offer in a phone call with the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, on Saturday. But Zarif said afterwards that Iran should be entitled to sell oil to any country it wished, and claimed the UK seizure of the ship, Grace 1, was an act of piracy. Various Iranian government sources said the tanker was not bound for Syria, but Tehran is desperate for revenue from oil sales.Hunt is due to tell his European counterparts: “The Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, but if the different parties were armed with nuclear weapons, it would represent an existential threat to mankind. I will do everything in my power to prevent that from happening.”Heading to Brussels for urgent talks on how to reduce tensions with Iran.

Neither step in itself puts Iran close to securing a nuclear bomb.The EU has yet to put the two Iranian decisions into the dispute mechanism of the joint comprehensive plan of action, as the nuclear deal signed in 2015 is known, but it must be close to doing so.In a repetition of Tehran’s position, the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said in a televised speech on Sunday: “We have always believed in talks … if they lift sanctions, end the imposed economic pressure and return to the deal.”Zarif is due to visit New York this week for a meeting at the UN, even though a fortnight ago the US said it would be imposing sanctions on him personally, a threat Washington has so far not carried out. It is understood he has been granted a US visa to travel to New York.Zarif gave no hope of an early release for the British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, saying: “The arrest and trial of these individuals were based on completely legal procedures, and the British government is expected to respect the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary of the Islamic Republic of

"The UK is stepping up its military presence in the Gulf by sending a second warship to the region to protect British commercial oil tankers, the Ministry of Defence has said.The HMS Duncan, a Type 45 destroyer, will be deployed within days after it completed a course of Nato exercises in the Black Sea with the aim to be in the Gulf region by next week.The ship will work alongside the Royal Navy’s frigate HMS Montrose and US Gulf allies, but will not participate in Washington’s proposed global maritime coalition to protect shipping in the area.HMS Duncan was due to have taken over from HMS Montrose, but for a fixed period the two ships will instead work alongside one another.The news comes after Theresa May said she would begin talks with US authorities on increasing a transatlantic presence in the region following two sets of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, and an attempt by Iranian navy to push a British owned oil ship towards Iranian waters.The UK already has four mine-hunting vessels stationed in the region, and former naval commanders, including Admiral Lord West, have warned the UK only has eight frigates on patrol.West’s fears have been echoed by Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, who has renewed his call for UK spending on defence to double.Hunt said the UK was not seeking to escalate the crisis with Iran and that it was a time for cool heads. “We take maritime security very seriously. It is our primary responsibility to protect British shipping. This is a situation that is changing every hour, but we are reacting to what is happening in a clear and very measured way,” he added.The MoD said it was seeking to de-escalate the crisis, but conceded that with more than 15 British-owned tankers going through the Gulf each day it was not possible to protect all shipping.It said: “As part of our long-standing presence in the Gulf, HMS Duncan is deploying to the region to ensure we maintain a continuous maritime security presence while HMS Montrose comes off task for pre-planned maintenance and crew change over.“This will ensure that the UK alongside international partners can continue to support freedom of navigation for vessels transiting through this vital shipping lane.”Britain’s already poor relations with Iran deteriorated further last week when the UK seized an Iranian ship, Grace 1, carrying oil destined for Syria, a contract that the UK said was in breach of EU sanctions. Tehran has denied the ship was heading for Syria and threatened to seize a British oil tanker in retaliation, if Grace 1 was not released.The ship’s captain and chief officer were arrested by the Gibraltarian authorities after the vessel was searched for more than a week. On Saturday the Royal Gibraltar police said the pair and two second officers had been conditionally bailed without charge, while the investigation was continuing and the vessel remained in detention.Iran has accused the UK of piracy summoning the British ambassador to Tehran, Robert Macaire, four times in the past week. It has suggested the tanker was seized “at the behest of” the US government “in line with America’s hostile policies”.A spokesman for the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Mousavi, said: “This is a dangerous game and we advise them not get involved in this game under America’s influence.”He added: “We ask them again to release the tanker immediately, which will be in all countries’ interest.”A senior Iranian cleric, the Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi, was reported by state TV as saying: “The British will soon get a slap from the strong arms of our establishment for their daring, reckless and negligent act that will make them regret it for good.” The UK is among the European supporters of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal, from which Donald Trump withdrew the US last year, reimposing toughened sanctions on Tehran. When imposing the sanctions in May, the US ordered other countries and companies to halt imports of Iranian oil or face being excluded from the global financial system.In retaliation, Iran has decreased its commitments to the nuclear pact, in defiance of a warning by European countries.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service. Saudi Arabia subsequently blames Iran for the attack.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It's not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: 'If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!'Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom's south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US 'spy' drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker, Grace 1, the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row. Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.The US blames Iran for a series of attacks on shipping in the world’s most important oil artery since mid-May, allegations that have been denied by Tehran. The US has also dispatched extra troops to the region to counter what it described as Iranian threats.Meanwhile Mohamed ElBaradei, a former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, asked the UK not to get involved in US plans for military convoys to protect oil tankers in the Gulf.Accusing the US of behaving like a “bull in a china shop” and taking the world down a dead-end street, he said the confrontational approach of the White House was not going to solve the threat posed to the nuclear deal by the US decision to withdraw from it.The UK claims it has not yet seen the details of the US proposal for coordinated international naval convoys through the Gulf. This is despite Trump having raised the proposal at the end of last month, before the G20 summit in Japan, emphasising that he wanted to see more Asian countries contributing to the cost of escorting tankers. More than 60% of the oil that goes through the Gulf is heading for Asian markets.On 28 June, after other attacks on merchant ships, Brian Hook, the US special representative on Iran, travelled to London to meet the secretary general of the International Maritime Organization, Kitack Lim, to press the case for greater coordination. After the meeting Lim said: “[My] primary concern is that merchant vessels, peaceably going about their business, should not be subjected to unprovoked attacks.”The UK is increasingly caught in a vice, continuing to support the nuclear pact, while Iran slowly reduces its commitments under the deal in protest at Europe’s failure to do more to circumvent the impact of US sanctions on EU firms that want to trade with Iran.Iran says the central agreement of the nuclear deal was that Tehran would permit close international oversight of its nuclear facilities in return for closer economic ties with the west.The tensions between the UK and Iran over the oil tankers has added another dimension. The UK does not have sufficient naval assets in the region to protect all British-owned shipping, but it would be wary if the US were effectively in sole command of any such operation.ElBaradei said: “They [the US] are applying a waterboarding method to Iran, drowning Iran and then saying to them: ‘Let’s have a dialogue without pre-conditions.’”He said he was horrified by the US policy on Iran. “The new crazies are going out of the way to look for confrontation. This is an opportunity for the British to say that they are standing behind values and principles and not continuing to act as a proxy for the US.”The former nuclear inspector said if Iran was harassing ships, that was wrong, but he described its plans to enrich uranium beyond the limits set in the deal as “trifling, symbolic and a cry for help”.• This article was amended on 22 July 2019.

"“This is a dangerous game,” an Iranian foreign ministry official warned on Friday. He was urging the UK to release the Iranian tanker which the British navy helped authorities in Gibraltar to seize last week. But the context, as he made clear, is the intensifying struggle between Washington and Tehran, in which the main players appear overconfident they know the rules and understand the stakes, while minor players fret about outcomes they have limited power to change.Mohamed ElBaradei, who headed the UN nuclear watchdog in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, has offered one of the sharpest warnings of the potential consequences: “All that I hear basically [brings] to mind the days before the Iraq war,” he told the BBC. The Iranian regime’s record at home and in the region is a grim one. But this crisis was created by the US president’s determination to destroy an international nuclear deal – which Iran was abiding by – and throttle the economy. It cornered Tehran and empowered its hardliners, who seized on the proof that America could never be trusted.Yet while the Trump administration turns the screws, it is unclear what it wants. Donald Trump does not share John Bolton’s thirst for regime change, seeing an expensive war as unhelpful to his prospects of reelection. Last month he called off airstrikes at the eleventh hour. Even as the administration seizes on every Iranian action, it has apparently refrained, at least for now, from blacklisting the foreign minister, Javad Zarif, and cutting off the route to dialogue.Europe has been desperately trying to shore up the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA). But the awkwardness of Britain’s position became clearer when the Royal Navy reported it had seen off an Iranian attempt to intercept a Manx-flagged oil tanker in the strait of Hormuz on Wednesday. Tehran denies harassment, but the UK has put shipping on maximum alert in the Gulf and sent another warship.The obvious trigger was the seizure of the Iranian tanker. Britain says it acted at the request of Gibraltar’s authorities and on suspicion the vessel was bound for Syria in breach of EU sanctions – not in response to the US sanctions on Iran. But there is widespread suspicion that US pressure was key. Iran’s anger is magnified by frustration that Europe has failed to mitigate the impact of US hostility.The US is increasing its military presence in the region because of Tehran’s “hostile behaviour” and has imposed sanctions on the supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei; a move that Iran said closed the path to the dialogue the US purports to seek. Meanwhile Iran has breached the JCPOA by increasing its uranium enrichment over the agreed threshold, albeit modestly. This, like earlier attacks on tankers attributed to Iran (despite its denials) and the shooting down of a US drone, are essentially symbolic actions. A far more significant step would be to halt International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring and supervision.Iran believes it must up the ante if it is to gain any kind of relief from the crippling sanctions regime now imposed upon it, and though it knows the US could start a war, hopes the fear of not finishing it will continue to deter Mr Trump. The risk is that the president may be goaded into a war by those around him, particularly if things go wrong on the ground – and that Britain will be dragged in by a White House-appeasing prime minister. Meanwhile the slow slog of diplomacy continues, with European foreign ministers due to meet again on Monday. The EU says that more members, and non-member states too, are buying into the Instex barter-style system created to enable trade. But it still needs proper funding. Ministers must also throw their full weight behind the French-led mission to calm tensions and call out US actions as unequivocally as they have Iran’s. Hopes of halting the escalation may be faint, but the alternative should be unthinkable.",The Guardian view on Britain and Iran: a game for losers,2019-07-12/18:30:35, this is a dangerous game an iranian foreign ministry official warned on friday he was urging the uk to release the iranian tanker which the british navy helped authorities in gibraltar to seize last week but the context as he made clear is the intensifying struggle between washington and tehran in which the main players appear overconfident they know the rules and understand the stakes while minor players fret about outcomes they have limited power to change mohamed elbaradei who headed the un nuclear watchdog in the run up to the invasion of iraq has offered one of the sharpest warnings of the potential consequences all that i hear basically brings to mind the days before the iraq war he told the bbc the iranian regime s record at home and in the region is a grim one but this crisis was created by the us president s determination to destroy an international nuclear deal which iran was abiding by and throttle the economy it cornered tehran and empowered its hardliners who seized on the proof that america could never be trusted yet while the trump administration turns the screws it is unclear what it wants donald trump does not share john bolton s thirst for regime change seeing an expensive war as unhelpful to his prospects of reelection last month he called off airstrikes at the eleventh hour even as the administration seizes on every iranian action it has apparently refrained at least for now from blacklisting the foreign minister javad zarif and cutting off the route to dialogue europe has been desperately trying to shore up the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa but the awkwardness of britain s position became clearer when the royal navy reported it had seen off an iranian attempt to intercept a manx flagged oil tanker in the strait of hormuz on wednesday tehran denies harassment but the uk has put shipping on maximum alert in the gulf and sent another warship the obvious trigger was the seizure of the iranian tanker britain says it acted at the request of gibraltar s authorities and on suspicion the vessel was bound for syria in breach of eu sanctions not in response to the us sanctions on iran but there is widespread suspicion that us pressure was key iran s anger is magnified by frustration that europe has failed to mitigate the impact of us hostility the us is increasing its military presence in the region because of tehran s hostile behaviour and has imposed sanctions on the supreme leader ayatollah khamenei a move that iran said closed the path to the dialogue the us purports to seek meanwhile iran has breached the jcpoa by increasing its uranium enrichment over the agreed threshold albeit modestly this like earlier attacks on tankers attributed to iran despite its denials and the shooting down of a us drone are essentially symbolic actions a far more significant step would be to halt international atomic energy agency monitoring and supervision iran believes it must up the ante if it is to gain any kind of relief from the crippling sanctions regime now imposed upon it and though it knows the us could start a war hopes the fear of not finishing it will continue to deter mr trump the risk is that the president may be goaded into a war by those around him particularly if things go wrong on the ground and that britain will be dragged in by a white house appeasing prime minister meanwhile the slow slog of diplomacy continues with european foreign ministers due to meet again on monday the eu says that more members and non member states too are buying into the instex barter style system created to enable trade but it still needs proper funding ministers must also throw their full weight behind the french led mission to calm tensions and call out us actions as unequivocally as they have iran s hopes of halting the escalation may be faint but the alternative should be unthinkable ,Iran Sanctions,0.260590494
"Not for the first time, nor certainly the last, the Gulf is a veritable tinderbox. The immediate reason for the increase in tensions is the Royal Marines’ seizure of an Iranian tanker that was allegedly en route to Syria, in violation of EU sanctions. Rather than defuse the situation, the Tory leadership contender and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was quick to resort to sabre-rattling and a reassertion of British militarism on the high seas. For some Iranians this reawakens bitter memories of the UK’s infamous oil blockade in the early 1950s, culminating in the overthrow of the popular prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh. The very same prime minister who dared to nationalise the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, better known today as BP. In any case, what with seized ships in the Mediterranean and trouble in the Strait of Hormuz there is a danger of missing the wood for the trees in explaining what has brought about this crisis.The nature of Trump’s endgame is anyone’s guess. He most likely has little idea himselfUltimately, it is that Donald Trump made it a central part of his foreign policy platform to destroy the Iranian nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). It was a landmark non-proliferation agreement, and perhaps the signal foreign policy achievement of Barack Obama. The JCPOA was concluded in July 2015 after more than a decade-long impasse; an impasse that brought us to the brink of full-blown war on more than one occasion, and that involved cycles of brinkmanship that benefited no one, least of all a region still suffering the effects of imperial hubris in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and Libya.Almost from his first day in office Trump set about eroding the entire rationale for Iran’s signing up to the deal. He started by undermining civil aviation deals, which were a key sweetener of the JCPOA, as well as threatening foreign companies looking to invest in the country. At the same time he was applying various sanctions, even while the US continued to be a signatory. Since abandoning the deal in May 2018, the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” strategy, an economic war by any other name, has mercilessly targeted the Iranian energy, civil aviation, military and banking sectors – including the country’s central bank. When the Trump administration’s special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, was asked whether food and medicines would be exempt, he nonchalantly replied that the responsibility for any shortages lay with the Iranians.The nature of Trump’s endgame is anyone’s guess. He most likely has little idea himself, beyond an imagined red-carpet summit that will grab headlines and allow him to live down Obama’s success, while doing nothing to further the cause of non-proliferation or stability in the Middle East. Meanwhile, John Bolton, Trump’s notoriously belligerent national security adviser, with decades of hands-on experience in Washington’s halls of power, has never been shy about his ambition for a war with Iran and his commitment to regime change.Since 2017, instead of responding to the constant goading of the Trump administration, the Iranian government has bided its time and continued to adhere to the parameters of the JCPOA. That was while it was seeing its economy contract as a result of US pressure, including against any country that dared to continue to purchase Iranian oil, its single most important source of revenue. Experts expect to see a further contraction of 6%, if not more, in 2019. Perhaps naively Iran believed that the European parties to the JCPOA could insulate the Iranian economy from an unremitting campaign to tighten the screws. But thus far, the European powers have proven impotent, despite the best efforts of the high representative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy, Federica Mogherini. As a result, Iran has, more than a year after the US withdrew, departed from certain of its obligations while abiding by paragraph 36 of the JCPOA. (Under paragraph 36 Iran can wind down its commitments after exhausting various actions.)Rather than cravenly follow the Trump administration, or mindlessly pander to bellicose elements within the Tory party membership as Hunt and Boris Johnson have been doing, the British government must return to the spirit of the JCPOA. It must see to it that the Iranian government isn’t pushed into a corner where it sees no other option than to haphazardly react to what is in effect a war on its very viability as a state. The deal was effective not only from a non-proliferation perspective. It also signified a new chapter and demonstrated that all sides could reach an accord based on reciprocity and the acknowledgment of one another’s sovereign rights. The fate of 80 million Iranians hangs in the balance, and we owe them more than to indulge the whims of a narcissist fixated on spiting his predecessor.• Eskandar Sadeghi-Boroujerdi is author of

"A chain of events has been triggered that is increasingly exposing the UK diplomatically and militarily in the Gulf.The UK has put British shipping on maximum alert in the Gulf, just as the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is forced to admit that – due to successive defence cuts – the UK does not have the resources to defend British vessels.Simultaneously, the UK is battling diplomatically to keep the nuclear deal with Iran alive – a path the US rejects.British officials insist there is no connection between freedom of navigation and the preservation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the deal is known. But the two issues are inextricably linked.British officials weighed the implications for the nuclear deal before British marines seized Grace 1, an Iranian-owned oil tanker, off the strait of Gibraltar following a request from the US.On one side of the ledger, the UK prides itself on upholding international law, including sanctions. The cargo was in breach of EU law because it was taking oil to Syria.But on the other side of the ledger, capturing Grace 1 would have little practical impact on Syria since it can still import oil from Russia. Moreover, if the UK went ahead with the seizure, it would be locked into a long legal battle, while British shipping in the Gulf would be vulnerable to Iranian reprisals and damage.The UK did not need another row with Iran just as the talks between Tehran, and the UK, France and Germany to rescue the nuclear deal reached their most sensitive stage.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service. Saudi Arabia subsequently blames Iran for the attack.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It's not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: 'If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!'Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom's south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US 'spy' drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker, Grace 1, the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row. Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.Tehran had for weeks been gradually reducing its commitments under the deal, in a calibrated effort to force Europe to do more to challenge US policy.Lord Howell, a former Conservative cabinet minister and chairman of the Lords international relations committee, asked his government on Thursday whether it “was such a good idea to raid the Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar in the first place”. He said: “Obviously we want to stop oil getting to President Assad, although probably he can get all the oil he wants from Russia. Are we not supposed to be on the same side as the Iranians on the question of nuclear proliferation and control? Can we have a firm assurance that we did this not just at the say-so of the US?”Lady Goldie, for the government, insisted the request to intercept the ship came from the government of Gibraltar, but Foreign Office officials in the past have indicated the biggest factor in play was pressure from the US.Speaking on the BBC, Nathalie Tocci, the special adviser to the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, put the UK decision in a wider political context. “The UK is feeling its own fragility and a fear of isolation as it tries to cut off its membership from the EU. There’s a line connecting the Iran story and the UK ambassador to the US.”Either way, once Grace 1 had been seized, UK shipping in the Gulf was in Iranian crosshairs. By the weekend, the British government was privately advising British flagged vessels not to carry oil through the Gulf, leading to an abrupt about-turn of a BP tanker, British Heritage, heading to collect oil in Basra.By Tuesday night the British government was lifting the code alert to level 3, the highest possible, and on Wednesday the giant British Heritage was interrupted by Iranian ships.Curiously, media briefing about British Heritage, and the intervention by HMS Montrose, which warded off the Iranian boats by aiming its guns at them, came originally from the US, and not the Ministry of Defence.The episode has highlighted the vulnerability of British shipping. There are not that many large British oil or gas tankers in the region – 50 or so out of 800 – but they are now targets, and not all of them can be protected.At the same time the British appear to be sceptical of US plans to form a multinational maritime protection force in the Gulf. The UK is awaiting the details of the US proposals, but at a briefing on Tuesday, Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US military’s joint chiefs of staff, said he wanted to ensure freedom of navigation.The US would provide “command and control” ships, leading surveillance efforts, he said. However, the aim would be for other countries to offer boats to establish patrols nearby, and escort commercial ships carrying their flags through the area.The UK has not rejected this plan, but seems to be nervous that the US, with a different political agenda towards Iran, should direct ships, including those flagged by countries that are not seeking a showdown with Tehran.The Foreign Office takes the view that a confrontation with Iran would be counter-productive, and is interested in developing a regional alliance to de-escalate the conflict, an initiative that has also attracted the United Arab Emirates.As the drama takes place on the high seas, the EU says it is making some progress on its controversial barter-type system to trade with Iran and get around US sanctions, part of its efforts to keep the nuclear deal alive.The EU foreign policy secretary general, Helga Schmid, said on Thursday that beyond the 10 EU nations that were already part of the system, “we now have seven more member states that have announced they will either join the shareholders or use Instex”, she said, referring to the barter system.Schmid added that “from consultations I had last week, I can share with you that more, also non-EU member states, will join”.The EU still believes that the Iran deal can be saved, but the US wants it to fail.The risk is that, after failing to prise the UK away from its political support for the Iran nuclear deal, the US will gently prod its closest ally towards a naval bust-up in the Gulf that ends with the UK facing no option but to quit the deal and

"British ships operating in the Gulf have been put on the highest state of alert amid fears that UK-flagged commercial vessels are vulnerable to attack by Iranian gunboats.The British government changed the alert to level 3 on Tuesday, a day before a Royal Navy warship trained its guns on Iranian gunboats that tried to disrupt the passage of an Isle of Man-flagged vessel. Level 3 is described as equivalent to the domestic security classification of critical in which there is an imminent risk of an incident.The alert is for the 15-30 large British-owned vessels that travel through the Gulf every day. The UK said the commercial ship British Heritage was in disputed waters claimed by Iran when it was challenged by three Iranian vessels and ordered to move north. HMS Montrose then intervened, aiming its guns at the Iranian boats to ward them off.The UK, keen to de-escalate the crisis and preserve the international nuclear deal with Tehran, is reluctant to release the video of the incident, which was first reported by the US late on Wednesday night.“It seems that the Brits and the French and the Germans are coming around to the idea that the Iranians are up to no good!” President Trump tweeted on Thursday.Britain has one warship, HMS Montrose, and three minesweepers operating in the area and so lacks the capacity to escort all British-linked ships moving through the Strait of Hormuz. Defence officials said that the British deployment is kept under constant review, but it was not possible to escort every ship travelling in Gulf waters.British officials promised the Royal Navy “will be resolutely defending British maritime interests in the Gulf, but has no interest in escalating the situation”.The threat to British shipping in the Gulf follows the seizure by Royal Marine commandos of an Iranian-flagged vessel, Grace 1, off the Strait of Gibraltar last Thursday, that prompted Tehran to threaten reprisals. The tanker is suspected of breaching European Union sanctions by carrying a shipment of Iranian crude oil to Syria.The Indian captain of the ship and its chief officer were formally arrested on Thursday by Gibraltarian authorities after a week-long investigation. The ship remains detained and Iran has denounced the actions as piracy. Documents and electronic equipment was seized from the vessel, a spokesperson said.British Heritage had been due to collect oil in Basra, Iraq, but abruptly turned round on Saturday on the basis of British government advice. It was seeking to go through the crowded waters without a load when it faced an Iranian instruction to go clearly into Iranian waters.The waters in which British Heritage was accosted are claimed by Iran and by the United Arab Emirates. It is not possible for British shipping to go through the straits without entering Iranian waters.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst 'chokepoint'In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Phillip InmanSpeaking about the latest confrontation, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement: “Contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the strait of Hormuz.”HMS Montrose was “forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away,” the statement said. “We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.”Iran has rejected the claims. The foreign minister, Javad Zarif, called the British allegations “worthless” in remarks to the semi-official Fars news agency. “Apparently the British tanker has passed. What [the British] have said themselves and the claims that have been made are for creating tension and these claims have no value,” Zarif said.Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps also issued a statement denying involvement.The UK is waiting to hear detailed proposals from the US about a new international maritime security operation across the Gulf but ministers appear to be nervous about the implications of the plans, pointing to the existing 33-nation coalition on shipping.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.

Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.The US proposal is likely to include a requirement for Asian countries to do more financially to subsidise the security operation, with Washington pointing out that a huge proportion of oil travelling through the Gulf is destined for Asian markets.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, appeared to recognise the difficulty the UK faced in protecting its maritime shipping due to successive defence budget cuts. He tweeted: “Latest incident with Iranian boats in the Gulf shows exactly why we must invest more in defence. We have run down our Navy too much and this must now be urgently reversed. We need to show confidence in the world by putting our money where our mouth is!”Tehran has been accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz in an attempt at economic retaliation against the US after Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear agreement and imposed crippling sanctions on Iran.Washington and Tehran came close to direct military conflict last month, when Iran shot down a US drone and Trump ordered retaliatory airstrikes, only to call them off minutes beforehand.The UK and other European countries have been trying to save the deal, in which Tehran agreed to limits on its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from international sanctions.Russia and China, both signatories to the nuclear agreement along with the UK, France and Germany, called for restraint. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said “freedom of navigation should be ensured in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz”.",UK ships in Gulf on high alert after Royal Navy trains guns on

"Three Iranian boats tried to intercept a British oil tanker in the Gulf before being driven off by a Royal Navy warship, the UK said, in a major escalation of tensions in the vital shipping channel off Iran.The incident took place in the strait of Hormuz through which the commercial vessel British Heritage was attempting to pass on Wednesday.It is the latest in a series of recent incidents in the area which have sent tensions between Iran and the US soaring. It also comes after the UK seizure last week of an Iranian oil tanker, the Grace 1, off the coast of Gibraltar, for which Tehran has threatened retaliation.On Thursday, Gibraltar police said the captain and chief officer of the Grace 1 – both Indian nationals - had been arrested in connection to alleged breaching of EU sanctions on Syria, but neither had been charged. Documents and electronic equipment was seized from the vessel, a spokesperson said.Speaking about the latest confrontation, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement: “Contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the strait of Hormuz.”The British warship, HMS Montrose, was “forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away,” the statement said.“We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.”Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the confrontation as “a very concerning development and said the UK is “continuing to monitor the situation very, very carefully.”Iran has rejected the claims. Foreign minister Javad Zarif called the British allegations “worthless” in remarks to the semi-official Fars news agency.“Apparently the British tanker has passed. What [the British] have said themselves and the claims that have been made are for creating tension and these claims have no value,” Zarif said.Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) also issued a statement denying involvement.US defence officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, had earlier told Reuters that the incident happened at the northern entrance of the strait of Hormuz.“The Royal Navy HMS Montrose, which was also there, pointed it[s] guns at the boats and warned them over radio, at which point they dispersed,” one of the officials said.“It was harassment and an attempt to interfere with the passage,” another official said.A spokesperson for US central command, Captain Bill Urban, said: “We are aware of the reports of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp Navy’s FAC/FIAC harassment and attempts to interfere with the passage of the UK-flagged merchant vessel British Heritage today near the strait of Hormuz.“Threats to international freedom of navigation require an international solution.”CNN reported that a US surveillance aircraft recorded video of the incident. It said the HMS Montrose, which was escorting the oil tanker, trained its guns on the IRGC boats and issued a verbal warning. No shots were fired.British Heritage was believed to be near the island of Abu Musa when it was approached by the Iranian boats. The island is in disputed territorial waters between Iran and the UAE, but the UK said the HMS Montrose remained in international waters throughout the episode.On Wednesday Iranian president Hassan Rouhani warned the UK it would face unspecified consequences as a result of the UK’s seizure of the Grace 1 oil tanker bound for Syria off the coast of Gibraltar last week. The ship, believed to be in breach of EU sanctions on Syria, remains in British possession.Rouhani was quoted by the Iranian official IRNA news agency calling the seizure of the Iranian oil ship “mean and wrong”. During a cabinet meeting he warned London: “You are an initiator of insecurity and you will understand its repercussions.”The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst 'chokepoint'In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Phillip InmanLast week a former leader of the Revolutionary Guard said the Islamic Republic should consider seizing a British oil tanker in response.Mohsen Rezaei, who led the Guard during Iran’s 1980s “tanker war” in the Gulf, made the comments the day after nearly 30 Royal Marines were deployed to impound Grace 1.“If England does not release the Iranian oil tanker, the duty ... [of Iran] is to respond and seize one English oil tanker,” Rezaei said on Friday.Tehran has been accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the strait of Hormuz in an attempt at economic retaliation against the US after Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear agreement and imposed crippling sanctions on Iran.Washington and Tehran came as close as ever to direct military conflict last month, when Iran shot down a US drone and Trump ordered retaliatory air strikes, only to call them off minutes before impact.The UK and other European countries have been trying to save the deal, in which Tehran agreed to limits on its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from international sanctions.Tehran’s recent decision to ramp up uranium enrichment together with European powers’ inability to meet Iranian demands for economic assistance, however, makes it unlikely to survive.“It seems that the Brits and the French and the Germans are coming around to the idea that the Iranians are up to no good!”, president Trump tweeted on Thursday.Russia and China, both signatories to the nuclear agreement along with the UK, France and Germany, called for restraint. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said “freedom of navigation should be ensured in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.”The US is hoping to enlist its allies in a coalition to monitor the Iranian presence in the crucial waterway and off the coast of Yemen, Pentagon officials said this week.Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he discussed

"Iran has told Europe it will not reverse its decision to increase uranium enrichment beyond the limits set by the 2015 nuclear accord until it achieves its “full rights” to an economic relationship with the EU under the deal.Ali Shamkhani, a senior security official and representative of Iran’s supreme leader, made his remarks as he met a senior French diplomat sent to Tehran by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, also warned the UK it would face as yet unspecified consequences as a result of the UK’s seizure of an oil tanker bound for Syria off the coast of Gibraltar last week. The ship remains in British possession.Shamkhani’s warning suggests the three European powers – France, Germany and the UK – face an uphill struggle to keep the nuclear deal alive. Shamkhani said the Iranian strategy could not change, and claimed European countries had shown a lack of will to keep their side of the bargain.Meanwhile, Donald Trump threatened to crank up sanctions substantially and accused Iran of “secretly” enriching uranium in breach of the nuclear accord.“Iran has long been secretly ‘enriching’, in total violation of the terrible 150 Billion Dollar deal made by John Kerry and the Obama Administration,” Trump said on Twitter. “Sanctions will soon be increased, substantially!”The 2014 deal imposed the most intrusive nuclear supervision in any country, and there has been no serious suggestion from elsewhere that Iran is secretly enriching uranium.Kazem Gharib Abadi, Iran’s ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, said that all Tehran’s nuclear activities were being monitored by inspectors from the agency. “We have nothing to hide,” he said after an IAEA meeting in Vienna, which was called at the request of Washington.The two-day visit to Tehran by the French envoy, Emmanuel Bonne, was seen as probably the last attempt to broker a deal before Europe decided to put Iran’s actions into the formal dispute mechanism of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).If the dispute mechanism is unable to resolve the differences, it is likely the EU will restore sanctions against Iran that were taken off when the deal was first signed.Under the joint comprehensive plan of action signed in 2015, Iran is only permitted to produce low-enriched uranium. This is uranium that has a concentration of 3%-4% of the isotope U-235. This isotype is a fissile material, which is capable of sustaining a nuclear fission chain reaction.At this low level of enrichment, it can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. Iran is permitted to stockpile 300kg of it, at an enrichment level capped at 3.67%.A bomb needs uranium that is up to 90% enriched. Iran’s atomic energy agency has said production of enriched uranium has been quadrupled.

"Iran has enriched uranium beyond the key limit dictated in its 2015 deal with major powers, in the latest escalation of the crisis between Washington and Tehran.The move, confirmed by the UN’s nuclear watchdog, came amid hints from Iran that it could start enriching to 20% later in the year unless it secured European help in the face of crippling US sanctions.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance, said on Monday that Iran had breached the 3.67% enrichment limit, a move previously flagged by Tehran.A spokesman for the organisation said its director general, Yukiya Amano, had informed the IAEA board of governors that agency inspectors had verified on Monday that Iran was “enriching uranium above 3.67% U-235”.The agency, in a report to member states, said it had verified the enrichment level using online enrichment monitors and samples had also been taken on Monday for analysis.The confirmation that Iran is enriching beyond the agreed limits is the second major breach of the stipulations of 2015 joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) after it was confirmed last week that Iran had also exceeded the agreed size of its stockpile of uranium.The latest breach came as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced he was sending his top diplomatic adviser to Iran to try to help defuse tensions.China, another signatory to the deal, accused the US of “bullying” Tehran with economic sanctions.The latest moves come amid mounting military tensions between the US and Iran that nudged close to outright hostility before Donald Trump last month cancelled airstrikes drawn up in response to the shooting down of a US drone.That followed a series of attacks on oil tankers in May and June that the US and UK blamed on Tehran.The crisis over the nuclear deal has deepened as Washington has imposed sanctions eliminating the benefits Iran was meant to enjoy in return for agreeing to curbs on its nuclear programme, following the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the deal a year ago.The latest breach comes ahead of a specially convened meeting of the IAEA, called by the US for Wednesday to discuss the crisis. Tehran last week accused the US of being the major violator of the treaty because of its unilateral withdrawal from the deal.Semi-official news agencies in Iran had earlier reported that the country began enriching uranium on Monday to 4.5%, breaking the limit set four years ago. While the IAEA did not specify how much beyond the threshold Iran had gone, uranium enriched to 90% is considered weapons-grade, and the enrichment is far below this level.The Isna and Fars news agencies separately quoted Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, saying the decision to further enrich met the needs that Iran had now.“For now, we don’t need 20%,” Kamalvandi said in an interview with Iran’s state broadcaster. “But if we do, since we have already exceeded 3.67%, we have no limitations or obstacles to do so.”The Iranian moves had been anticipated by diplomats and analysts who argued that the country was likely to break conditions of the JCPOA as part of its pushback against the Trump administration’s policy of “maximum pressure” and to put pressure on Europe.Iran has set its own 60-day deadline for saving the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which it said would expire in September.Enriching uranium up to 20% would be significant, returning Iran’s stockpiles to the level of enrichment that existed before the JCPOA.Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, said on Monday that if European nations “do not fulfil their commitments seriously and do not do anything more than talk, Iran’s third step will be harder, more steadfast and somehow stunning”.","Iran has enriched uranium past key limit, IAEA confirms",2019-07-08/19:21:26,iran has enriched uranium beyond the key limit dictated in its  deal with major powers in the latest escalation of the crisis between washington and tehran the move confirmed by the un s nuclear watchdog came amid hints from iran that it could start enriching to  later in the year unless it secured european help in the face of crippling us sanctions the international atomic energy agency iaea the body tasked with verifying iranian compliance said on monday that iran had breached the   enrichment limit a move previously flagged by tehran a spokesman for the organisation said its director general yukiya amano had informed the iaea board of governors that agency inspectors had verified on monday that iran was enriching uranium above   u  the agency in a report to member states said it had verified the enrichment level using online enrichment monitors and samples had also been taken on monday for analysis the confirmation that iran is enriching beyond the agreed limits is the second major breach of the stipulations of  joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa after it was confirmed last week that iran had also exceeded the agreed size of its stockpile of uranium the latest breach came as the french president emmanuel macron announced he was sending his top diplomatic adviser to iran to try to help defuse tensions china another signatory to the deal accused the us of bullying tehran with economic sanctions the latest moves come amid mounting military tensions between the us and iran that nudged close to outright hostility before donald trump last month cancelled airstrikes drawn up in response to the shooting down of a us drone that followed a series of attacks on oil tankers in may and june that the us and uk blamed on tehran the crisis over the nuclear deal has deepened as washington has imposed sanctions eliminating the benefits iran was meant to enjoy in return for agreeing to curbs on its nuclear programme following the trump administration s withdrawal from the deal a year ago the latest breach comes ahead of a specially convened meeting of the iaea called by the us for wednesday to discuss the crisis tehran last week accused the us of being the major violator of the treaty because of its unilateral withdrawal from the deal semi official news agencies in iran had earlier reported that the country began enriching uranium on monday to   breaking the limit set four years ago while the iaea did not specify how much beyond the threshold iran had gone uranium enriched to  is considered weapons grade and the enrichment is far below this level the isna and fars news agencies separately quoted behrouz kamalvandi the spokesman of the atomic energy organisation of iran saying the decision to further enrich met the needs that iran had now for now we don t need  kamalvandi said in an interview with iran s state broadcaster but if we do since we have already exceeded   we have no limitations or

"In May 2018, the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was designed to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and had been agreed on after 12 years of exhaustive negotiations.The US began to impose new economic and political sanctions, targeting not just various sectors of the Iranian economy, but the state’s most influential entities and actors. The imposition of these sanctions has virtually killed off the possibility of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and will have political consequences for not just Iran and the US, but the whole region. The current situation is extremely fraught, with Iran responding to aggressive actions by increasing its level of uranium enrichment.The reemergence of hostility between Iran and the US – after a period of detente under Barack Obama – is one of the most urgent challenges to peace and security in the Middle East. And yet Trump’s belligerent policies have all but blocked conventional channels of diplomacy.For one thing, cooperation requires dialogue between the countries’ respective military establishments in the region. US Central Command (Centcom) and Iran’s revolutionary guard corps’ Quds force are both responsible for their countries’ extraterritorial operations. The IRGC’s designation as a terrorist organisation – and Iran’s reciprocation against Centcom – has ended the possibility of negotiation between these two extremely influential state entities.Next, in an unprecedentedly aggressive action, the Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Iran’s ultimate source of authority according to its constitution, namely the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Just as in the US the president has the authority to determine the general trajectory of foreign policy, the supreme leader in Iran is the one who sets the foreign policy of that country. Let’s not forget it was the supreme leader who allowed direct negotiation with the US over the nuclear issue in the first place. By sanctioning Ali Khamenei, Trump has effectively killed off any chance of diplomatic rapprochement so long as he is in office. And it is not only the political leadership of Ali Khamenei that is relevant here; he is also a religious scholar with millions of Shia Muslim followers – not just in Iran, but Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Bahrain and elsewhere.In addition, last week, the treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration was looking to levy penalties against Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, who trained in the US and is one of the most distinguished career diplomats in Iran’s recent history. Zarif has been compared to the popular prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh, who nationalised Iran’s oil industry and was deposed in 1953 in a coup organised by Britain and the US. Sanctioning Zarif is a mistake if the US ever wants to reengage with Iran, because he is in charge of the diplomatic channels that would be necessary to resolve this crisis. As Wendy Sherman, who led the US negotiating team in the talks that led to the 2015 accord, put it: “I can’t think of anything that makes less sense than sanctioning a key person who might actually be helpful if there is ever a dialogue with the US.”The Iran nuclear deal is the most comprehensive agreement in the history of non-proliferation. As part of it, Iran accepted the most intrusive transparency measures and stringent limits on a nuclear programme ever demanded of a non-proliferation treaty member. What is more, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently judged that Iran was in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the JCPOA.But where Iran has kept its end of the bargain, it has been rewarded with sanctions and additional pressure, and the benefits Iran was supposed to receive have been suddenly snatched away. The Trump administration made a decision to undermine the diplomatic legacy of Obama, but it may not have fully understood that in doing so it would also be obliterating any possibility of brokering its own diplomatic solution.Trump has consistently offered to talk to Iranian officials, but his actions have been by far the most belligerent since the 1979 revolution. Deploying these phony, rhetorical offers of talks at the same time as imposing devastating sanctions is not a strategy that will make Iran yield.Iran warned world powers in advance that if the other parties failed to meet their commitments, it would begin to reduce its obligations under the JCPOA. As a first step, over the past few days, it exceeded the 300kg limit on its uranium stockpiles. It has now also announced it will enrich uranium above the 3.67% limit specified by the deal. In addition, the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, has told his cabinet that the Arak reactor will be restored to its original design which, it was claimed, would be able to produce plutonium. It is crucial to note that this is the first time Iran has contravened the JCPOA. Ever since the Trump administration withdrew last year, Iran has been patiently waiting for the other parties involved in the nuclear agreement to honour their commitments, but the only outcome was the intensifying of pressures and sanctions. Iran cannot be expected to fully comply with the deal when others are failing to meet their obligations.Trump single-handedly undid 12 years of intensive negotiations between Iran and world powers by withdrawing from the nuclear deal. He chose the dangerous path of hostile policies and actions and has increased the likelihood of yet another disastrous conflict in the Middle East. He does appear to recognise that a military confrontation with Iran would be catastrophic in every possible way. But he should also realise the fact that Iran will never give in to bullying.If Trump genuinely wants to resolve this unnecessary, self-imposed crisis, he needs to make a swift strategic turnaround, one that would allow both countries to save face. Only then would credible diplomacy become possible once more.• Hossein Mousavian is a former member of Iran’s nuclear negotiating team.

"A former leader of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard has said the Islamic Republic should consider seizing a British oil tanker in response to the UK military detaining an Iranian vessel off the coast of Gibraltar.Mohsen Rezaei, who led the Guard during Iran’s 1980s “tanker war” in the Persian Gulf, made the comments the day after nearly 30 Royal Marines were deployed to impound the oil tanker Grace 1.“If England does not release the Iranian oil tanker, the duty ... [of Iran] is to respond and seize one English oil tanker,” Rezaei said on Friday.Britain’s Foreign Office said it would not respond to every comment about the incident that emerged from Iran, and reiterated its position that the action came at the request of Gibraltar to halt a vessel believed to be bound for Syria.Tehran has been accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the strait of Hormuz in an attempt at economic retaliation against the US after Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal and imposed sanctions on Iran.EU sanctions prevent the Syrian regime from importing oil, and Gibraltar said on Thursday that it believed the Grace 1 and its 2m barrels of Iranian oil were bound for the Banyas refinery in Syria.Since then, Gibraltar and Spain have become embroiled in a row about the seizure and its ultimate purpose, with Madrid saying the Grace 1 was intercepted because of a request from the US to the UK.Spain said on Friday it planned to lodge a formal complaint about the action, because it considers the sea around Gibraltar to be part of its territorial waters, while the British regard it as theirs.“We are studying the circumstances and looking at how this affects our sovereignty,” Josep Borell, Spain’s acting foreign minister, said.In response to the Spanish claims, Gibraltar said: “There has been no political request at any time from any government that the Gibraltar government should act or not act.”The territory’s government said it only organised the seizure with the help of the Royal Marines “as a direct result only of it having reasonable grounds to believe that the vessel was acting in breach of established EU sanctions against Syria”.Nevertheless, the seizure was hailed enthusiastically overnight by a key member of the Trump administration.John Bolton, the US national security adviser, tweeted: “Excellent news: UK has detained the supertanker Grace 1 laden with Iranian oil bound for Syria in violation of EU sanctions.“America and our allies will continue to prevent regimes in Tehran and Damascus from profiting off this illicit trade.”The Grace 1 was likely to remain impounded for several weeks, British sources indicated. Although its exact ownership is unclear, Tehran said the tanker was Iranian owned.After the seizure, the British ambassador to Tehran, Rob Macaire, was summoned to explain the action. After the meeting, an Iranian foreign ministry official told the Mehr news agency: “This is the very bullying policy of the US, about which the European countries have been always protesting.” He said the seizure was “tantamount to banditry”.Macaire had told the Iranians that he and the British government had supported the action by the Gibraltarian authorities to enforce sanctions against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and supplied the Royal Marines on that basis.The 28 members of the ship’s crew were questioned onboard by Gibraltarian authorities. They were mostly Indian nationals as well as some Ukrainians and Pakistanis, the territory’s government said. Pictures released by the UK’s ministry of defence showed marines on board the vessel.According to official reports in Spain, British authorities notified Madrid that the ship was about to be boarded by marines and the operation was closely watched by a civil guard patrol boat.But a Spanish foreign ministry spokesman added: “Spain didn’t want to interfere because the issue was compliance with European Union sanctions.”Iran has said it intends to enrich its uranium stocks this weekend to an unspecified level beyond the 3.67% allowed under the nuclear deal, in protest against the US sanctions.• This article was amended on 8 July 2019 to correct “international waters” to “territorial waters”.",Ex-military chief urges Iran to seize UK ship in Gibraltar tit-for-tat,2019-07-05/16:34:11,a former leader of iran s revolutionary guard has said the islamic republic should consider seizing a british oil tanker in response to the uk military detaining an iranian vessel off the coast of gibraltar mohsen rezaei who led the guard during iran s s tanker war in the persian gulf made the comments the day after nearly  royal marines were deployed to impound the oil tanker grace  if england does not release the iranian oil tanker the duty of iran is to respond and seize one english oil tanker rezaei said on friday britain s foreign office said it would not respond to every comment about the incident that emerged from iran and reiterated its position that the action came at the request of gibraltar to halt a vessel believed to be bound for syria tehran has been accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the strait of hormuz in an attempt at economic retaliation against the us after donald trump pulled out of the nuclear deal and imposed sanctions on iran eu sanctions prevent the syrian regime from importing oil and gibraltar said on thursday that it believed the grace  and its m barrels of iranian oil were bound for the banyas refinery in syria since then gibraltar and spain have become embroiled in a row about the seizure and its ultimate purpose with madrid saying the grace  was intercepted because of a request from the us to the uk spain said on friday it planned to lodge a formal complaint about the action because it considers the sea around gibraltar to be part of its territorial waters while the british regard it as theirs we are studying the circumstances and looking at how this affects our sovereignty josep borell spain s acting foreign minister said in response to the spanish claims gibraltar said there has been no political request at any time from any government that the gibraltar government should act or not act the territory s government said it only organised the seizure with the help of the royal marines as a direct result only of it having reasonable grounds to believe that the vessel was acting in breach of established eu sanctions against syria nevertheless the seizure was hailed enthusiastically overnight by a key member of the trump administration john bolton the us national security adviser tweeted excellent news uk has detained the supertanker grace  laden with iranian oil bound for syria in violation of eu sanctions america and our allies will continue to prevent regimes in tehran and damascus from profiting off this illicit trade the grace  was likely to remain impounded for several weeks british sources indicated although its exact ownership is unclear tehran said the tanker was iranian owned after the seizure the british ambassador to tehran rob macaire was summoned to explain the action after the meeting an iranian foreign ministry official told the mehr news agency this is the very bullying policy of the us about which the european countries have been always protesting he said the seizure was tantamount to banditry macaire had told the iranians that he and the british government had supported the action by the gibraltarian authorities to enforce sanctions against the regime of bashar al assad and supplied the royal marines on that basis the  members of the ship s crew were questioned onboard by gibraltarian authorities they were mostly indian nationals as well as some ukrainians and pakistanis the territory s government said pictures released by the uk s ministry of defence showed marines on board the vessel according to official reports in spain british authorities notified madrid that the ship was about to be boarded by marines and the operation was closely watched by a civil guard patrol boat but a spanish foreign ministry spokesman added spain didn t want to interfere because the issue was compliance with european union sanctions iran has said it intends to enrich its uranium stocks this weekend to an unspecified level beyond the   allowed under the nuclear deal in protest against the us sanctions this article was amended on  july  to correct international waters to territorial waters ,Iran Sanctions,0.235433176
"Royal Marines have helped seize an Iranian supertanker suspected of carrying oil to Syria off the coast of Gibraltar, escalating tensions between the UK and Tehran as the agreement aimed at halting Iran’s nuclear programme unravels.A detachment of nearly 30 British troops working with the Gibraltarian police intercepted the vessel, believed to be carrying 2m barrels of oil, in a dramatic manoeuvre Spain said had been conducted at the request of the US.Tehran responded by summoning Britain’s ambassador to its foreign ministry to explain what it described as an “illegal seizure”, which had been earlier described by the UK as enforcing the EU’s sanctions regime against Syria.It is understood that the ambassador, Rob Macaire, reiterated the British position during the meeting, saying: “[The UK] welcomes this firm action by the Gibraltarian authorities” to enforce sanctions against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.Marines from 42 Commando were involved in the overnight seizure, with some landing on the ship’s deck by rapidly descending down ropes suspended from a Wildcat helicopter, and the rest following up via speedboat.A grainy black and white image from a thermal camera released by the Ministry of Defence on Thursday showed the helicopter hovering over one end of the ship, intercepted heading east through Gibraltarian waters.Further colour pictures were released showing marines onboard Grace 1, whose ownership had not initially been clear, but whose origin was later confirmed by the Iranian foreign ministry.Its spokesman tweeted: “Following the illegal seizure of an Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar by British Royal Marines, the UK envoy to Tehran has been summoned to the ministry of foreign affairs.”MoD sources said British troops were at all times acting under the direction of the Gibraltar police. The marines provided the technical expertise to allow the tanker to be boarded at sea.But the British position appeared to be contradicted by Spain, whose acting foreign minister, Josep Borrell, said Gibraltar had seized Grace 1 after a request from the US to Britain to pick up the tanker laden with crude oil.The action comes at a time of heightened tensions between the US and Iran. Iran has been accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the strait of Hormuz, a policy of brinkmanship that analysts say is designed to show the US there is an economic cost to the Trump administration’s decision to pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal and impose economic sanctions.White House national security adviser John Bolton welcomed the seizure of the ship. “Excellent news: UK has detained the supertanker Grace I laden with Iranian oil bound for Syria in violation of EU sanctions,” Bolton tweeted. “America & our allies will continue to prevent regimes in Tehran & Damascus from profiting off this illicit trade,” he said.The UK Foreign Office faced a dilemma over the past few days knowing that if it seized the Iranian oil ship, as requested by the US, it risked deeply antagonising Tehran, which is desperate to increase its oil exports.Iran, according to some officials, is now exporting as little 200,000 barrels per day, and needs that to be closer to 600,000 to keep its economy afloat.But the Foreign Office reasoned that it had a legal and moral duty to impound any ship that was heading to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. It was the Iranian’s surprise decision to enter Gibraltarian waters with its communications transponders on that left the UK with the option to impound the vessel.In making its decision, the UK had to weigh the possible knock-on effect on the Iran nuclear deal, as well as reprisals against British diplomats in Tehran that work in an embassy that was trashed by Iranian protesters in this century.The UK insists it has no objections to Iran seeking to increase its oil exports, but only so long as it does not sell its products in breach of EU sanctions.Officials were not sure how Iran would react to the British military action, but the decision to summon the UK ambassador is a signal that Tehran views the episode as proof that Britain is not truly committed to helping the Iranian economy weather the effect of secondary sanctions.The 28 members of the ship’s crew were questioned onboard by Gibraltarian authorities. They were mostly Indian nationals but there were also some Ukrainians and Pakistanis, the territory’s government said.Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar’s chief minister, thanked the efforts of the “brave men and women” from the marines and the local agencies involved in the operation, and confirmed Grace 1 had been detained.“This action arose from information giving the Gibraltar government reasonable grounds to believe that the vessel, the Grace 1, was acting in breach of EU sanctions against Syria,” he said.“In fact, we have reason to believe that the Grace 1 was carrying its shipment of crude oil to the Banyas refinery in Syria.”Grace 1 was travelling east through the strait of Gibraltar. Tracking data from Lloyd’s List, a specialist shipping website, showed it had begun its voyage in Iran, travelling around Africa, before it passed through Gibraltarian territorial waters. Mapping data showed it sailed a longer route to the mouth of the Mediterranean, around the southern tip of Africa, instead of via the Suez Canal in Egypt.Panama’s Maritime Authority said on Thursday night that the ship was delisted from Panama’s international boat registry as of 29 May after it received an alert indicating that the Grace 1 had participated in or was linked to terrorism financing.

"Iran said some progress had been made at a meeting with world powers on its nuclear accord – but probably “still not enough” to keep the landmark 2015 deal alive.“It was a step forward, but it is still not enough and not meeting Iran’s expectations,” said Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, after the talks on Friday. “I don’t think the progress made today will be enough to stop our process – but the decision will be made in Tehran.”Tehran has threatened to withdraw from key commitments in the deal, probably on 7 July, a move that might force European powers to reluctantly join the US and quit the deal signed in 2015.Araghchi said: “The decision to reduce our commitments has already been made in Iran and we continue on that process unless our expectations are met.”But he also said a ministerial-level meeting would be held soon, probably giving Europe a further chance to save the deal from imminent collapse.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentSuch a collapse would probably lead the EU to join the US in imposing sanctions, which might bring a military response by Iran as it tries to find levers to force the west to loosen the vice on its economy.At the talks, the three European powers – France, Germany and the UK – tried to assuage Iranian doubts that Europe was sticking to its side of the 2015 bargain by pressing ahead with the long-planned mechanism to facilitate trade between Iran and Europe without being hit by US sanctions.The lead EU negotiator, Helga Schmid, hailed the discussions as constructive and said the first transactions had been completed through the mechanism, known as Instex.The EU was also due to supply a modest €3m (£2.7m) credit line to kickstart the mechanism as a signal of good intent.However, Araghchi said: “For Instex to be useful for Iran, Europeans need to buy oil or consider credit lines for this mechanism, otherwise Instex is not like they or us expect.”The EU has always said Instex will be confined to easing trade in humanitarian goods, such as food and medicine – a form of trading the White House says is not subject to its sanctions regime. Iran had billed the Vienna meeting as the last chance to salvage the deal.The Chinese envoy, Fu Cong, said Beijing rejected the US policy of unilateral sanctions, suggesting China may be willing to defy the US threat.But the US special representative on Iran, Brian Hook, insisted the US would put sanctions on all Iranian oil exports. “We will sanction any illicit purchases of Iranian crude oil. There are right now no oil waivers in place,” he said.Hook said the US economic grip on Iran was intended to force Tehran to renegotiate the original nuclear deal, turning it into a binding international treaty that also covers wider issues including Iran’s ballistic missile programme, its regional interference and its treatment of dual national prisoners.He also promised the US would go ahead with plans to impose sanctions on Iran’s chief diplomat, Javad Zarif. He said Iran’s goal was to bring the Middle East under the thrall of Tehran’s “Marxist theocratic” ideology.Hook was in London to urge the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a UN body, to back his plan for a UN-endorsed maritime protection force, modelled on an established UN anti-piracy force off the coast of Somalia.He said Iran, by its threats to Gulf shipping, was “courting a financial and environment disaster”, and was breaching all maritime rules by turning off its ship collision avoidance transponders in an attempt to smuggle oil out of Iran and avoid being tracked by the US.“An outlaw regime is violating basic maritime law and now represents a maritime threat across the Gulf,” Hook said after meeting the IMO secretary general, Kitack Lim.Hook went further than before by accusing Iran of planning to gain a stranglehold on all international oil-related shipping by controlling not just the Gulf of Oman, off the Iranian coast, but also the Red Sea shipping lanes through the Bab al-Mandab strait off Yemen that take oil into the Arabian Sea and on to Asia.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst 'chokepoint'In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Phillip InmanHis claim shows the extent to which the US regards defeat of the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen as integral to the wider defeat of Iran. “If we do not prevent Iranians from laying down deep roots in Yemen, they will be in a position to threaten to close the strait of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab,” Hook said. “They are seeking to do in Yemen what they succeeded to do in Lebanon. They would like to ‘Lebanonise’ Yemen and become a power broker on the Saudi southern border and to be in a position to harass the Emiratis and Saudis, and to be another threat in their threat matrix to freedom of navigation. We are pushing back on Iran’s long game in Yemen.”The sanctions, hailed by Hook as unprecedented, have so far cut Iranian oil exports to 400,000 barrels a day, levels that have put the Iranian government deep into debt.“This is a clerical regime that wants to remake the Middle East in its image – and that would deeply destabilise the Middle East to have regimes following the same Marxist theocratic regime,” Hook said.Describing the state of tension in the region, he said Iran’s goal “is to scare the global oil market to keep the price up and to keep the world on edge”.",Iran says

"Scott Morrison says Australia has not yet been asked to take part in any military action in Iran but says any request from the Trump administration will be considered “seriously and on its merits”.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has asked Australia to toughen its stance on Tehran and play a key role in a new “global coalition” against the regime.Tensions between the US and Iran are at their worst point since the White House pulled out of what the president said was an “unfair” nuclear deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action in May last year.Before the G20 summit in Osaka, Pompeo called on Australia to join what he described as a “global coalition” against Iran, which last week shot down a US surveillance drone. Iran has said the drone was in its airspace.But as the Trump administration escalates its sanctions and rhetoric, Pompeo said the US would welcome a move from Australia to impose additional economic sanctions on Iran.“I think Australia is an important player here,” he told the Australian. “I think they carry a lot of weight in the sense that they, like many nations, suffer from the fact the world’s largest state sponsor of terror continues down the path of building its missile program in a way that threatens not only the Middle East but the entire world.“Australia is an ­important economic player so the imposition of more autonomous sanctions would be welcomed as well.”With the temperature rising, Morrison was asked by the ABC on Friday whether the US had sought or discussed the prospect of Australian involvement in military action when he met Trump and senior administration officials for dinner in Japan on Thursday night.Morrison said nothing had been sought but Australia was watching developments closely. “There are no requests and at this stage I think those issues are a bit premature but we are obviously concerned,” the prime minister said.“We will obviously work closely but any request like that will be dealt with in the normal way.”Pressed on whether he would rule out Australian military support, Morrison said: “We would deal with any request from an ally such as the United States seriously and on its merits.”• Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningThe trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said on Friday morning Australia had not decided to pursue further economic sanctions but they were under consideration. “The situation is troubling,” he told ABC Radio.Birmingham said the government was continually looking at whether Australia’s current sanctions were “fit for purpose” and was examining the “additional steps” taken by the Trump administration.The US and Iran have edged closer to conflict after the downing of a Norwegian tanker and a Japanese tanker in the Gulf of Oman. The US has blamed Iran, which denies any involvement.Trump called off an airstrike against the country last week after the downing of the US drone, instead choosing to impose additional sanctions on Tehran. In a tweet, he threatened to “obliterate” the Middle Eastern country.Britain, France and other European leaders, meanwhile, have been urging Tehran to abandon its efforts to enrich uranium at levels that would breach the the Obama-era nuclear deal. While the US has removed itself from the deal, other countries, including Australia and China, still support it and opposed Trump’s decision to withdraw.The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said on Thursday Trump’s belief he could stage a “short war” with Iran were wrong.In a tweet, he said: “Sanctions aren’t alternative to war; they ARE war,” adding: “‘Obliteration’=genocide=war crime. ‘Short war’ with Iran is an illusion. Whoever begins war will not be the one ending it. Negotiations and threats are mutually exclusive.”Trump praised Morrison on Thursday for his election victory in May. Australia’s focus at the G20 summit is trade and encouraging both the US and China to desist from their current dispute.",Scott Morrison on Iran: we'll 'seriously' consider any US request to join military action,2019-06-28/00:42:45,scott morrison says australia has not yet been asked to take part in any military action in iran but says any request from the trump administration will be considered seriously and on its merits the us secretary of state mike pompeo has asked australia to toughen its stance on tehran and play a key role in a new global coalition against the regime tensions between the us and iran are at their worst point since the white house pulled out of what the president said was an unfair nuclear deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action in may last year before the g summit in osaka pompeo called on australia to join what he described as a global coalition against iran which last week shot down a us surveillance drone iran has said the drone was in its airspace but as the trump administration escalates its sanctions and rhetoric pompeo said the us would welcome a move from australia to impose additional economic sanctions on iran i think australia is an important player here he told the australian i think they carry a lot of weight in the sense that they like many nations suffer from the fact the world s largest state sponsor of terror continues down the path of building its missile program in a way that threatens not only the middle east but the entire world australia is an important economic player so the imposition of more autonomous sanctions would be welcomed as well with the temperature rising morrison was asked by the abc on friday whether the us had sought or discussed the prospect of australian involvement in military action when he met trump and senior administration officials for dinner in japan on thursday night morrison said nothing had been sought but australia was watching developments closely there are no requests and at this stage i think those issues are a bit premature but we are obviously concerned the prime minister said we will obviously work closely but any request like that will be dealt with in the normal way pressed on whether he would rule out australian military support morrison said we would deal with any request from an ally such as the united states seriously and on its merits sign up to receive the top stories from guardian australia every morningthe trade minister simon birmingham said on friday morning australia had not decided to pursue further economic sanctions but they were under consideration the situation is troubling he told abc radio birmingham said the government was continually looking at whether australia s current sanctions were fit for purpose and was examining the additional steps taken by the trump administration the us and iran have edged closer to conflict after the downing of a norwegian tanker and a japanese tanker in the gulf of oman the us has blamed iran which denies any involvement trump called off an airstrike against the country last week after the downing of the us drone instead choosing to impose additional sanctions on tehran in a tweet he threatened to obliterate the middle eastern country britain france and other european leaders meanwhile have been urging tehran to abandon its efforts to enrich uranium at levels that would breach the the obama era nuclear deal while the us has removed itself from the deal other countries including australia and china still support it and opposed trump s decision to withdraw the iranian foreign minister javad zarif said on thursday trump s belief he could stage a short war with iran were wrong in a tweet he said sanctions aren t alternative to war they are war adding obliteration genocide war crime short war with iran is an illusion whoever begins war will not be the one ending it negotiations and threats are mutually exclusive trump praised morrison on thursday for his election victory in may australia s focus at the g summit is trade and encouraging both the us and china to desist from their current dispute ,Iran Sanctions,0.226318702
"Britain and other international powers are set for crunch talks to persuade Iran to abandon its efforts to enrich uranium, after Tehran temporarily held back on its threat to breach the 2015 nuclear deal.Iran had threatened to go over the 300kg limit for low-enriched uranium stockpiles on Thursday, but experts at the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency said progress in increasing the stockpiles had been slower than expected and that the limit may not be reached until the weekend.The temporary reprieve follows pressure from European leaders, especially the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Iran is now waiting on the outcome of talks at the G20 Summit in Japan this weekend, and more critically, negotiations with EU powers plus China and Russia in Vienna on Friday.In Vienna, EU countries will set out plans to kickstart trade between Tehran and the bloc, one of Iran’s preconditions for sticking with the nuclear deal.Iran was said to be adding to its stockpiles at a rate of 1kg a day and could have sped up the process if it had wished to do so. There was only passing mention of the delay in breaching the stockpile limit in the official Iranian press.European diplomats said Iran in recent days had acknowledged that breaching the limit was unwise before Macron had attempted to persuade Donald Trump to de-escalate the situation by lifting some sanctions.The EU powers are expected to unveil a plan to set up a multimillion-euro credit line to kickstart a trading mechanism known as Instex, designed to help EU businesses trade with Iran while avoiding US Treasury sanctions.It is not known if the announcement of the relatively modest credit line will be enough to assuage Iran, which has been impatient regarding what it considers to be Europe’s failure to meet its commitments under the deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA).The EU has said it has been engaged in laborious legal work to set up Instex and that the framework is in place, but it is not yet able to identify companies that definitely wish to use the mechanism. The key is for the EU to be able to announce some transactions before the next and more important Iranian deadline to break other parts of the nuclear deal, set for 7 July.Under the joint comprehensive plan of action signed in 2015, Iran is only permitted to produce low-enriched uranium. This is uranium that has a concentration of 3%-4% of the isotope U-235. This isotype is a fissile material, which is capable of sustaining a nuclear fission chain reaction.At this low level of enrichment, it can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. Iran is permitted to stockpile 300kg of it, at an enrichment level capped at 3.67%.A bomb needs uranium that is up to 90% enriched. Iran’s atomic energy agency has said production of enriched uranium has been quadrupled. The more that uranium is enriched, the faster it is to enrich it further.Iran argues that it is no longer bound by the cap because of the withdrawal of the US from the agreement, and the reimposition of economic sanctions Donald Trump.Read more: Iran's uranium enrichment programme: the science explainedThe expected size of the credit line may disappoint Iran, but European officials say technical meetings about Instex’s progress were held last week in Tehran in a serious and good-natured atmosphere.The EU is lobbying hard to persuade Washington not to see any transactions completed under Instex as a target for US Treasury sanctions, pointing out that all the trade is in humanitarian goods, including food. Such goods are supposed to be exempt from the sanctions.The EU countries have said they cannot tolerate a “less for less” arrangement under which both Iran and the EU would reduce their commitments to the deal. The JCPOA is not a treaty or a legally enforceable document.Calls for Iran not to break from the deal despite the heavy US economic sanctions were made repeatedly by diplomats, including from Russia, at a meeting of the UN security council on Wednesday.Macron has called for “little gestures” to help defuse the crisis.“Tensions are growing and for me the first element is that there is no exit from the framework. The second thing, and I will discuss it with the president [Trump] tomorrow, is to do everything to avoid a military escalation,” he said. “I had a conversation with President [Hassan] Rouhani [of Iran] a couple of days ago and I indicated that any exit from the accord would be an error and any signals in that direction would be an error.”The US special envoy on Iran, Brian Hook, one of the leading architects of the sanctions regime throttling the Iranian economy, met European counterparts in Paris on Thursday. Hook insisted the US policy of maximum economic pressure was working. He will meet maritime officials in London on Friday to discuss stepping up security for oil tankers travelling through the Gulf after two separate attacks on vessels.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany.

" The Iranian and US presidents have traded insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.The very personal exchange was reminiscent of similar verbal clashes between the US and North Korean leaders in late 2017, and underlined the volatility of US foreign policymaking in the present standoff in the Gulf. Trump has swung between dire threats and offers of talks without preconditions, while ramping up sanctions.The worsening confrontation became significantly more personal this week when the US imposed sanctions on  Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and eight military commanders, and threatened measures against the foreign minister, Javad Zarif.On Tuesday, Rouhani responded by describing the US president as “afflicted by a mental disorder” and said the sanctions against Khamenei were “outrageous and idiotic” – especially as the 80-year-old cleric has no overseas assets and no plans to ever travel to the US.The insult was an echo of Kim Jong-un’s broadside against the US president in September 2017, when he called Trump a “mentally deranged US dotard”. The slanging match between Trump and Kim ultimately gave way to summitry and claims of mutual affection (with Trump even claiming they “fell in love”). The path to a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran, however, looks far more complicated.As it has frequently in the past, the reference to Trump’s mental faculties triggered an emotional response, and a flurry of tweets.“Iran leadership doesn’t understand the words ‘nice’ or ‘compassion,’ they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is Strength and Power, and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world, with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone,” he wrote.“The U.S. has not forgotten Iran’s use of IED’s & EFP’s (bombs), which killed 2000 Americans, and wounded many more … Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.”Trump’s estimate of US fatalities is much higher than the Pentagon estimate of 600.Iran has been adamant it will not be pressured into concessions and will not negotiate with the US under the current oil, banking and trade embargo. The Trump administration has accompanied the buildup of economic pressure with offers to talk. In recent days, Trump has said that offer is without preconditions. However, there have been mixed messages over what any talks would be about. State department officials have insisted a wide-ranging list of 12 US demands, including withdrawal from Syria and cutting support to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, would have to be met for sanctions to be lifted.Trump has repeatedly suggested that his sole concern is that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. Zarif on Tuesday restated Iran’s insistence that it would never pursue a nuclear weapon, saying Islam prevented the country from doing so.Iran has previously said it is ideologically and religiously opposed to acquiring nuclear weapons and seeks nuclear power only for civilian purposes. But in the current unpredictable climate it is possible Trump could pick up Zarif’s remarks as a signal to talk.Tehran has warned that on Thursday it will breach the limits on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium set out in the 2015 nuclear deal. Without sanctions relief, it will take a further – potentially more significant – step on 8 July of raising the level at which it enriches uranium, above the 3.67% agreed in 2015.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentWith those potential flashpoints looming, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to Rouhani by telephone on Tuesday. Macron and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, are expected to try to defuse tensions when they see Trump at the G20 summit in Osaka on Friday.Tehran said the US had spent weeks demanding that Iran match America’s diplomacy, but was now trying to immobilise its chief diplomat, by sanctioning Zarif.“Imposing useless sanctions on Iran’s supreme leader and the commander of Iran’s diplomacy is the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy,” the foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, said in a tweet on Tuesday. “Trump’s desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security.”Speaking in Israel, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, insisted the president remained open to real negotiations and “all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door”.Iran’s decision to breach the nuclear deal places the EU in a dilemma: France, Germany and the UK are desperate to keep the deal alive but cannot find a route to de-escalate the crisis between Tehran and Washington.The three European countries issued a statement on the margins of the UN security council on Monday urging Iran to stay inside the deal.They also insisted they were working hard to implement their commitments to Iran – a reference to setting up financial mechanisms to help Tehran trade with Europe without the threat of US sanctions – and condemned recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned Iran not to breach the uranium enrichment limits, saying in the Commons: “It is absolutely essential they stick to that deal in its entirety for it to preserve and for us to have a nuclear-free Middle East.”He also ruled out British involvement in military action. “The US is our closest ally. We talk to them the whole time but I cannot envisage any situation where they request, or we agree to, any moves to go to war.”Analysts said the impact of the fresh US sanctions on an already heavily sanctioned country would be limited. “The newly announced Iran sanctions are symbolic,” said Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.The ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries comes in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. The Trump administration blamed Iran for the attacks, but Tehran denied responsibility.",Trump threatens ‘obliteration’ after Iran suggests he has a ‘mental disorder’,2019-06-25/18:09:02, the iranian and us presidents have traded insults with hassan rouhani suggesting that donald trump suffered from a mental disorder and trump once more threatening iran with obliteration the very personal exchange was reminiscent of similar verbal clashes between the us and north korean leaders in late  and underlined the volatility of us foreign policymaking in the present standoff in the gulf trump has swung between dire threats and offers of talks without preconditions while ramping up sanctions the worsening confrontation became significantly more personal this week when the us imposed sanctions on iran s supreme leader ali khamenei and eight military commanders and threatened measures against the foreign minister javad zarif on tuesday rouhani responded by describing the us president as afflicted by a mental disorder and said the sanctions against khamenei were outrageous and idiotic especially as the  year old cleric has no overseas assets and no plans to ever travel to the us the insult was an echo of kim jong un s broadside against the us president in september  when he called trump a mentally deranged us dotard the slanging match between trump and kim ultimately gave way to summitry and claims of mutual affection with trump even claiming they fell in love the path to a diplomatic breakthrough with iran however looks far more complicated as it has frequently in the past the reference to trump s mental faculties triggered an emotional response and a flurry of tweets iran leadership doesn t understand the words nice or compassion they never have sadly the thing they do understand is strength and power and the usa is by far the most powerful military force in the world with   trillion dollars invested over the last two years alone he wrote the u s has not forgotten iran s use of ied s efp s bombs which killed  americans and wounded many more any attack by iran on anything american will be met with great and overwhelming force in some areas overwhelming will mean obliteration trump s estimate of us fatalities is much higher than the pentagon estimate of  iran has been adamant it will not be pressured into concessions and will not negotiate with the us under the current oil banking and trade embargo the trump administration has accompanied the buildup of economic pressure with offers to talk in recent days trump has said that offer is without preconditions however there have been mixed messages over what any talks would be about state department officials have insisted a wide ranging list of  us demands including withdrawal from syria and cutting support to hezbollah in lebanon and the houthis in yemen would have to be met for sanctions to be lifted trump has repeatedly suggested that his sole concern is that iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon zarif on tuesday restated iran s insistence that it would never pursue a nuclear weapon saying islam prevented the country from doing so iran has previously said it is ideologically and religiously opposed to

"Iran will never pursue a nuclear weapon, its foreign minister has claimed, saying Islam prevented the country from doing so.Iran has previously said it is ideologically opposed to acquiring nuclear weapons and seeks nuclear power only for civilian purposes. But in the current unpredictable climate it is possible Donald Trump could pick up Javad Zarif’s remarks as a signal to talk.The White House is pursuing a twin-track strategy of seeking talks while trying to throttle the Iranian economy through sanctions that block trade with Europe and oil sales, and freeze the assets of political and diplomatic leaders.Iran has said it will breach the uranium enrichment limits set out in the 2015 nuclear deal on Thursday, but that does not imply the country is on the path to building a nuclear weapon.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme.

Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentZarif pointed to the past use of nuclear weapons by the US and to recent comments by Trump that he had called off a military strike on Iran because it would have killed 150 people.“You were really worried about 150 people? How many people have you killed with a nuclear weapon? How many generations have you wiped out with these weapons?” Zarif said on Tuesday.“It is us who, because of our religious views, will never pursue a nuclear weapon.” The US president again threatened Iran with “obliteration” in a Twitter tirade in which he also accused the country’s leaders of killing 2,000 Americans.“The Iranian leadership doesn’t understand the words ‘nice’ or ‘compassion’, they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is strength and power, and the USA is by far the most powerful military force in the world, with $1.5tn invested over the last two years alone,” he wrote.“The US has not forgotten Iran’s use of IEDs & EFPs (bombs), which killed 2,000 Americans, and wounded many more … Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.”The angry tweets came after Iran said the US’s decision to impose sanctions on its supreme leader and other top officials was “idiotic” and had permanently closed the path to diplomacy between Tehran and Washington.Trump imposed fresh sanctions on Monday against the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and military chiefs, in an unprecedented step designed to increase pressure on Iran after Tehran’s downing of an unmanned American drone. Khamenei is Iran’s utmost authority, who has the last say on all state matters.Washington said it would also impose sanctions this week on Zarif, who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the US and other major powers and has spearheaded Iranian diplomacy since.Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, described the White House as “afflicted by a mental disability” and said the sanctions against Khamenei were “outrageous and idiotic”, especially as the 80-year-old cleric has no overseas assets and no plans to ever travel to the US.Tehran said the US had spent weeks demanding that Iran match America’s diplomacy with its own diplomacy, rather than military responses, but was now trying to immobilise its chief diplomat. “Imposing useless sanctions on Iran’s supreme leader and the commander of Iran’s diplomacy is the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy,” the foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said in a tweet on Tuesday. “Trump’s desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security.”Speaking in Israel, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, insisted the president remained open to real negotiations and “all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door”.Iran’s decision to breach the nuclear deal is a response to US sanctions and Europe’s failure to provide economic protection. It is due to be followed by more serious breaches on 7 July.This places the EU in a dilemma since France, Germany and the UK are desperate to keep the deal alive but cannot find a route to de-escalate the crisis between Tehran and Washington.The three European countries issued a statement on the margins of the UN security council on Monday urging Iran to stay inside the deal, saying: “It is in everyone’s interest to show restraint and avoid any actions that would undermine this vital pillar of the non-proliferation regime and of our collective security.”They also insisted they were working hard to implement their commitments to Iran – a reference to setting up financial mechanisms to help Tehran trade with Europe without the threat of US sanctions – and condemned recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned Iran not to breach the uranium enrichment limits, saying in the Commons: “It is absolutely essential they stick to that deal in its entirety for it to preserve and for us to have a nuclear-free Middle East.”He also ruled out British involvement in military action. “The US is our closest ally. We talk to them the whole time but I cannot envisage any situation where they request, or we agree to, any moves to go to war.”He again called for de-escalation, saying: “Neither side wants war, but it is very important for there to be ladders for people to climb down so discussions can take place.”Trump is due to raise the issue of tightening maritime security in the Gulf at a G20 summit starting on Friday in Japan. He wants Asian countries including Korea and Japan to contribute more to defence of shipping in the Gulf especially the strait of Hormuz.Analysts said the impact of the fresh US sanctions on an already heavily sanctioned country would be limited. “The newly announced Iran sanctions are symbolic,” said Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Trump said he was willing to pursue dialogue with Tehran without preconditions, but the sanctions appeared to make such talks even less likely.The Iranian ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said: “No one in clear mind can have a dialogue with somebody who is threatening you with sanctions; as long as that is still there, there is no way we can have a dialogue.”The ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries comes in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. The Trump administration blamed Iran for the attacks, but Tehran denied responsibility.Then last week a US drone was shot down by Iran, further escalating the crisis. The US president responded by ordering an attack on Iran, before pulling back and opting for stronger sanctions instead.Tensions with Iran have been mounting since Trump withdrew the US from the 2015

"Donald Trump has ordered new sanctions against Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and other officials including eight Revolutionary Guard commanders in the latest step of an escalating pressure campaign.Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, will also face fresh sanctions in a few days, US officials said. He negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the US and other major powers, and has spearheaded Iranian diplomacy since.Signing an executive order in the Oval Office, Trump called the increased sanctions “hard-hitting”, saying they would deny the supreme leader, his office and and those closely affiliated with him access to key financial resources. “These measures represent a strong and proportionate response to Iran’s increasingly provocative actions,” Trump said.“We do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country,” the US president added. “I can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon.”Standing alongside Trump, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the measures would freeze billions of dollars in Iranian assets.But analysts said their impact on an already heavily-sanctioned country would be limited“The newly announced Iran sanctions are symbolic,” said Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This is certainly true … because the newly sanctioned people and entities are already insulated from the international financial system.”Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service. Saudi Arabia subsequently blames Iran for the attack.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It's not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: 'If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!'Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom's south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US 'spy' drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker, Grace 1, the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row. Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.A treasury statement said eight senior commanders of the navy, aerospace and ground forces components of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) were also being targeted.“These commanders sit atop a bureaucracy that supervises the IRGC’s malicious regional activities, including its provocative ballistic missile program, harassment and sabotage of commercial vessels in international waters, and its destabilizing presence in Syria,” the statement said.Trump said he was willing to pursue dialogue with Tehran without preconditions, but the sanctions appear to make such talks even less likely, at least in the short term, particular if the US follows through its threat to sanction Zarif.The Iranian ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said: “No one in clear mind can have a dialogue with somebody who is threatening you with sanctions as long as that is still there is no way we can have a dialogue.”Ravanchi instead urged the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, to broker regional talks involving Iran and its neighbours.Khamenei and his family are said to control a business empire worth tens of billions of dollars.“The supreme leader’s office has enriched itself at the expense of the Iranian people,” the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said. “It sits atop a vast network of tyranny and corruption that deprives the Iranian people of the freedom and opportunity they deserve.”Tension has been mounting in the Gulf since Trump withdrew the US from a multilateral deal in which Iran accepted strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions. Those tensions have culminated in the sabotaging of tankers in the Persian Gulf, and the shooting down of a US drone on Thursday. Trump ordered airstrikes in reprisal, but then cancelled them.“I think a lot of restraint has been shown by us, and that doesn’t mean we’re going to show it in the future,” Trump said on Monday.When confirming he had aborted the attack on Iran on Friday, Trump had said he would be imposing new sanctions, but he said the measures against Khamenei and others were not specifically linked to the downing of the Global Hawk drone.“You could probably add that into this” he said, but added: “This was something that was going to happen anyway.”Earlier on Monday Brian Hook, the US special envoy on Iran, said he had been holding extensive talks with US allies in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. He believed a global coalition to protect shipping was required.“There have been too many attacks. We could have had an environmental disaster and extensive loss of life due to reckless Iranian provocations,” he said.Hook said the G20 summit this week in Japan would be a good forum for discussions. As many as 17 countries had been adversely effected by the recent tanker attacks either directly or through crew, insurance or contracts, he said, and an international force might isolate Iran diplomatically as well as make it more perilous for Tehran or its surrogates to mount further attacks.Iran has denied responsibility for the blasts.Hook, seen as one of the hawks on Iran inside the US administration, said Tehran faced a choice: “They can either start coming to the negotiating table or they can watch their economy continue to crumble.”Tensions with Iran have been mounting since Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal last year and began applying pressure on Tehran through economic sanctions.Trump tweeted that other countries, including China and Japan, should protect their own oil tankers in the Middle East. “Why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries … for zero compensation,” he wrote.Meanwhile, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, met Saudi Arabia’s king and crown prince for talks on Monday as the US sought to promote an anti-Iran alliance.“You are a dear friend,” King Salman told Pompeo, who was due to fly to the United Arab Emirates later on Monday for further discussions.Iran has said it will not enter into discussions until sanctions are lifted. The fresh round of US sanctions is however an attempt to force the Iranian leadership to hold talks with the US. A near-total ban on oil exports is already in place.A drone strike on an airport in Saudi Arabia by Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels, which left one person dead and 21 injured, will have coloured the mood among Gulf states. It follows another attack on 12 June.Hook is also to meet officials from Britain, France and Germany this week, but declined to say what pressure he will putting on those countries to follow the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran if, as Tehran has threatened, it breaches its permitted uranium enrichment stock levels on Thursday.The EU has the choice of either putting the issue in the nuclear deal dispute mechanism, or threatening its own retaliatory measures.Germany appeared cool towards US talk of building a global coalition against Iran. A foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday that Berlin had “taken note via the media” of Pompeo’s comments and added that “our top aim is and remains a de-escalation of the serious situation”.Hook claimed the EU was being subjected to nuclear blackmail by Iran, and claimed Iran had rejected the opportunity to take various diplomatic “off-ramps” in the past year.The UK, France and Germany are urging Tehran to wait for European countries to set up the much-delayed financial mechanism designed to help businesses in Europe trade with Iran, circumventing secondary US sanctions. Iran saw an increase in trade as one of the key benefits of the deal.",Donald Trump orders fresh sanctions against Iran's Ali Khamenei,2019-06-24/18:57:27,donald trump has ordered new sanctions

after the ship was photographed off the coast of syria a treasury statement said eight senior commanders of the navy aerospace and ground forces components of the islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc were also being targeted these commanders sit atop a bureaucracy that supervises the irgc s malicious regional activities including its provocative ballistic missile program harassment and sabotage of commercial vessels in international waters and its destabilizing presence in syria the statement said trump said he was willing to pursue dialogue with tehran without preconditions but the sanctions appear to make such talks even less likely at least in the short term particular if the us follows through its threat to sanction zarif the iranian ambassador to the un majid takht ravanchi

iranian people of the freedom and opportunity they deserve tension has been mounting in the gulf since trump withdrew the us from a multilateral deal in which iran accepted strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions those tensions have culminated in the sabotaging of tankers in the persian gulf and the shooting down of a us drone on thursday trump ordered airstrikes in reprisal but then cancelled them i think a lot of restraint has been shown by us and that doesn t mean we re going to show it in the future trump said on monday when confirming he had aborted the attack on iran on friday trump had said he would be imposing new sanctions but he said the measures against khamenei and others were not specifically linked to the downing of the global hawk drone you could probably add that into this he said but added this was something that was going to happen anyway earlier on monday brian hook the us special envoy on iran said he had been holding extensive talks with us allies in the wake of the gulf of oman tanker attacks when two vessels were damaged by explosions he believed a global coalition to protect shipping was required there have been too many attacks we could have had an environmental disaster and extensive loss of life due to reckless iranian provocations he said hook said the g summit this week in japan would be a good forum for discussions as many as  countries had been adversely effected by the recent tanker attacks either directly or through crew insurance or contracts he said and an international force might isolate iran diplomatically as well as make it more perilous for tehran or its surrogates to mount further attacks iran has denied responsibility for the blasts hook seen as one of the hawks on iran inside the us administration said tehran faced a choice they can either start coming to the negotiating table or they can watch their economy continue to crumble tensions with iran have been mounting since donald trump withdrew the us from the  nuclear deal last year and began applying pressure on tehran through economic sanctions trump tweeted that other countries including china and japan should protect their own oil tankers in the middle east why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries for zero compensation he wrote meanwhile the us secretary of state mike pompeo met saudi arabia s king and crown prince for talks on monday as the us sought to promote an anti iran alliance you are a dear friend king salman told pompeo who was due to fly to the united arab emirates later on monday for further discussions iran has said it will not enter into discussions until sanctions are lifted the fresh round of us sanctions is however an attempt to force the iranian leadership to hold talks with the us a near total ban on oil exports is already in place a drone strike on an airport in saudi arabia by iranian aligned houthi rebels which left one person dead and  injured will have coloured the mood among gulf states it follows another attack on  june hook is also to meet officials from britain france and germany this week but declined to say what pressure he will putting on those countries to follow the us out of the nuclear deal with iran if as tehran has threatened it breaches its permitted uranium enrichment stock levels on thursday the eu has the choice of either putting the issue in the nuclear deal dispute mechanism or threatening its own retaliatory measures germany appeared cool towards us talk of building a global coalition against iran a foreign ministry spokesman said on monday that berlin had taken note via the media of pompeo s comments and added that our top aim is and remains a de escalation of the serious situation hook claimed the eu was being subjected to nuclear blackmail by iran and claimed iran had rejected the opportunity to take various diplomatic off ramps in the past year the uk france and germany are urging tehran to wait for european countries to set up the much delayed financial mechanism designed to help businesses in europe trade with iran circumventing secondary us sanctions iran saw an increase in trade as one of the

"The Iranian foreign ministry has dismissed a fresh UK call to release Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Iranian-British dual national in jail on espionage charges, despite it being delivered personally by a Foreign Office minister.Andrew Murrison made the appeal for Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release on his first visit to Tehran, where he quickly discovered the low standing with which Britain is held in Iranian government circles.Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe would have to serve her sentence, denouncing a hunger strike by her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, outside the Iranian embassy in London as “blackmail”.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is arrested at Imam Khomeini airport as she is trying to return to Britain after a holiday visiting family with her daughter, Gabriella.Her husband, Richard Radcliffe, delivers a letter to David Cameron in 10 Downing Street, demanding the government do more for her release.She is sentenced to five years in jail. Her husband says the exact charges are still being kept a secret.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's health deteriorates after she spends several days on hunger strike in protest at her imprisonment.Iran’s supreme court upholds her conviction.Boris Johnson, then Foreign Secretary, tells a parliamentary select committee ""When we look at what [she] was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism"". Four days after his comments, Zaghari-Ratcliffe is returned to court, where his statement is cited in evidence against her. Her employers, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, deny that she has ever trained journalists, and her family maintain she was in Iran on holiday. Johnson is eventually forced to apologise for the ""distress and anguish"" his comments cause the family.Her husband reveals that Zaghari-Ratcliffe has fears for her health after lumps had been found in her breasts that required an ultrasound scan, and that she was now “on the verge of a nervous breakdown”.New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt meets with Richard Ratcliffe, and pledges ""We will do everything we can to bring her home.""She is granted a temporary three-day release from prison.Zaghari-Ratcliffe is on hunger strike again, in protest at the withdrawal of her medical care.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, takes the unusual step of granting her diplomatic protection – a move that raises her case from a consular matter to the level of a dispute between the two states.The UK upgrades its travel advice to British-Iranian dual nationals, for the first time advising against all travel to Iran.

Her husband also ends his strike outside the embassy.According to her husband, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was moved from Evin prison to the mental ward of Imam Khomeini hospital, where Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have prevented relatives from contacting her.Zaghari-Ratcliffe's five year old daughter Gabriella, who has lived with her grandparents in Tehran and regularly visited her mother in jail over the last three years, returns to London in order to start school.Araghchi said: “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s judiciary will not be influenced by such acts of blackmail, and those convicted of espionage must serve their terms.”Ratcliffe, a tireless campaigner for his wife’s release from a Tehran jail for the past three years is on the 10th day of a hunger strike in solidarity with his wife, who is protesting against her conditions in Evin prison. She was arrested in April 2016 and given a five-year sentence for espionage, a charge she denies. At times the Iranians have threatened a second set of charges.Their five-year-old daughter, Gabriella, has been deprived of her weekly visit to see her mother in jail, possibly because the Iranian authorities are angered by Richard Ratcliffe’s high-profile protest. Araghchi also criticised the UK government’s support for the US, saying: “It appears that the British government’s entanglement with the predicament of Brexit has prevented it from having a correct understanding of the global realities. Immature companionship with America’s bully-style measures will result in nothing but an increase in the Iranians’ historical aversion to the UK policies.”He also raised the UK’s outstanding £400m debt to the Iranian nation going back more than 40 years, which is related to the British government’s refusal to honour a contract for Chieftain tanks sold to the Shah of Iran in 1976, but never received. Araghchi called for an immediate settlement of the debts, stressing that the UK government’s refusal to do so was not acceptable or justified.The debt issue has been a running sore between the UK and Iran, with Iran pursuing it through the courts for years only to be met with UK resistance over whether it was legally able to pay the debt to entities that were subjected to sanctions. Boris Johnson, when he was foreign secretary, once briefed newspapers that the UK had decided to pay the Iranian debt – it then emerged he had failed to win Whitehall’s agreement.Murrison, on the first of his round of visits, was also given a lecture on Britain’s historical interference in Iran by Kamal Kharazi, a senior foreign policy adviser to the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Kharazi told the UK minister: “Britain has a very negative perception in the minds of people of Iran.”He cited the first world war when the UK entered Iran and caused a famine; the 1901 agreement of an oil monopoly in the country given to William Knox D’Arcy; the granting of a tobacco monopoly in 1891; the British-backed coup against the former Irainian prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, and the support for Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war.Kharazi said: “I explained these reasons for this perception and said that the British government must take serious steps

"Donald Trump has pledged that Iran’s “absolutely broken” economy will face “major” new sanctions on Monday, as Iran countered it would take further steps to increase its nuclear programme unless Europe does more to shield it from US pressure over the coming fortnight.The US president claimed that Iran wanted to negotiate because of the relentless economic pressure from sanctions. Tehran has so far rejected any talks while sanctions remain, and there was no sign of relief on Sunday. Despite calling off airstrikes that had been planned in reprisal to the downing of a US drone on Thursday, tensions in the Gulf remain high.On Sunday, one person was reported dead and seven wounded in a suspected drone attack on a Abha airport in southern Saudi Arabia. The Houthi movement in Yemen, which is backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the second drone attack on the Abha airport in 10 days, and also claimed to have struck the airport in Jizan, on the south-west Saudi coast.John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, warned Iran not to mistake US prudence for weakness. It was reported that the US carried out a cyber-attack on an organisation linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards suspected of being involved in tracking and attacking tanker traffic and naval deployments in the Gulf. A US official told CNN the US cyber command targeted software that was used to track tankers targeted in attacks in the Gulf of Oman on 13 June.Iranian cyber spies are also said to have extensively used social media, approaching sailors online while pretending to be young women, to mine intelligence on their ships’ movements.Bolton was judged to have lost an inter-agency dispute last week when Trump pulled back from missile strikes on three Iranian military sites. Trump said the US air force was “cocked and loaded” when he decided the estimated civilian death toll of a military action would be a disproportionate response to Iran’s downing of the unmanned drone.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service. Saudi Arabia subsequently blames Iran for the attack.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It's not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: 'If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!'Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom's south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US 'spy' drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker, Grace 1, the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row. Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.But Bolton, speaking in Jerusalem before a three-way conference between the US, Russia and Israel on the future role of Iran in Syria, insisted the US had not lost its nerve.He said no one had granted Iran “a hunting licence in the Middle East”. He echoed Trump’s warnings that the US military was “rebuilt, new and ready to go”, and said “biting” new sanctions would be imposed on Monday.“Iran’s continued pursuit of nuclear weapons, its threats to exceed the limits set in the failed Iran nuclear deal in the coming days … are not signs of a nation seeking peace,” Bolton said.However, back in Washington Trump issued one of his frequent reminders that Bolton does not have the final say in US national security matters, but is just one voice among several competing views.“John Bolton is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him he’d take on the whole world at one time, OK? But that doesn’t matter because I want both sides,” Trump told NBC News’s Meet the Press on Sunday. He pointed to the disastrous US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 – a war Bolton aggressively advocated – as a reason for caution in the Middle East.However, the president warned that any more hostile acts by Iran could draw a more forceful military response than the one planned and aborted on Thursday.“So what happened is I said, ‘I’m not going to do it. I’ll save it. If they do something else, it’ll be double’,” Trump told NBC, adding that he would continue to ramp up sanctions.“We are putting major additional sanctions on Iran on Monday,” Trump tweeted.In his NBC interview he added: “I think that they want to negotiate. I don’t think they like the position they’re in. Their economy is, is absolutely broken.”As he has done on almost every occasion he has discussed Iran, Trump offered direct talks with “no preconditions” focused on Iran’s nuclear programme.He said he told Shinzō Abe, before the Japanese prime minister visited Tehran on 12 June: “Send the following message: you can’t have nuclear weapons. And other than that, we can sit down and make a deal. But you cannot have nuclear weapons.”In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentOn further questioning he added the demand that Tehran should not have a ballistic missile programme, and suggested he wanted a tougher inspection regime.Iran has said it does not want to acquire nuclear weapons and has agreed not to do so under the non-proliferation treaty. Until now, it has stuck to the limits on its nuclear programme agreed in a 2015 multilateral deal, which Trump withdrew the US from last May and has since tried to destroy.Faced with a US-imposed oil embargo and a web of other sanctions, Iran has warned in recent months that it will cease to abide by some elements of the 2015 agreement.It is allowing stocks of low-enriched uranium to build up, and President Hassan Rouhani has warned that if Europe does not do more to shield Iran from US sanctions by a 8 July deadline, it will take the much more significant step of increasing its uranium enrichment levels, bringing it closer to weapons grade.On Sunday, the head of Tehran’s strategic council on foreign relations suggested Iran could further raise the stakes.“If Europeans don’t take measures within the 60-day deadline [announced by Iran in May], we will take new steps,” the semi-official news agency ISNA quoted Kamal Kharazi as saying.Speaking after meeting the British Middle East minister, Andrew Murrison, in Tehran, Kharazi said Europeans should provide capital for the special trading vehicle designed to enable European trade with Iran and circumvent US sanctions. Accusing Europe of failing to deliver on its promises, he said: “One should see whether Europe is making empty promises or taking practical steps in the two weeks that remain until the deadline.”European solidarity in support of the 2015 nuclear deal and resistance to the drift towards conflict may be affected by the current Conservative Party contest to replace Theresa May as the UK’s prime minister. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and one of the two contenders for the top job, said the UK could support the US in a conflict with Iran, depending on the circumstances.“We will stand by the United States as our strongest ally but of course we have to consider any requests for military support on a case-by-case basis,” Hunt said while campaigning in Scotland, according to the Daily Mail. “We want to de-escalate the situation but we are of course extremely worried.”The UK has its own points of friction with Iran. On his visit to Tehran, Murrison raised the plight of the Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is on hunger strike in a Tehran jail. She is serving a five-year sentence for espionage, a charge she denies.Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, is on a sympathy hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London. A stream of well-wishers have been to visit him, including Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson.

minister visited tehran on  june send the following message you can t have nuclear weapons and other than that we can sit down and make a deal but you cannot have nuclear weapons in july  iran and a six nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the joint comprehensive plan of action that ended a  year deadlock over tehran s nuclear programme the deal struck in vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks limited the iranian programme to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief at its core the jcpoa is a straightforward bargain iran s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord under the deal iran unplugged two thirds of its centrifuges shipped out  of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the international atomic energy agency iaea which has verified  times since the agreement and as recently as february that tehran has complied with its terms in return all nuclear related sanctions were lifted in january  reconnecting iran to global markets the six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with iran were in a group known as the p  the un security council s five permanent members china france russia the uk and the us and germany the nuclear deal is also enshrined in a un security council resolution that incorporated it into international law the  members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement on  may  us president donald trump pulled his country out of the deal iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later saeed kamali dehghan iran correspondenton further questioning he added the demand that tehran should not have a ballistic missile programme and suggested he wanted a tougher inspection regime iran has said it does not want to acquire nuclear weapons and has agreed not to do so under the non proliferation treaty until now it has stuck to the limits on its nuclear programme agreed in a  multilateral deal which trump withdrew the us from last may and has since tried to destroy faced with a us imposed oil embargo and a web of other sanctions iran has warned in recent months that it will cease to abide by some elements of the  agreement it is allowing stocks of low enriched uranium to build up and president hassan rouhani has warned that if europe does not do more to shield iran from us sanctions by a  july deadline it will take the much more significant step of increasing its uranium enrichment levels bringing it closer to weapons grade on sunday the head of tehran s strategic council on foreign relations suggested iran could further raise the stakes if europeans don t take measures within the  day deadline announced by iran in may we will take new steps the semi official news agency isna

"Donald Trump has said that if Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon, it will be prosperous and have the US president as “a best friend” – but also warned that the Islamic Republic would be “obliterated” in any war between the two countries.Trump’s remarks on Saturday morning came in the wake of his eleventh-hour decision to call off airstrikes in reprisal for the downing of a US surveillance drone. They are significant in that they differ starkly from the official line of his own administration: that Iran must fulfil a list of 12 US demands before sanctions can be lifted.“They’re not going to have a nuclear weapon,” Trump told reporters before leaving the White House for Camp David. “We’re not going to have Iran have a nuclear weapon.“When they agree to that, they’re going to have a wealthy country. They’re going to be so happy, and I’m going to be their best friend. I hope that happens.”Iran has insisted it has no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons and the International Atomic Energy Agency has said there is no recent evidence of development or experimentation with weaponisation. Iran has so far stuck to the limits on its nuclear programme agreed in a multilateral 2015 agreement.But more than a year after Trump pulled the US out of the deal and imposed severe sanctions, the government in Tehran is threatening to break some of those agreed limits.Iran has defended the shooting down of a US navy Global Hawk drone on Thursday morning, saying it had entered Iranian airspace.A senior commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards struck a defiant note on Saturday, in comments quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).Brig Gen Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards’ aerospace division, said: “This is our response to a violation of Iranian space and if the violation is repeated then our response will be repeated. It’s possible that this infringement of the Americans was carried out by a general or some operators.”Hajizadeh appeared to be mirroring Trump’s suggestion that the shooting down of the drone was the work of a rogue Iranian general.Trump said he would be holding meetings to discuss the standoff with Iran. In his remarks, he seemed to confirm for the first time an Iranian claim that there was a manned US spy plane in the air near the Global Hawk when the drone was brought down.“There was a plane with 38 people yesterday, did you see that?” Trump said. “I think that’s a big story. They had it in their sights and they didn’t shoot it down. I think they were very wise not to do that. And we appreciate that they didn’t do that. I think that was a very wise decision.”In an interview for NBC’s Meet the Press taped on Friday but due to air on Sunday, Trump said if a conflict did break out there would be “obliteration like you’ve never seen before”.“But I’m not looking to do that,” he said, making clear that potential that Iran might build nuclear weapons was his sole concern.Last May, secretary of state Mike Pompeo laid down 12 conditions for the normalisation of US-Iran relations, which included nuclear demands but also limits on missile development, withdrawal from Syria and an end to support for Houthi rebels in Yemen. Trump, who has been seeking to start a dialogue with Tehran, made no mention of non-nuclear conditions.The combination of dire threats and openness to freewheeling dialogue echoes Trump’s approach to North Korea in 2017.“Trump is notoriously mercurial but one thing he is consistent on is that he does not want to drag the US into a new war,” said Thomas Juneau, a former Canadian diplomat and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa.“His face-saving solution is to say he called off a military strike on Iran. We have avoided direct violence, but the underlying issues are still there with no off-ramp or process at this point that could lead to a de-escalation.”Trump said he was “getting praise” for having called off the reprisal strike.“Everyone was saying I’m a warmonger,” he said. “Now they’re saying I’m a dove.”He said his decision made clear he was not in thrall to the hawks he has appointed around him, including his national security adviser.“I have John Bolton, who I would definitely say is a hawk,” he said. “I have other people that are on the other side of the equation. Ultimately I make the decision. The only one that matters is me. I listen to everybody. I want people on both sides.”Trump also gave more detail on how the issue of estimated casualties from US strikes, predicted by 150 by the Pentagon, affected his decision.“They gave me a rough estimate earlier, but I wanted a more accurate estimate, the more accurate estimates were, I won’t go into the number of sites, but ... it was on average 40 to 50 people to the site,” Trump said.“I come from New York City, we have a lot of Iranians. And they’re great people. I have friends that are Iranians. They’re very smart, they’re very ambitious and tremendous high-quality people. I don’t want to kill 150 Iranians. I don’t want to kill 150 of anything or anybody, unless it’s absolutely necessary.”On Saturday, the Iranian foreign ministry summoned a United Arab Emirates envoy to complain about the UAE allowing the US drone to be launched from a US base on its territory, the Iranian Fars news agency reported.Foreign ministry spokesperson Abbas Mousavi told the semi-official Tasnim news agency: “Regardless of any decision [US officials] make, we will not allow any of Iran’s borders to be violated. Iran will firmly confront any aggression or threat by America.”A diplomat in the region said: “Iran doesn’t just feel attacked by the military threat. It’s mostly by the sanctions. Even if the US doesn’t attack, Iran will perceive the sanctions as an escalation and may feel they have to respond to those. I don’t think the US understands this.“Trump presents himself as open to negotiations, but he isn’t really. He won’t remove sanctions and rejoin the [nuclear deal] and anything he says isn’t credible because he pulled out of that agreement in the first place.”In London on Saturday, the British government said a Foreign Office minister would visit Iran on Sunday to call for “urgent de-escalation in the region”.The ministry said: “At this time of increased regional tensions and at a crucial period for the future of the nuclear deal, this visit is an opportunity for further open, frank and constructive engagement with the government of Iran.”To NBC, Trump denied a report that US planes were in the air when he aborted the attack on Thursday night Washington time.He said: “No, but they would have been pretty soon, and things would have happened to a point where you would not turn back, you could not turn back. Nothing was green lighted until the very end because things change.”There has been some scepticism about Trump’s account. The Washington Post quoted US officials as saying the president had been given casualty estimates earlier in the day and had still approved the operation, which would likely have used Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles aimed at anti-aircraft batteries and other military targets. Trump has tweeted there were three targets in all.According to the New York Times, the casualty estimate was supplied by Pentagon lawyers and passed to the president by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, bypassing hawkish national security aides. Tucker Carlson, the rightwing talk show host, reportedly told Trump a conflict with Iran would torpedo his chances of re-election.The Times also quoted Gen Jack Keane, a retired army vice-chairman close to the Trump White House, as saying the president received information that Iranian leaders were furious with the local commander who had ordered the Global Hawk to be shot down.",Trump: I'll be

"A Foreign Office minister is to visit Iran on Sunday and call for “urgent de-escalation in the region”, amid heightening tensions between Tehran and Washington after an unmanned American drone was shot down.Andrew Murrison, the MP for South West Wiltshire who covers the Middle East as part of his brief, will raise UK and international concerns about Iran’s “regional conduct and its threat to cease complying with the nuclear deal to which the UK remains fully committed” during “frank and constructive” talks with the government in Tehran.“At this time of increased regional tensions and at a crucial period for the future of the nuclear deal, this visit is an opportunity for further open, frank and constructive engagement with the government of Iran,” the Foreign Office said.Iran claimed the downed aircraft was “spying” in its airspace and had crossed a “red line”.

"Donald Trump has said the US air force was “cocked and loaded” to attack three Iranian targets on Friday morning, but he called off the strike with 10 minutes to spare after being told that the airstrike might kill as many as 150 people.Trump said in a series of morning tweets that he decided late on Thursday that the death toll was not a proportionate response to the Iranian shooting down of a US spy drone off the Iranian coast 24 hours earlier.The tweets revealed how close the world may have come to a Middle East conflagration, and raised questions over why the commander-in-chief was told so late in the planning of a military operation about the predicted loss of life involved. It would be routine for a president to be informed of the likely civilian casualties when the options are first presented.Trump tweeted: “We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, ‘How many will die?’ ‘150 people, sir’, was the answer from a General. 10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not … proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.“I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world. Sanctions are biting & more added last night. Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons, not against the USA, and not against the WORLD!”In an interview with NBC, released Friday, Trump elaborated on his decision. “I thought about it for a second and I said, you know what, they shot down an unmanned drone … and here we are sitting with a 150 dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said go ahead,” Trump said. “And I didn’t like it … I didn’t think it was proportionate.”Contrary to Trump’s claim, no new sanctions were imposed on Iran on Thursday night. The New York Times, which first reported the aborted attack, said that the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, while arguing for a limited airstrike, also sought to assure Trump that sanctions were having their desired long-term effect of weakening the Iranian state.Reuters news agency reported that Trump had sent a message via the Omani government warning Iran that an attack was imminent and calling for dialogue.“In his message, Trump said he was against any war with Iran and wanted to talk to Tehran about various issues … He gave a short period of time to get our response but Iran’s immediate response was that it is up to supreme leader [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei to decide about this issue,” Reuters quoted an unnamed Iranian official as saying.The spokesman for the national security council in Tehran denied receiving any message from Trump.Republican hardliners bitterly criticised Trump for aborting the strike. Liz Cheney, a Republican congresswoman (and daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney) told a rightwing radio talk show: “We simply can’t allow America’s adversaries to think that they can shoot down a US military drone with impunity.”Others, including former foreign policy officials, suggested the decision could provide breathing room for a rethink of policy. “If we can clarify objectives, how would strikes fit into the strategy?” asked Brett McGurk, a former special envoy for the counter-Isis campaign. “Are they more or less likely to bring Iran to the table? Are we prepared to further escalate if initial strikes lead to more provocations from Iran?”“Trump’s ordered pause should be used to ask these and other hard questions about the strategy, its aims, and the mounting risks should the policy remain unchanged. Last night is the first time Trump took Iran policy off autopilot, and that’s good,” McGurk said on Twitter.The UN called for calm as Washington asked the security council for a closed-door session to discuss the crisis on Monday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said “I have only one strong recommendation: nerves of steel,” according to UN spokeswoman in Geneva, Alessandra Vellucci.On the same day he ordered the airstrikes, Trump appeared conflicted about the wisdom of entering a conflict, telling reporters: “I said I want to get out of these endless wars. I campaigned on that: I want to get out.”US diplomats insisted Trump was known to favour talks but was also a believer in sending mixed messages to keep his adversaries guessing about his next move. UK diplomats are privately pressing the US to attempt more consistent diplomatic messaging.Some of Trump’s officials, notably the national security adviser, John Bolton, and Pompeo, are thought to favour an attack, while the voices of caution came mostly from the top levels of the military.Late on Friday, Trump announced that he intends to nominate Mark Esper, an army veteran who served in the first Iraq war, to lead the Pentagon. Trump had already named Esper, his current army secretary, to lead the defense department on an acting basis, starting Sunday. Trump has not had a permanent defense secretary for six months.One of the targets of the planned strikes was the S-125 Neva/Pechora surface-to-air missile system, Newsweek quoted a Pentagon official as saying. It reported that the US believed the system was behind the drone attack.The UK military was informed of the planned strike, and was told in the early hours that the assault was being called off. The attack could have placed UK maritime assets in the region under threat.The UK, along with France and Germany, are due to issue a demarche, or formal diplomatic position, to Tehran in the next 24 hours warning of severe consequences if it goes ahead with its plan to pull out of aspects of the Iran deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.Iran has said it will exceed the 300kg stockpile limit on 27 June and then on 7 July start to enrich uranium above 3.7 % levels, the proportion required for civilian nuclear fuel.The demarche, intended to encourage Tehran to stay inside the JCPOA, comes with the implication that the EU will join the US in imposing sanctions if the International Atomic Energy Authority finds Iran in breach. The EU has risked a diplomatic rift with Washington for a year by sticking with the deal.Ministers from the UK, the US, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also likely to issue a sharp warning to Iran not to use the civil war in Yemen, and its alliance with the Houthi rebels there, as a means of threatening the oil installations of Saudi Arabia, America’s chief ally in the Gulf. Washington insisted it would have been justified in striking the three chosen sites since the US drone was knocked down by an Iranian missile battery whilst in international airspace. Tehran sent detailed coordinates to the UN security council to claim that the craft was in Iranian airspace.Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guard’s aerospace division, also told reporters on Friday that a US spy plane with around 35 crew members was flying close to the downed navy Global Hawk drone, but that Iran chose not to target the manned aircraft. Separately, he told Iranian state TV that Iran sent messages to the operators of the giant unmanned drone several times before downing it with a missile.But, alongside the claims of self-restraint, the tension between Washington and Tehran continued. The US special envoy on Iran, Brian Hook, speaking in Riyadh, said, “Our diplomacy does not give Iran the right to respond with military force, Iran needs to meet our diplomacy with diplomacy and not military force.”Foreign ministry spokesman Seyyed Abbas Mousavi tweeted back: “Do you name the years of war and economic terrorism imposed on the Iranian people, not to mention the violation of the treaties and resolutions as diplomacy? The Iranian nation responds diplomacy with diplomacy, respect with respect and war with a harsh defence.”The crisis also started to affect civilian aircraft, as the Federal Aviation Administration barred American-registered aircraft from flying over parts of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. International airlines, meanwhile, have now rerouted flights to avoid Iranian airspace. Agencies contributed reporting",Trump says he stopped airstrike on Iran because 150 would have died,2019-06-21/14:41:04,donald trump has said the us air force was cocked and loaded to attack three iranian targets on friday morning but he called off the strike with  minutes to spare after being told that the airstrike might kill as many as  people trump said in a series of morning tweets that he decided late on thursday that the death toll was not a proportionate response to the iranian shooting down of a us spy drone off the iranian coast  hours earlier the tweets revealed how close the world may have come to a middle east conflagration and raised questions over why the commander in chief was told so late in the planning of a military operation about the predicted loss of life involved it would be routine for a president to be informed of the likely civilian casualties when the options are first presented trump tweeted we were cocked loaded to retaliate last night on  different sights when i asked how many will die  people sir was the answer from a general  minutes before the strike i stopped it not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone i am in no hurry our military is rebuilt new and ready to go by far the best in the world sanctions are biting more added last night iran can never have nuclear weapons not against the usa and not against the world in an interview with nbc released friday trump elaborated on his decision i thought about it for a second and i said you know what they shot down an unmanned drone and here we are sitting with a  dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after i said go ahead trump said and i didn t like it i didn t think it was proportionate contrary to trump s claim no new sanctions were imposed on iran on thursday night the new york times which first reported the aborted attack said that the us secretary of state mike pompeo while arguing for a limited airstrike also sought to assure trump that sanctions were having their desired long term effect of weakening the iranian state  news agency reported that trump had sent a message via the omani government warning iran that an attack was imminent and calling for dialogue in his message trump said he was against any war with iran and wanted to talk to tehran about various issues he gave a short period of time to get our response but iran s immediate response was that it is up to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei to decide about this issue  quoted an unnamed iranian official as saying the spokesman for the national security council in tehran denied receiving any message from trump republican hardliners bitterly criticised trump for aborting the strike liz cheney a republican congresswoman and daughter of former vice president dick cheney told a rightwing radio talk show we simply can t allow america s adversaries to think that they can shoot down a us military drone with impunity others including former foreign policy officials suggested the decision could provide breathing room for a rethink of policy if we can clarify objectives how would strikes fit into the strategy asked brett mcgurk a former special envoy for the counter isis campaign are they more or less likely to bring iran to the table are we prepared to further escalate if initial strikes lead to more provocations from iran trump s ordered pause should be used to ask these and other hard questions about the strategy its aims and the mounting risks should the policy remain unchanged last night is the first time trump took iran policy off autopilot and that s good mcgurk said on twitter the un called for calm as washington asked the security council for a closed door session to discuss the crisis on monday the un secretary general antónio guterres said i have only one strong recommendation nerves of steel according to un spokeswoman in geneva alessandra vellucci on the same day he ordered the airstrikes trump appeared conflicted about the wisdom of entering a conflict telling reporters i said i want to get out of these endless wars i campaigned on that i want to get out us diplomats insisted trump was known to favour talks but was also a believer in sending mixed messages to keep his adversaries guessing about his next move uk diplomats are privately pressing the us to attempt more consistent diplomatic messaging some of trump s officials notably the national security adviser john bolton and pompeo are thought to favour an attack while the voices of caution came mostly from the top levels

"Donald Trump reportedly gave initial approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for Tehran shooting down an American drone, before pulling back at the last minute.Planes were in the air and ships were in position, but no missiles had been fired when word came to stand down on Thursday night, the New York Times quoted an unnamed official as saying.US military and diplomatic officials were expecting strikes on a handful of radar and missile sites after the president’s top national security officials and congressional leaders gathered at the White House, the paper said. The military operation was called off around 7.30pm ET (12.30am BST).The UK was informed of the US plan for the attack and not told the reprisal raids were off until 3am UK time (10pm ET).It was not clear whether strikes would go ahead at a later date. The White House and Pentagon have not commented on the reports.On Friday Reuters reported that Trump had passed a message to Tehran via Oman warning an attack on Iran was imminent.“In his message, Trump said he was against any war with Iran and wanted to talk to Tehran about various issues,” an anonymous Iranian official told the news agency. “He gave a short period of time to get our response but Iran’s immediate response was that it is up to Supreme Leader [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei to decide about this issue.”A second Iranian official said: “We made it clear that the leader is against any talks, but the message will be conveyed to him to make a decision ... However, we told the Omani official that any attack against Iran will have regional and international consequences.”Oman – along with Japan, Iraq and to a lesser extent Switzerland – has acted as an intermediary for messages between Trump and the Iranian leadership.Khamenei has repeatedly said he will not talk to the US until it lifts economic sanctions, adding he does not trust Trump’s motives.The reported contact with Oman suggests that the White House might have been involved in brinkmanship with Tehran, but pulled back when Iran did not flinch.US officials said that Trump was known to want talks, but was also a believer in sending mixed messages to keep his adversaries guessing about his next move.He is surrounded by some officials – notably the national security adviser, John Bolton – who are thought to favour an attack.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.

Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said: “The president certainly listened to what we had to say.”One of the targets of the planned strikes was the S-125 Neva/Pechora surface-to-air missile system, Newsweek quoted a Pentagon official as saying. It reported that the US believed the system was behind the US drone attack, although Tehran said it had used its “3rd Khordad” air defence system, the Iranian equivalent of the Russian Buk system that downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014.The strikes were seemingly set for early in the day to minimise risk to the Iranian military or to civilians.Trump had earlier appeared keen to calm tensions following the shooting down early on Thursday of the US Global Hawk drone, saying blame might be on a “loose and stupid” Iranian officer acting without authorisation from Tehran.Many observers fear there is an absence of ways out if warfare was to break out.Trump’s allies claimed he was intent on listening to all sides of the argument, but his instinct, relayed to the UK, had been to use economic pressure to force the Iranians to the bargaining table, and not to press for regime change.“We didn’t have a man or woman in the drone. It would have made a big, big difference,” Trump said. Asked how the US would respond, he said: “You’ll find out.”The downing on Thursday of the unarmed aircraft was the latest of a series of incidents that have raised tensions in the Gulf region. Earlier, a total of six oil tankers were damaged in two separate attacks.According to a US official who spoke to the Associated Press, the strikes were recommended by the Pentagon and were among the options presented to senior administration officials.The report of the swift reversal on US retaliation came as the US Federal Aviation Administration banned all US airlines and aircraft from flying in Iranian airspace close to where the US drone was shot down due to “heightened military activities” in the region.There have been reports of an increase in Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps activity in the strait of Hormuz, increasing the chances of attacks on oil tankers operated by America or its Gulf allies if the US did mount an attack.The FAA issued an emergency order saying all flight operations over water in the Tehran flight information region of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman were prohibited until further notice because military activities and political tensions “present an inadvertent risk to US civil aviation operations and potential for miscalculation or mis-identification”.The order applies to US aircraft only but since the MH17 disaster all countries rely on airspace risk advice from the US, UK, France and Germany.On Thursday, Iran’s foreign minister and the US military offered competing graphics showing the drone’s flight path and where it was brought down.Javad Zarif said Iran had recovered parts of the drone in its waters and that it had originally taken off from the United Arab Emirates.A map issued by US Central Command suggested the drone was brought down in international waters in the strait of Hormuz.Flight tracking data showed commercial aircraft flying close to the Global Hawk drone at the time it was shot down, said OPS Group, which provides safety guidance to air operators.“The threat of a civil aircraft shootdown in southern Iran is real,” it advised operators on Thursday. “Avoiding the strait of Hormuz area is recommended – misidentification of aircraft is possible.”Here is our high-res map of the Civil Air Traffic picture at 2335Z last night, showing the risk to aircraft operators in the region. #opsgroup #flightplanning #IranUSTension #StraitofHormuz #drone #missile #iran #GulfOfOman pic.twitter.com/FfhGhdsKvrLast month, the FAA advised airlines to exercise caution in flying over Iran and nearby areas, due to heightened military activities and increased political tension.It said: “Although Iran likely has no intention to target civil aircraft, the presence of multiple long-range, advanced anti-aircraft capable weapons in a tense environment poses a possible risk of miscalculation or misidentification, especially during periods of heightened political tension and rhetoric.”On Friday Sardar Amir Ali Hajizadeh, a commander in Iran’s air force, claimed: “We could have targetted a US-35 P-8 American plane … But we did not do this because our goal was to bring the US drone down and to warn off the terrorist forces of the US regime.” There was no independent verification for his claim.",Donald Trump 'cancelled Iran strikes with planes in the air',2019-06-21/07:29:10,donald trump

without authorisation from tehran many observers fear there is an absence of ways out if warfare was to break out trump s allies claimed he was intent on listening to all sides of the argument but his

"US security officials have been summoned to the White House to discuss a response to the shooting down of a US spy drone, which Donald Trump has called a “big mistake” by Tehran.Iran said it shot down the unmanned aircraft in its airspace. The US military has said it was downed over international waters in the strait of Hormuz.A meeting of senior security officials, including the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Joseph Dunford, convened in the White House on Thursday morning to discuss how to react. As his officials were conferring, Trump tweeted: “Iran made a very big mistake!”But the US president later appeared to play down the incident, saying that the drone could have been shot down “by mistake.” “I think probably Iran made a mistake - I would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down,” he told reporters during an appearance with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He was coy about whether the U.S. would respond, saying only that “you’ll find out.”Earlier the president chaired a meeting with his national security adviser, John Bolton; the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo and the acting defence secretary, Patrick Shanahan. Bolton is reported to be planning to fly to Israel for consultations on the worsening situation.The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps news website said the drone “was shot down when it entered Iran’s airspace near the Kouhmobarak district in the south”, referring to the area of Iranian coast facing the strait of Hormuz.“The downing of the American drone was a clear message to America ... our borders are Iran’s red line and we will react strongly against any aggression ... Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran,” the Revolutionary Guard commander, Hossein Salami, said, according to Iranian media. Iran has announced its intention to take the matter to the UN security council.The US has denied the drone was anywhere near the Iranian coast and said that the use of a high-powered anti-aircraft missile was a danger to commercial airliners in the region.“This was an unprovoked attack on a U.S. surveillance asset that had not violated Iranian airspace at any time during its mission,” General Joseph Guastella, US Central Command’s top air force commander told reporters.“This attack is an attempt to disrupt our ability to monitor the area following recent threats to international shipping and the free flow of commerce,” Gen Guastella said. “The aircraft was over the Strait of Hormuz and fell into international waters.”US officials confirmed the downed aircraft was a US navy Global Hawk surveillance drone, which had been hit by an Iranian surface-to-air missile over the strait of Hormuz at 11.35pm GMT.The $130m (£102m) Global Hawk is the world’s largest surveillance drone, packed with sophisticated electronics and the size of a small commercial airliner. Iranian forces and allied militias had previously fired at and brought down US Reaper drones, but this is the biggest US target Iran has hit to date, as tensions in the region escalate.Close to the same time as the drone was shot down, Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are backed by Iran, hit a Saudi desalination plant with an apparently sophisticated missile, and there have been a string of rocket and mortar attacks on or close to US facilities in Iraq.On Wednesday the Pentagon confirmed it was sending an additional 1,000 troops to the Gulf in response to two attacks on commercial tankers on 13 June which the US has blamed on Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.Trump downplayed the tanker attacks as “very minor” but US officials have made clear to Iran that it would view an attack on its forces by Iran or proxy militias as a threshold for a military response.It is unclear how it will react to an attack on an unmanned – but very large and expensive – aircraft. Asked for comment on the agenda’s of Thursdays meeting a national security council spokesman said: “We don’t comment on internal deliberations.”Iran said the US drone was shot down by the “3rd Khordad” air defence system, which is an Iranian equivalent to the Russian Buk system that downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014. The use of such weapons in an area of crowded skies has underlined the dangers of the standoff in the Gulf spinning out of control.The secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, Ali Shamkhani, had said on Wednesday that Tehran would respond to any intrusion into its airspace or waters.Shamkhani emphasised that Iran robustly protects its aerial and maritime borders, describing its airspace as the country’s “red line”. “No matter whose plane trespasses into it, we have always given and will give a harsh response to intruders.”Speaking in London, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said: “The international community is determined to push back against Iran’s aggressive behaviour”.Saying steps were being prepared to protect shipping in the Gulf, he added: “Freedom of navigation is essential to global security and the world economy. Any attempt to close the strait of Hormuz will provoke a very strong reaction.”As US and Iranian forces face off in the Gulf, another potential flashpoint for conflict is drawing closer. Iran has set a deadline of 27 June by which it will breach limits on uranium stockpiles set out in the nuclear deal, a development likely to lead to renewed US demands that the EU states France, Germany and Britain join the US in pulling out of the deal.Iran says it is gradually suspending its adherence to the deal in response to the economic stranglehold being imposed on the country by US sanctions. It has warned it will raise the level at which it enriches uranium on 8 July, which would be a much more significant step as it would considerably shorten the amount of time Iran would need to build a warhead if it were to decide to make a nuclear weapon.A meeting of the joint commission that oversees the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is due to meet on 28 June in Vienna – bringing together Iran, the three EU states, China, as well as Russia. The EU will urge Iran not to take further steps to pull out of the deal, and may put Iran’s actions into the JCPOA’s lengthy dispute mechanism.",Donald Trump calls Iran attack on US drone a 'big

"Yemen has been troubled by civil wars for decades, but the current conflict intensified in March 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened on behalf of the internationally recognised government against Houthi rebels aligned with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.The war is widely regarded as having turned a poor country into a humanitarian catastrophe. Riyadh expected its air power, backed by regional coalition including the United Arab Emirates, could defeat the Houthi insurgency in a matter of months.Instead some reports suggest nearly 100,000 people have died. Others put the death toll much lower, but fighting this year alone has displaced 250,000 people. There are more than 30 active front lines. A total of 80% of the population – more than 24 million people – need assistance and protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive.Its roots lie in the Arab spring. Pro-democracy protesters took to the streets in a bid to force the president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to end his 33-year rule. He responded with economic concessions but refused to resign.By March 2011, tensions on the streets of the capital city, Sana’a, resulted in protesters dying at the hands of the military.Following an internationally brokered deal, there was a transfer of power in November to the vice-president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, paving the way for elections in February 2012 – in which he was the only candidate to lead a transitional government. Hadi’s attempts at constitutional and budget reforms were rejected by Houthi rebels from the north.The Houthis belong to a small branch of Shia Muslims known as Zaydis. They captured the capital, forcing Hadi to flee eventually to Riyadh. There is also a strong secessionist movement in the south. Arguably too many sides benefit financially from the status quo.The British play a dual role as diplomatic penholders on the Yemen file at the UN security council and military advisers to the Saudi coalition in Riyadh. Critics, including some Tory MPs, say this places the UK in the invidious role of broker and belligerent.UK diplomats, including some Saudi sceptics, claim it has influence over not just Saudi military strategy but also its diplomatic thinking, restraining the Saudis for instance from launching an all out assault on the port city of Hodeidah. It has always claimed the sale of arms to Saudis is justified in part because it buys influence with its security partner in the Gulf.The UN brokered an agreement in Stockholm in December to demilitarise the Red Sea city of Hodeidah, and after five months of tortuous talks a small part of the agreement has been implemented on the ground. The Houthis had promised a two-phase redeployment out of the city, and agreed that an alternative force – poorly defined in the Stockholm agreement – would take over security in the areas they vacated. But talks between the Houthis and the UAE-backed government forces stalled over the details.Faced by an impasse, the UN sanctioned a unilateral Houthi withdrawal from the three main ports on Yemen’s Red Sea coast – Hodeidah, Ras Issa and Saleef. The Yemeni government described the withdrawal as a sham, saying the Houthis had merely rebadged their fighters as coastguards. They pressed for the resignation of Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy for Yemen. Not everyone in the Yemen government agreed with this analysis and the foreign minister quit.No progress has been made on the second phase of redeployment, or the exchange of political prisoners. Griffiths is now trying to secure enough progress in Hodeidah to get off this hook and say the time is ripe for wider political talks on a transitional government to be held in Bonn.Yes. The Houthis, with a disputed degree of assistance from Iran, have stepped up their use of drone and missile strikes into bordering Saudi Arabia. In turn the UAE and Saudi claim these attacks are being orchestrated by Tehran to put pressure on Saudi, America’s chief ally, in the drive to make Iran renegotiate the nuclear deal, and end its regional interference.The Houthis claim the drone strikes are justified retaliation for the repeated Saudi airstrikes.",Yemen civil war: the conflict explained,2019-06-20/12:55:48,yemen has been troubled by civil wars for decades but the current conflict intensified in march  when a saudi led coalition intervened on behalf of the internationally recognised government against houthi rebels aligned with the former president ali abdullah saleh the war is widely regarded as having turned a poor country into a humanitarian catastrophe riyadh expected its air power backed by regional coalition including the united arab emirates could defeat the houthi insurgency in a matter of months instead some reports suggest nearly   people have died others put the death toll much lower but fighting this year alone has displaced   people there are more than  active front lines a total of  of the population more than  million people need assistance and protection including  million who rely on food aid to survive its roots lie in the arab spring pro democracy protesters took to the streets in a bid to force the president ali abdullah saleh to end his  year rule he responded with economic concessions but refused to resign by march  tensions on the streets of the capital city sana a resulted in protesters dying at the hands of the military following an internationally brokered deal there was a transfer of power in november to the vice president abd rabbu mansour hadi paving the way for elections in february  in which he was the only candidate to lead a transitional government hadi s attempts at constitutional and budget reforms were rejected by houthi rebels from the north the houthis belong to a small branch of shia muslims known as zaydis they captured the capital forcing hadi to flee eventually to riyadh there is also a strong secessionist movement in the south arguably too many sides benefit financially from the status quo the british play a dual role as diplomatic penholders on the yemen file at the un security council and military advisers to the saudi coalition in riyadh critics including some tory mps say this places the uk in the invidious role of broker and belligerent uk diplomats including some saudi sceptics claim it has influence over not just saudi military strategy but also its diplomatic thinking restraining the saudis for instance from launching an all out assault on the port city of hodeidah it has always claimed the sale of arms to saudis is justified in part because it buys influence with its security partner in the gulf the un brokered an agreement in stockholm in december to demilitarise the red sea city of hodeidah and after five months of tortuous talks a small part of the agreement has been implemented on the ground the houthis had promised a two phase redeployment out of the city and agreed that an alternative force poorly defined in the stockholm agreement would take over security in the areas they vacated but talks between the houthis and the uae backed government forces stalled over the details faced by an impasse the un sanctioned a unilateral houthi withdrawal from the three main ports on yemen s red sea coast hodeidah ras issa and saleef the yemeni government described the withdrawal as a sham saying the houthis had merely rebadged their fighters as coastguards they pressed for the resignation of martin griffiths the un special envoy for yemen not everyone in the yemen government agreed with this analysis and the foreign minister quit no progress has been made on the second phase of redeployment or the exchange of political prisoners griffiths is now trying to secure enough progress in hodeidah to get off this hook and say the time is ripe for wider political talks on a transitional government to be held in bonn yes the houthis with a disputed degree of assistance from iran have stepped up their use of drone and missile strikes into bordering saudi arabia in turn the uae and saudi claim these attacks are being orchestrated by tehran to put pressure on saudi america s chief ally in the drive to make iran renegotiate the nuclear deal and end its regional interference the houthis claim the drone strikes are justified retaliation for the repeated saudi airstrikes ,Iran Sanctions,0.198318005
"Britain, France and Germany are to mount a last-ditch effort to dissuade Iran from effectively quitting the nuclear deal, warning time was running out for negotiations and the risk of war in the region “has not been averted”.The diplomatic offensive includes a forthcoming visit by the UK’s new Middle East minister, Andrew Murrison.Iran has threatened to take fresh steps to leave the deal on 27 June by breaching enriched uranium limits set out in the 2015 agreement. Officials from the three EU states, which support the deal, will also meet with China and Russia to discuss the situation.The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, speaking in Paris alongside his German counterpart, said the two countries wanted to coordinate their efforts to stop Iran’s withdrawal from the deal.“We want to unify our efforts so there is a de-escalation process that starts,” Le Drian said. “There is still time and we hope all the actors show more calm. There is still time, but only a little time.”Heiko Maas, Germany’s foreign minister, added: “The risk of war in the Gulf has not been averted. We need to do everything so that it doesn’t come to this. That’s why we are talking to all sides. I was in Iran and we are also talking with the Americans. We need to de-escalate through dialogue. It is a time of ‘diplomacy first’ and that’s what we are committed to.”Murrison’s visit will be the first by a British minister since the UK claimed its own intelligence showed Iran was behind the recent attacks on tankers in the Gulf.In Tehran, President Hassan Rouhani said there was no chance Iran would delay the deadline to save the deal, but is waiting on evidence that the EU can keep its side of the bargain by setting up a functioning financial vehicle through which European nations can trade with Iran and avoid US sanctions. It appears as if the EU is racing against the clock to get the proposed measure up and running.If Iran did breach the uranium limits, the deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action, gives both sides time to go into a disputes mechanism before it is declared void.Rouhani made it clear he was not yet willing to sit with Donald Trump and the US to renegotiate the deal. He told his cabinet: “Sitting at the negotiating table with someone who continues exerting pressures on the Iranian nation has no meaning but surrendering; if they want negotiation and are sincere, they should pave the ground for it and that sincerity means removal of all cruel sanctions, respecting the Iranian nation and accepting the [ruling] system that has risen to power through people voting.”The comments came as a rocket hit a site near Basra in neighbouring Iraq used by foreign oil companies, including the US energy firm ExxonMobil. The missile strike wounded three people, and in response the oil company ordered further evacuations of staff out of the country. There have been three previous attacks on US-linked installations in recent days, but no claim of responsibility.The US evacuated hundreds of diplomatic staff from its Baghdad embassy last month, citing unspecified threats from Iran against US interests in Iraq. In Yemen, the Iranian-backed Houthis have continued their campaign to fire drones into Saudi Arabia, but an attack on Wednesday was intercepted in Yemeni air space.Analysts, as well as many Arab leaders not aligned to Saudi Arabia, believe Iran may be trying to demonstrate the chaos it can create in the oil industry if the US does not backpedal on economic sanctions. The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst 'chokepoint'In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Phillip InmanMeanwhile, US military officials have produced further evidence to support Washington’s claim that Iran was behind last week’s tanker attacks. The US navy displayed limpet mine fragments and a magnet it said it had removed from one of the vessels, noting the mines bore a striking resemblance to Iranian mines.Iran’s defence minister “categorically rejected” accusations that Tehran was behind the attacks, describing evidence presented by Washington as “unsubstantiated”, the country’s official news agency, IRNA, reported.Washington has released images and a grainy video it alleges shows Iranians on a patrol boat removing an unexploded limpet mine attached to one of the tankers.“Accusations levelled against Iran’s armed forces and the published film with regards to the incident [that] happened to the vessels … are unsubstantiated and we categorically reject these accusations,” the defence minister, Brig Gen Amir Hatami, was quoted by IRNA as saying.“The armed forces and the port organisation were among the first to approach the tankers after the incident for relief operations and they rescued 23 people in the first tanker,” he added.","UK, France and Germany in last-ditch effort to save Iran deal",2019-06-19/16:10:36,britain france and germany are to mount a last ditch effort to dissuade iran from effectively

"Three people have been injured after a rocket hit an Iraqi compound housing several international oil companies, including the US multinational ExxonMobil, officials have said.A short-range Katyusha rocket struck the Burjesia residential and operations headquarters west of Basra in the early hours of Wednesday, according to the Iraqi military. The wounded are all Iraqi nationals.The incident follows two separate attacks in as many days on bases that house US military personnel in Iraq and a series of attacks on oil infrastructure and tankers in the Middle East, which have raised tensions between the US and Iran.The US evacuated non-essential diplomatic staff from its Baghdad embassy last month and closed the country’s Basra consulate in September, citing unspecified threats from Iran against US interests in Iraq, where Tehran supports some Shia militias.ExxonMobil staff, previously ordered to leave after the departure of US diplomats, had begun to return to Basra when the rocket attack occurred. The company immediately began evacuating 21 foreign nationals to Dubai, a security source told Reuters.Operations, including those of Shell and the Italian company Eni, were not affected by the attack, the Iraqi military said. The price of Brent crude rose to $62.17 (£49.34) a barrel on Wednesday morning after another surge on Tuesday.Iraqis are worried their country will be caught up in any escalation of the dispute between the US and Iran, Baghdad’s two main allies. Tensions have flared after attacks on oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates last month and on two more ships in the Gulf of Oman last week. The Iranian-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen has claimed responsibility for the first attacks, while Washington has blamed Iran directly for the latter. Tehran has denied involvement.Last month, Donald Trump tightened US sanctions on Iran after restoring them last year when he pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal, and demanded all countries halt the import of Iranian oil or face sanctions themselves.Iran said it would break the uranium stockpile limit within 10 days and could also start the process of enriching the material up to 20%, closer to weapons grade, from 7 July.

"Irrespective of whether Iran is responsible for the recent attacks on Gulf shipping, the crisis now unfolding is fundamentally one manufactured out of thin air by the Trump administration. The implications go beyond the threat of a major war and consequent worldwide economic crash. Donald Trump’s reckless, incoherent Iran policy also throws into question the viability of the role of the United States as the global leader.The US achieved its hegemonic status in the world system not simply through raw strength, but also by convincing the second-tier capitalist powers that it could manage that system in their interests as well as its own. Washington could be relied on to confront and put down challenges to the capitalist order, expand and deepen its reach, and handle crises as they arose. It was through responsible management of the system in the interests of western capital and state power more broadly (if not of humanity as a whole) that the US secured consent from its allies to lead this new form of empire.The 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, brokered by the Obama administration and signed by the permanent five members of the UN Security Council, Germany and the European Union, was an example of this hegemony in action. The deal was only superficially about the always implausible threat that Iran would build a nuclear weapon and then use it in a suicidal attack on a US ally. The deeper strategic purpose was to bring Iran in from the cold, stabilise its relationship with the wider Middle East, and open it up as a market to international (principally European) capital. The promise of greater stability on their doorstep and a significant new global south market to exploit was a major prize for the European powers, delivered to them by a competent and responsible hegemon.So, naturally, the Europeans have watched in horror as the Trump administration tore up the deal, ratcheted up sanctions on Iran with the apparent aim of collapsing its economy, and boosted Washington’s military posturing in the Gulf on the flimsiest of pretexts. A single purpose to this aggression is difficult to discern. Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton – a hawk so thuggish he makes Donald Rumsfeld look like Bertrand Russell – is openly in favour of regime change and comfortable with starting a war to that end. Trump – counterintuitively, and in strictly relative terms – is the dove in this equation, conscious of his election promise to end foreign wars, and seeking only to force Tehran into striking a better deal than his tormentor Barack Obama was able to make. Neither of them is likely to get what they want.Trump seems to have no idea how to climb down from the perilous situation he has createdTrump and Bolton have only succeeded in provoking increased belligerence on Tehran’s behalf. Having seen its 2015 concessions rewarded with further punishment, and waited a year while Europe failed to mitigate the effects of US sanctions, the regime has now run out of patience. Its threats to finally pull out of the nuclear deal, and probable (though not certain) culpability for attacks on shipping in the Gulf, are likely designed to strengthen its hand in the stand-off, and based on the calculation that Trump does not want a war. There is a serious danger of this state of high tension breaking out into open conflict, through miscalculation or overreaction from either side. Trump seems to have no idea how to climb down from the perilous situation he has created.Washington’s European allies are now faced with the opposite of what they thought they had won in 2015. Their exporters’ and investors’ hopes of an Iranian opening are dashed, and the Middle East is more unstable than at any time since 2003. A war in the Gulf would be a disaster far worse than that triggered in Iraq 16 years ago, with an effect on the oil price that would send a weakening global economy into a nosedive. Even if Trump is replaced with a Democrat in 2021, the Iranian regime will never trust the Americans enough to strike another bargain, which leaves the hardliners in Tehran strengthened, the moderates humiliated, and regional tensions more intractable as a result. European leaders might ask themselves what Washington would do differently if it were actively seeking to betray their trust and undermine their interests.The temptation will be to wait for Trump to lose the 2020 election and for life to return to normal. But what if this is the new normal? The precedent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the militaristic dogmatism of which that enterprise was born, suggests an emerging behavioural pattern. Far from being aberrational, Trump’s presidency fits with the Republican party’s long-term trajectory into unreasoning hawkish belligerence. The fact that tens of millions of Americans – mostly middle-class or affluent white people – were prepared to vote for a figure like Trump in 2016 demonstrates that this state of affairs cannot simply be wished away. With one of Washington’s two parties of government firmly in the grip of extremists, US allies will need to ask themselves if American leadership is now a reliable asset or a dangerous liability.•

"The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has called on other nations to help safeguard tanker traffic in the Persian Gulf following a spate of attacks on ships which Washington blames on Iran.On a visit to US Central Command headquarters, Pompeo said shipping security in the Gulf was not exclusively a US problem.“You have China that depends enormously on energy transiting the Strait of Hormuz. You have South Korea, Indonesia, Japan, all of whom have an enormous interest in ensuring there’s freedom of navigation throughout this waterway,” the secretary of state said.“The United States is prepared to do its part, but every nation that has a deep interest in protecting that shipping lane so that energy can move around the world and support their economies needs to make sure they understand the real threat.”Pompeo added that “President Trump does not want war, and we will continue to communicate that message, while doing the things that are necessary to protect American interests in the region.”In an interview on Tuesday, Trump played down the threat to the US represented by the tanker attacks in the region, which he described as being “very minor”.“Other places get such vast amounts of oil there,” Trump told Time magazine. “We get very little. We have made tremendous progress in the last two and a half years in energy. And when the pipelines get built, we’re now an exporter of energy. So we’re not in the position that we used to be in in the Middle East where … some people would say we were there for the oil.”The Trump administration is seeking to handle the Gulf crisis amid turmoil in its top ranks. The acting defence secretary, Patrick Shanahan, who Trump had nominated to take on the job official, resigned on Tuesday “to devote more time to his family”, according to a Trump tweet.Trump named the army secretary, Mark Esper, to take over as acting defence secretary. The US has not had a Senate-confirmed defence secretary in place since December, when James Mattis resigned.As with his approach to Nato and US Pacific alliances, Trump is focused on persuading allies in the Gulf to shoulder a greater burden in providing security.The US would be able to rely on Gulf Arab support for tanker protection, but enlisting European involvement is complicated by the fact that European governments see the Trump administration as having precipitating the crisis by walking out of the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal with Iran, and imposing an oil and banking embargo on the country.On Tuesday, Pompeo confirmed that the visit to Tehran last week by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was made on Trump’s request.“President Trump had sent … Abe to take a message of his to the leadership in Iran,” the secretary of statem said. Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, rejected the proposal of a dialogue with Trump and the two tankers, one of them Japanese-owned, were attacked while Abe was in Tehran.The deputy chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Paul Selva also confirmed on Tuesday that the US had been using Swiss and Iraqi channels as well as public messaging to warn Iran off any direct attack on US interests.“To engage [the US reinforcements] would be a miscalculation that would lead to a response,” he said. “We don’t want them to do that. We want them to be clear-eyed in whatever it is they are planning.”He added: “The risks of miscalculation are real.”Iran has denied responsibility for the blasts that hobbled two tankers in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday, but on Tuesday the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) – which the US says carried out the attack with limpet mines – stepped up the threat to ships travelling through the Strait of Hormuz.“These missiles can hit with great precision carriers in the sea,” Brig Gen Hossein Salami said in a televised speech. “These missiles are domestically produced and are difficult to intercept and hit with other missiles.”Anthony Cordesman, a national security analyst at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said Arab states in the Gulf could easily help protect tankers with surveillance planes and drones, and could have warplanes at the site of an attack within minutes.Cordesman acknowledged that deep scepticism over US policy towards Iran has made European governments cautious about being drawn into a conflict, but he argued that the presence of a UK and French naval fleet could offer a powerful political deterrent to further attacks.“If what you want is a precondition for negotiations, and cool the situation down, there is an incentive for the UK and France to take part – if what you are doing is deterring attacks and monitoring the situation,” Cordesman said. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state for political affairs, said: “The administration has a credibility problem due to its rash and unwise disavowal of the Iran nuclear deal and its threats to sanction European companies that do business with Iran.”He added: “But Iran is clearly in the wrong in its activities in the Gulf. The administration is right to consider international convoys. And it is in the clear interest of the European allies, as well as some of the Sunni Arab states, to help the US. At risk is commercial energy traffic in a critical international waterway. Europe, especially, should want to see the free flow of oil and gas for its economic wellbeing.”",Mike Pompeo urges other countries to help protect tankers after Gulf attacks,2019-06-18/20:45:44,the

"In Washington, at times of stress, international crises play out in black and white. As in a flickering newsreel from a former age, complex events are reduced to symbolic emblems of right and wrong. Grainy video images of “evil-doers”, George W Bush’s favoured term, purport to show faceless Iranians acting suspiciously around a burning oil tanker in the Gulf last week. As new Middle East troop deployments are announced, US battleships are pictured bravely patrolling freedom’s frontline.Monochromatic simplifications of this type suit multiple purposes. In the present US-Iran crisis, they supposedly provide official “proof” of nefarious intent. They can be seen to justify escalatory US actions that might previously have appeared unreasonable and provocative. They place pressure on reluctant allies to fall in behind the advancing American columns. Most of all, since democratic consent apparently still counts for something, they are intended to rally public support.We have seen this badly made movie before. And today, as in 2003, it presents a shadowy, unconvincing picture that no amount of White House manipulation and rhetoric can clarify. The fact is, the current crisis was conceived, manufactured and magnified in Washington. It has been whipped up by a group of hawkish policymakers around Donald Trump whose loathing for the Tehran regime is exceeded only by their recklessness.The crisis has been building inexorably since President Trump’s foolish renunciation last year of the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, his imposition of swingeing sanctions, and a campaign of “maximum pressure” to isolate and weaken Iran’s leadership. It looks and smells like a crude bid for regime change. And although Trump insists he does not want it, his actions could soon trigger another calamitous Middle East war.That’s not a risk most people or states are ready to countenance. And so far, at least, Washington’s parallel, virtual battle for consent and support is not going the way American hawks hoped. Mike Pompeo, the bully-boy evangelist who doubles as US secretary of state, rarely loses an opportunity to demonise Iran. Aware of post-Iraq scepticism over US intelligence claims, he noisily insists, with a creeping tinge of panic, on the accuracy and veracity of his “evidence”.Yet the problem for Pompeo, and fellow Iranophobe, national security adviser John Bolton, is that while most western governments probably believe that hardline elements within Iran, or Iranian-backed proxy forces, initiated last week’s tanker attacks and similar incidents last month, they also believe gratuitous US provocations may have forced Iran’s hand. They don’t believe Trump when he says he merely wants Iran to act “normal”. But they do suspect the ultimate Bolton-Pompeo aim is a putsch.The foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, to Britain’s shame, has tamely applauded Washington’s dodgy video dossier. But the Europeans, rightly, don’t buy it. The EU backs diplomacy, not sabre-rattling, and is still pursuing alternative barter arrangements to circumvent US sanctions. Russia, naturally, opposes the US. But China, in an unusually outspoken rebuff, said Washington’s destabilising, unilateral behaviour “has no basis in international law”.Iran’s neighbours have serious misgivings too. The impulsive and autocratic crown princes who run Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Salman and Mohamed bin Zayed, are the local equivalent of Bolton and Pompeo. Like them, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu is egging the Americans on. But next-door Iraq has zero interest in a renewed conflict, likewise Turkey and weaker Gulf states.Nor is the US public, despite years of White House fearmongering, fully aboard the “Get Iran” bandwagon. A Reuters/Ipsos survey last month found that nearly half of Americans – 49% – disapprove of Trump’s handling of Iran. Just over half – 53% – saw Iran as a “serious” or “imminent” threat. But 60% said they wouldn’t support a pre-emptive US military strike on the Iranian military.Resistance to the US hawks’ pell-mell rush to confrontation is coming most strongly from within Iran itself. Its foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, cuts a cool and thoughtful figure in contrast to Pompeo. He stresses how unilateral US sanctions, especially on oil exports, do unjustifiable harm to Iran’s people and the international economy. His is an effective pitch to global opinion.Iran also points out that, unlike the US, it is in full compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. This week’s warning from Tehran that it may soon breach enrichment limits is a calibrated response. It’s unfortunate. But it does not amount to “nuclear blackmail”, as the US claims, since Iran has no bomb and, according to the UN, is not seeking one. What it does amount to is diplomatic leverage with third-party states fearful of more Middle East chaos.Iran is highlighting the unintended consequences of any conflagration, and the precedent-setting illegitimacy, both legal and moral, of threatened US actions. And then, more dangerously, there is its apparent, increasing willingness to employ a measure of physical resistance, be it through military proxies or, for example, hardliners in the Revolutionary Guards Corps. This is potentially explosive.It would be a mistake to think Iran is totally in control of its responses to this unfolding crisis any more than the US. There are bellicose hawks in Iran’s national security council, clerical establishment and the supreme leader’s office, just as there are in the White House. Hassan Rouhani’s pragmatic presidency, the majlis (parliament), the merchant class and state-controlled media all represent rival power centres with differing views on what to do next.Iran’s is a society under extreme duress. Sanctions are undoubtedly biting deep and patience with the west is waning. The risk is growing that, in extremis, some regime elements will hit out forcefully – and there is no doubt they have the ability to do so, in the Gulf, in Lebanon, in Gaza, and on the Israel-Syria and Saudi-Yemen borders. US hawks would say that’s exactly why Iran must be contained, and very possibly it should. But do they really believe, after serial past failures, they have the power, the will, the backing and the mandate to do so?Reducing conflict to black and white images of good and evil is not only misleading. It is also delusional. Some now recall the Gulf “tanker war” during the Iran-Iraq conflict that culminated, in 1988, with brief US “surgical strikes” on Iranian oil rigs and ships. In US lore, those strikes taught Iran a swift lesson, obliging it to back off. In truth, Iran was already on its knees after eight years of war with Saddam Hussein. That is absolutely not the situation now.Unnecessarily aggressive, ill-considered – and deceptively presented – US policies have once again brought the Middle East to the brink of an accidental war very few want. America’s European friends, including Britain, have an urgent responsibility to talk it down – and drag it back from the abyss.• Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",The Iran crisis was created in Washington.

"The sophistication of the attacks on two shipping tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week had already led most independent analysts to conclude Iran was responsible for the high-profile explosions.But there has been scepticism from some key countries, including Germany and Japan, after the US initially released a grainy black and white video it said showed Iranian forces removing an unexploded mine from one of the two targeted ships. Iran has denied involvement.The fresh set of colour images released by the US Department of Defense overnight add a little more visual clarity to the diplomatic debate, including an image of an armed speedboat with troops in red life-jackets on board, and life-jacketed personnel by the side of the Japanese vessel that was struck last week.But the principal evidence used to justify Iranian involvement has been the method employed. The two tankers were mined above the waterline – damaging them, but not sinking them – prompting the conclusion the actions were designed to make a point. There were no fatalities in either case, with both crews rescued.Jack Watling, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said the attacks were “very precise, to avoid the risk of an oil spill”, to make the point that “Iran can impose a cost on the United States, and that the US can’t police the waterway around the strait of Hormuz”.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst 'chokepoint'In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Phillip InmanBoth ships hit last Thursday were operating 19 and 21 nautical miles off Iran – just beyond the 12-mile territorial limit – in the crowded waterways through which 40% of the world’s internationally traded crude passes. Oil prices rose 4.5% on the day.The mines used were small. Another photo released by the US shows a limpet mine attached to the Japanese vessel, the Kokuka Courageous, which did explode, creating a hole 1.5 metres high and 1.1 metres wide; dramatic enough when pictured, but again not enough to threaten the ship.The wider argument used to justify Iran’s involvement is that it would make sense as a response by the country to what it perceives as the economic warfare waged by the US in withdrawing from the nuclear deal and imposing sanctions. “The status quo for Iran is unacceptable,” Watling said.David Wearing, a teaching fellow at Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, cautions that the US and its regional allies are “not reliable narrators”, partly because it is in Washington’s interest “to narrow debate to the question of whether or not Iran is guilty of these attacks to present their own aggression as defensive”.But he acknowledged the evidence so far suggested it was probable Iran was directly involved. “They would likely be attempting to strengthen their hand in this standoff by demonstrating their ability to impose costs on their opponents,” the analyst added.The release of the images was followed by the announcement that the US was sending another 1,000 troops to the Middle East, a modest show of strength designed to reinforce Washington’s argument about culpability.A British assessment has also concluded Iranian forces were responsible for the tanker attacks, but there is not understood to be any immediate plans for the UK to step up its military commitment to the region.Watling believes Tehran can avoid further recrimination “as long as there is sufficient ambiguity”, partly because few believe that Donald Trump, who campaigned on an isolationist agenda, wants war – and because the backing obtained

"Tehran has sped up the countdown to its breach of the nuclear deal with the announcement that it will exceed its uranium stockpile limit in the next 10 days, raising heightened tensions in the region even further.The country’s atomic agency also said Tehran might also start the process of enriching uranium up to 20%, closer to weapons-grade, from 7 July.The announcement by Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman for the Iranian Atomic Energy Authority, puts more pressure on Europe to come up with new terms for the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondentThe initial response from European leaders was negative. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, urged Iran to be patient and responsible and the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: “We will certainly not accept a unilateral reduction of obligations.”The US was more forthright. A National Security Council spokesman accused Iran of nuclear blackmail.The EU agreed an unpublished timetable of its own with Tehran last week to help ease trade between Iran and European nations, but it is not clear whether the measures will come quickly enough or be sufficient to persuade Iran to rethink its strategy of chipping away at the nuclear deal.Iran says it is acting after Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal unilaterally a year ago. The EU has since proved itself incapable of protecting its private-sector firms from the threat of US secondary sanctions if they try to trade with Iran. US sanctions have brought down Iran oil exports to 400,000 barrels a day, well below the levels needed to fund government spending.Washington and the UK have blamed attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week on Iran. Tehran has denied any involvement and described them as a false flag operation. The EU has yet to apportion blame.Iran’s army chief, Maj Gen Mohammad Hossein Baqeri, said on Monday that if Iran ever decided to block the export of oil from the Gulf, it would do so openly, without resorting to deception or covert operations, unlike the “terrorist and deceptive” US.Under the terms of the nuclear agreement, Iran can keep a stockpile of no more than 300kg (660lbs) of low-enriched uranium. In a briefing on Monday, Kamalvandi said that given Iran’s recent decision to quadruple its production of low-enriched uranium, it would pass the limit on 27 June.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service. Saudi Arabia subsequently blames Iran for the attack.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It's not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: 'If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!'Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom's south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US 'spy' drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker, Grace 1, the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row. Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.The UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said last month that Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium was 174.1kg in late May.Iran said the breach was likely partly because the US had placed sanctions on Iranian exports of uranium.Iran also announced water supplies at the Arak water reactor would exceed a 130-tonne limit within the next two and a half months if the country did not find a client to buy heavy water byproducts.Kamalvandi said Iran needed 5% enrichment for its nuclear power plant in the southern Iranian port of Bushehr and 20% enrichment for a Tehran research reactor. His formulation did not amount to a firm commitment to reach 20% levels.The nuclear deal had limited Iran to enriching uranium only to 3.67%, which is enough for power plants and peaceful purposes.Tehran first set the 7 July deadline, after which it might boost enrichment, six weeks ago. Kamalvandi reiterated that stance, saying Tehran would increase uranium enrichment levels “based on the country’s needs”.Enriching a supply of uranium means boosting its concentration of the isotope U-235, which can power a nuclear reaction. It also involves stripping away atoms of another isotope, U-238.When uranium is mined it typically has about 140 atoms of U-238 for every atom of U-235. Refining it to a purity of 3.67% means using centrifuges to remove 114 unwanted atoms of U-238 for every atom of U-235.Boosting its purity to 20% means removing 22 more unwanted atoms of U-238 per atom of U-235, while going from there to weapons-grade material means removing just four more per atom of U-235. Ninety percent is considered weapons-grade.In an attempt to dramatise Iran’s decision, Kamalvandi spoke to Iranian journalists in a news conference at the country’s Arak heavy water nuclear reactor. Such reactors produce plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons. Under the nuclear deal, Iran had reconfigured the facility to address western concerns on that issue.Kamalvandi said the country could rebuild the facility with Chinese help to make it produce plutonium. He also said Iran would continue to allow the UN to inspect its nuclear facilities.",Iran to break uranium stockpile limit set by nuclear deal in 10 days,2019-06-17/18:59:09,tehran has sped up the

"Mohammed bin Salman has spoken publicly for the first time since a second attack on Saudi oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, blaming arch-rival Iran and vowing that Saudi Arabia “won’t hesitate to deal with any threat” to the kingdom’s interests.According to an interview for pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat, published on Sunday, the crown prince said: “We do not want a war in the region ... But we won’t hesitate to deal with any threat to our people, our sovereignty, our territorial integrity and our vital interests.“The Iranian regime did not respect the presence of the Japanese prime minister as a guest in Tehran and responded to his [diplomatic] efforts by attacking two tankers, one of which was Japanese.”The attack on two tankers – the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous, which was carrying highly flammable methanol when it was rocked by explosions, and the Norwegian-operated Front Altair – came around the time the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was meeting Iranian leaders in Tehran. It was the second attack in a month in the strategic shipping lane.Meanwhile, in a move likely to increase tensions, Iran will announce on Monday further steps to scale back compliance with the international nuclear pact that the US abandoned last year.Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation will announce moves to increase stocks of enriched uranium and production of heavy water at its Arak site. The Iranians plan a blaze of publicity around the steps as a warning to Europe that it must do more to boost trade with Iran, or face serious consequences.Divisions over responsibility for last week’s attack have deepened amid fears of a major regional confrontation over the strategic shipping channel, despite hints by Donald Trump about possible negotiations with Iran.Speaking on Sunday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that while it was “unmistakable” that Iran was responsible for the attacks on two tankers, the US did not want to go to war with Tehran.In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Pompeo said: “President Trump has done everything he can to avoid war. We don’t want war.” But he added that Washington would guarantee free navigation through vital shipping areas.“The United States is going make sure that we take all the actions necessary, diplomatic and otherwise that achieve that outcome. The intelligence community has lots of data, lots of evidence. The world will come to see much of it,” said Pompeo, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency before becoming secretary of state.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said on Sunday Britain was “almost certain” Iran was behind the oil tanker attacks, adding that London did not believe anyone else could have done it.Speaking on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, he said it was “extraordinary, when there is clear evidence of tankers being blown up in the country, we have Jeremy Corbyn saying this is America’s fault”.He said it showed the Labour party leader was not fit to be prime minister. Corbyn said on Friday there was no credible evidence Iran was responsible.Hunt said: “The great risk of the situation we are in is both sides in this dispute think the other would not want a war.”Iran has denied carrying out Thursday’s sabotage, disputing footage released by the US military that purports to show Iranian naval commandos removing an unexploded mine from the hull of one of the stricken tankers.The UK’s ambassador to Tehran, Robert Macaire, went to the Iranian foreign ministry on Thursday to set out the UK’s claims that Iran was responsible for the oil tanker attacks.He denied Iranian reports that he had been summoned, saying he would have been happy to meet the Iranian government without the need for a summons.The Iranian government has singled out the UK as the only major European country to back the US intelligence assessment. The UK set out its own independent intelligence in a statement on Friday evening, but stressed it still believed a diplomatic route was the best way to de-escalate the crisis.The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said on Saturday: “The video is not enough. We can understand what is being shown, sure, but to make a final assessment, this is not enough for me.”Maas was in Tehran before the oil tanker attack last weekfor talks to salvage the nuclear deal that is still backed by Germany, France and the UK.France has also not yet backed the US -UK judgment that the attack could be attributed to Iran with certainty.On Saturday, the UAE’s foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, called on world powers “to secure international navigation and access to energy”, a plea echoed by regional ally Saudi Arabia after the incident sent crude prices soaring.Iran has repeatedly warned it could block the strategic strait of Hormuz in a relatively low-tech, high-impact countermeasure to any attack by the US. Doing so would disrupt oil tankers travelling out of the Gulf region to the Indian Ocean and global export routes.The two damaged tankers arrived safely on Sunday at locations off the Emirati coast. Maritime experts will seek to transfer the highly flammable cargo on board the Kokuka to shore, according to an unnamed official quoted by Japanese state media.The Japanese trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, said at a G20 meeting in Japan on Saturday: “From a viewpoint of global energy security, it is necessary for the international community to jointly deal with the act.”Agence France-Presse

"For much of this year, two beliefs have held firm in the halls of power in Iran: US attempts to strangle its economy cannot be tolerated and Donald Trump has no intention of going to war.Far from wilting under the barrel of a global superpower’s guns, Iran’s leaders have signalled an intent to defend their interests, by damaging those of their foes. Iran’s anger at the US, and its alleged role in the attacks on six tankers in Gulf waters over the past five weeks did not emerge from a vacuum. US-imposed sanctions have taken a huge toll on its economy, and diminished its ability to service long-lasting commitments across the region – in Syria and Lebanon, in particular.Tehran’s access to oil markets has been crippled by a sanctions regime that has proven more targeted and comprehensive than ever before. At the same time, enemies across the Gulf are selling oil to its former customers. To leave either unaddressed would be to signal weakness, say regional officials familiar with Iranian leadership.What to do about it has been the subject of intense debate in Tehran and discussion with proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon – long the apex of Iran’s foreign policy projection. As has how to square away Trump’s oscillating public stances; hours after tweeting on Friday that neither side was ready for a deal, the US leader said: “We want to get them back to the table”.The shifting views are likely to further support a view in Iran that Trump is far from the shrewd negotiator he seems – to himself – to be. More carpet-seller than Kissinger, he seems unaware of Iran’s leverage, in regard to its dormant nuclear programme, ignorant of its culture and unsure on his feet as tensions between both sides escalate.There is next to zero chance of a Kim Jong-un style showboating summit between Trump and Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and every chance that even in the highly unlikely event such a meeting did take place he would walk away with less than he did in Singapore.Iranian officials have told confidantes in Iraq that they view Trump as the epitome of US shortcomings; a leader with neither the patience or perspective to allow for deals to be made. Tehran has indicated that if sanctions relief isn’t forthcoming by 8 July, it will no longer abide by key parts of the nuclear deal – including sticking to bans on uranium enrichment. No longer would its nuclear programme be verifiable – winding back all of the achievements of Barack Obama’s signature policy.Iran’s gains in the region in the past 16 years have been profound – a fact largely attributable to US misadventures, the most prominent of which was to hand over the centre of the Arab world to Iran’s influence. Despite a price tag that easily surpasses a trillion dollars, there is barely a sign that “liberated” Iraq even wants a strategic relationship with Washington.While undoubtedly under stress from sanctions, Tehran still has cards to play, and leaders who know how to hold a hand.

"Divisions over responsibility for last week’s attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman deepened this weekend amid warnings over the danger of a major confrontation in the region, despite hints by Donald Trump about possible negotiations with Iran.Politicians in Britain traded angry blows over the incident, after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, questioned whether there was “credible evidence” that Iran had attacked the two ships as they passed by its coast on Thursday, rebuffing a Foreign Office assessment that it was “almost certain” that a “branch of the Iranian military” had carried out the strikes.“Britain should act to ease tensions in the Gulf, not fuel a military escalation that began with US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement,” Corbyn tweeted. “Without credible evidence about the tanker attacks, the government’s rhetoric will only increase the threat of war.”The comments drew an immediate rebuke from the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who described them as “pathetic and predictable”. Earlier the FCO had said: “No other state or non-state actor could plausibly have been responsible,” and pointed to a “recent precedent for attacks by Iran against oil tankers”.The row came as tensions between the regional heavyweight and Washington remained high, three days after an attack that sent tremors through oil markets and sparked fears of widespread disruption to the global oil trade, much of which passes through Gulf waters.Iran has denied carrying out the attacks – the second strikes in a month on Gulf shipping – disputing footage released by the US military that purports to show Iranian naval commandos removing an unexploded mine from the hull of one of the crippled tankers.US defence officials said on Friday that prior to the attack, Iranian forces had fired an anti-aircraft missile at a US drone that had been monitoring their activity close to the tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Officials said the Reaper drone took images of Iranian vessels closing in on the two tankers that were attacked but did not say whether there was any visual evidence of the attack itself.President Trump has sent mixed signals over how he wants to address the crisis, which erupted as the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was in Tehran, carrying an offer of talks from the White House.After Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, rejected the offer, Trump disowned Abe’s mission and tweeted that it was “too soon to even think about making a deal” with Iran’s leaders. “They are not ready, and neither are we!”However, in the same interview on his favourite television talk show, Fox & Friends, on Friday morning, in which he said “Iran did it”, the US president also said: “They’ve been told in very strong terms we want to get them back to the table.”Hunt was among several candidates for the Tory leadership to attack Corbyn for his remarks. Michael Gove accused the Labour leader of “failing to stand up for our values of freedom and democracy”. Dominic Raab accused him of “anti-American prejudice”. Labour MP John Mann, a leading party critic, also denounced his leader’s comments.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, appeared to soften Labour’s stance on the issue, saying that there needed to be further “processes” to establish whether Iran was behind the attack. She suggested that Iran could have carried out the tanker attack after taking the “bait” of western sanctions.“These are extremely dangerous developments and we really have to pause and think about where we are going next,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Thornberry insisted that the main issue was avoiding “British forces being drawn into a conflict of that size”.“We’ve got to give up on this idea that if the United States go into war, especially one engineered by the likes of John Bolton and the neocons, we have to stop and say there are times when we don’t just follow,” Thornberry said.“We made a dreadful mistake when it came to Iraq and we must not make the same mistake again.”Saudi Arabia’s crown prince blamed Iran for attacks, according to an interview with the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat newspaper. “The Iranian regime did not respect the Japanese prime minister’s visit to Tehran and while he was there replied to his efforts by attacking two tankers, one of which was Japanese,” the newspaper quoted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as saying on its Twitter account.The head of the Arab League has called on the Iranians to “be careful and reverse course”. In New York, the league’s secretary general Ahmed Aboul Gheit said: “We believe that responsibilities need to be clearly defined. The facts will be revealed, I am sure, it’s only a matter of time.“My call to my Iranian – and I call them Iranian – brothers: Be careful and reverse course because you’re pushing everybody towards a confrontation that no one would be safe if it happens.”And the United Arab Emirates’ top diplomat said evidence indicates that recent attacks against oil tankers inside UAE waters were “state-sponsored”. But Russia has warned against rushing to assign blame for the attacks and accused the US of using its accusations against Iran to stoke tensions in the region.",Iran-US dispute grows over attacks on

"The attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman has escalated tensions between the US and Iran and raised fears of a surge in global energy prices.Concerns over a spike in prices centre on Tehran’s potential to close the strait of Hormuz, the narrow shipping lane between Iran and Oman and the world’s most strategically important oil route.Some ship owners have already taken matters into their own hands after Thursday’s oil tanker attack, the second in as many months, by barring their oil-laden vessels from moving through the strait.The owners are seeking safety assurances, and are understood to be in talks to secure a naval escort for their cargoes through the waterway, through which almost a third of the world’s oil shipping passes.One senior London-based ship broker said a number of tankers in the area are unwilling to move without these assurances.“They are very concerned. Think of the volume of traffic which goes through the strait every day. A naval escort for each laden tanker would take time. Most charters are taking a step back to assess what measures could be taken,” he said.Donald Trump played down fears Iran might close off the strait. The US president told Fox News on Friday that if it did happen “it’s not going to be closed for long”.Paolo d’Amico, the chair of the tanker trade group Intertank, said the industry is extremely worried. “We need to remember that some 30% of the world’s crude oil passes through the strait. If the waters are becoming unsafe, the supply to the entire western world could be at risk,” he said.Around 18 million barrels of oil are forecast to travel through the straits every day in 2020. This is more than half the 29.8 million barrels produced by members of the Opec oil cartel.It is also a major avenue for Qatar’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, or roughly 30% of the global LNG trade. UK gas supplies would not be affected by a short-term closure of the strait.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared in 2019, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service. Saudi Arabia subsequently blames Iran for the attack.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It's not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: 'If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!'Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom's south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US 'spy' drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.  Donald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker, Grace 1, the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, verifies that Tehran has breached the agreed 3.67% limit for enriched uranium.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats 'attempted to impede' a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Despite US attempts in the courts to prevent it, Gibraltar says it will free oil tanker at centre of the Iran row. Iran gives assurances the oil is not destined for Syria, where selling it would breach international sanctions against Britain accuses Iran of breaching those assurances after Tehran acknowledged the oil had been sold, and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.One London-based gas trader confirmed that no UK-bound tanks were en route through the straits at the time of the attack. Europe also has plenty of gas reserves after a mild winter, which should mean most of Qatar’s shipments will head east to buyers in Asia.A long-term closure or restriction of traffic, however, would undoubtedly lead to higher gas prices and an economic boom for exporters in the US and Russia, he said.The oil price climbed by a relatively modest 4% to $62.64 a barrel after the attacks in the Gulf of Oman, which is the gateway to the strait of Hormuz for inbound vessels, but experts say a prolonged hiatus could trigger record oil prices and reignite the risk of a global recession.“We’re talking hundreds of dollars,” said Chris Midgley, the head of analytics at the oil market specialists S&P Global Platts.“This would have a dramatic effect on the whole economy, right down to consumer spending. Every major recession we have seen has been preceded by a ramping up of global commodity prices … this would raise a huge recessionary risk,” he said.Midgley said he expected diplomatic efforts to see off the risk of a complete closure, but that the world was nonetheless closer than it has ever been to an energy chokehold.“In the days when the US had a huge dependence on energy from the Middle East it had a huge military presence in the area to ensure that the straits would remain open. What is different today is that the US has its energy independence. This is a significant change,” he said.The US shale revolution means the former energy importer will become a net exporter of oil for the first time this year.A global escalation in oil and gas prices could provide an economic boom for the country, but Trump is likely to weigh the benefit against the impact on consumer energy bills.“The US still has a strong incentive to defuse the situation, and China – which relies heavily on energy imports - will also be motivated to step in,” Midgley said. “A shutdown of the straits would be the ultimate ‘nuclear’ option for Iran,.”",Oil tanker attacks

"The US military has released video footage which it says shows an Iranian military patrol boat approaching one of two tankers attacked in the Gulf of Oman, to support the Trump administration’s claims that Iran was responsible.The blurry black and white footage, taken from the air, shows a small military boat alongside the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous, and someone standing up on the prow of the boat to remove an object from the tanker’s hull. The boat then pulls away from the tanker.US officials were quoted as saying the boat was an Iranian Revolutionary Guard patrol boat approaching the tanker after it was attacked on Thursday, and the object removed was an unexploded limpet mine. It was unclear whether it was being alleged the Iranian sailors were detaching the mine in order to remove evidence.Thursday’s attacks increased tension between the US and Iran, which are locked in a standoff after Washington imposed economic sanctions on Tehran in an attempt to force the renegotiation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.The incidents also added to security fears over oil tankers travelling through the strait of Hormuz – a chokepoint for the global oil and gas trade – and appeared to have ended a Japanese-led mediation effort between Tehran and Washington.The US military also released a photo it claimed showed a mine on the side of the Kokuka Courageous and some damage to the hull.The operator of the tanker suggested the vessel was struck by a missile. The crew saw “flying objects” just before it came under attack, according to Yutaka Katada, the president of the Tokyo-based owner, Kokuka Sangyo.The vessel’s crew had spotted an Iranian naval ship nearby, he added, but did not say whether that was before or after the attack, which damaged the tanker’s starboard side.Donald Trump called Iran a ""nation of terror” on Friday and said the US had “exposed” Iran’s responsibility for the attacks. “Iran did do it,” the US president said in an interview with Fox & Friends.On Thursday Mike Pompeo said the US believed the blasts were caused by the Iranian military “based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation”. The US secretary of state claimed the attacks had such a high degree of sophistication they could not have been carried out by a proxy.Pompeo took no questions after making his allegations. He said Iran had been responsible for previous attacks on tankers last month, but the official investigation into those incidents did not determine who had been responsible. Tehran denied all responsibility for Thursday’s attacks and its foreign minister, Javad Zarif, suggested others could be trying to provoke a conflict between Iran and the US. On Friday he tweeted that the US had “immediately jumped to make allegations against Iran without a shred of factual or circumstantial evidence”.The incident took place on a day when Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, bluntly rejected the proposal of a resumption of US-Iranian talks, as suggested by Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, on a visit to Tehran. Abe is widely thought to have had the blessing of Trump in offering to open a channel of communication between the US and Iranian leaders.But after Khamenei’s rejection and the tanker attacks, the US president followed suit, posting a tweet saying: “I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready, and neither are we!”The blasts on the Kokuka Courageous and the Norwegian-owned Front Altair pushed oil prices up by 4% and could further raise insurance premiums for vessels operating in the Gulf.Crew members from both vessels were rescued. One Kokuka Courageous crew member sustained burns on his hands and was treated by a US navy medical team.Iran’s English-language Press TV aired footage of rescued crewmen from the Front Altair, saying they are all in “full health”.“Everything is OK,” said one of the vessel’s “chief officers”, presenting himself as Russian and thanking Iran for its “hospitality”.Press TV said 11 of the crew were Russian, 11 Filipino and one Georgian.Confirming the involvement of its ships, US Central Command issued a statement saying it would not tolerate any attempt to interfere in its operations but insisted it was not interested in conflict. Saudi Arabia supported Pompeo’s claims. Its foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said on Thursday: “We have no reason to disagree with the secretary of state. We agree with him.”The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said his assumption was that the intelligence assessment of the US, Britain’s closest allies, was correct, but that the UK would make its own inquiries. Hunt said he was “very worried that both sides in the crisis think the other side does not want war. The risk you have is that they do something provocative that leads to unintended catastrophic consequences.”Khamenei dismissed the notion of talks with the US, saying in a series of tweets: “I do not consider Trump as a person worth exchanging any message with and I have no answer for him, nor will I respond to him in the future.”He said Iran had no plan to build nuclear weapons, but if it wished to do so, the US would be unable to stop it. Pompeo said the attacks on the tankers were intended as an insult to the Japanese leader. “Iran’s supreme leader rejected Abe’s diplomacy today by saying he has no response to President Trump and will not answer,” he said.The US put its allegations before a closed session of the United Nations security council on Thursday. Iran responded by accusing the US of stoking tensions and mounting an “economic war” against its people.",US says video shows Iranian military removing mine from tanker,2019-06-14/14:18:21,the us

"Two oil tankers were attacked, leaving one ablaze and the other adrift, in the second such incident in a month near the strait of Hormuz, a major strategic waterway for world oil supplies.Taiwan’s state oil refiner CPC said the Front Altair, owned by Norway’s Frontline, was hit at about 4am GMT while carrying a Taiwan-bound cargo of 75,000 tonnes of naphtha, a petrochemical feedstock. CPC said it was suspected the boat had been torpedoed but other reports suggested a mine attack was more likely. The crew were picked up by a passing boat and handed over to an Iranian rescue vessel.The Kokuka Courageous sustained damage to its hull while transporting methanol from Saudi Arabia to Singapore, its owner, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said. The operator of the tanker suggested it was struck by a missile. A shipping broker told Reuters the blast might have been caused by a magnetic mine. Its crew was also rescued – one suffered burns on his hands and was treated by a US Navy medical team.The US military has released video footage it says shows an Iranian military patrol boat approach one of the two tankers. The blurry black and white footage, taken from the air, shows a small military boat alongside a tanker and someone standing up on the prow of the boat to remove an object from the tanker’s hull.

It was unclear whether it was being alleged the Iranian sailors were detaching the mine in order to remove evidence.The US military also released a photo it claimed showed a mine on the side of the tanker and some damage to the hull.Iran has denied all responsibility and its foreign minister suggested others could be trying to provoke a conflict between Iran and the US.On 12 May, four oil tankers – two Saudi-flagged, one Norwegian-flagged and one Emirati-flagged – were damaged by explosions in waters off the United Arab Emirates.A UAE-led inquiry published on 7 June found it was “highly likely” that four limpet mines, which are magnetically attached to a ship’s hull under the waterline, were used in the attacks. The report said they had been placed by trained divers deployed from fast boats. The mines were placed soon after the ships were anchored.The inquiry blamed an unidentified state actor.

"The explosions were bigger and the damage more extensive. But the message and its means of delivery have some similarities.Thursday’s attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman caused jitters in global markets and unease across a region that has been bracing for conflict throughout much of the year. As with the earlier attacks on 12 May, news of the latest strikes was again broken by media outlets aligned to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran, who broadcast images of the attacks within minutes of them taking place.Pictures of both ships ablaze spoke volumes about what is at stake in one of the world’s most strategic waterways, as a regional player withering under ever tightening sanctions stares down a global superpower determined to impose its will.Even the hint of obstruction in the strait of Hormuz, where ships pass each other like cars on a four lane motorway, is enough to upset oil markets. Frequent, and seemingly random, bombings of tankers, however, takes fears over energy security to levels not seen since the tanker wars, a byproduct of the Iran-Iraq war of the mid-80s, which sunk or damaged 543 ships in nearby waters and caused three years of turmoil in energy markets. By Thursday afternoon, two large shipping companies had suspended bookings from the Gulf oil ports.The standoff between Iran and the US, which has brewed over the course of Donald Trump’s administration, has typically played out on terra firma. In Iraq, Iran has consolidated its presence at the expense of Washington, which has little to show for its efforts to reorientate the country in its favour. In Lebanon Iran’s near dominance of the political space has taken place at Saudi Arabia’s – and Washington’s – expense.On seas and oceans US interests – and those of its allies – are even more vulnerable, with tankers carrying nearly one third of the world’s oil, or derivatives of it, passing within a few miles of the Iranian coastline as they travel from the strait of Hormuz to all points of the industrialised world.As US sanctions have taken hold, Iran has increasingly struggled to secure revenues from oil exports that use the same seaborne lanes. Iranian leaders have made no bones about how important the Gulf waters are to the country’s economy – and to the coffers of its foes. As was the case in May, the new attacks targeted ships carrying cargo from Saudi and Emirati ports.In February, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s national security council, threatened the closure of the strait, if its oil exports were threatened. “There are multiple ways to make that happen,” he said. “We hope we would not be forced to use them.”Iran strenuously denied involvement in the May attacks and, in remarks on Thursday, appeared to be following suit. Javad Zarif, the foreign minister, described the attacks as “beyond suspicious” and Iranian media suggested an attack on a Japanese-owned tanker taking place at the same time Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe was meeting Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei pointed to a plot.Iran views Trump with contempt, but on balance believes the economic war launched by his administration, and military threats, are designed not to start a bombing war, but to shore up a negotiating position, vis-a-vis a bid to redraw the nuclear deal that was signed by his predecessor, and torn up by Trump last year.Khamenei is known to be vigorously opposed to any new talks, particularly from a perceived position of weakness, and has told subordinates to carefully calibrate any response to US moves, which he believes aim to wind back its regional gains since the US-led ousting of Saddam Hussein and bring his regime to heel.If, as US officials were already suggesting on Thursday, the latest attacks can be traced to Iran, the will of both sides faces a searching test in the coming days and weeks. Washington is currently all in on a confrontational approach that combines a comprehensive economic squeeze with military muscle. Iran, meanwhile, remains defiant, while engaging in calibrated prods to remind foes of its reach.Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst and Iran project director for the International Crisis Group, observed: “If Iran is behind these attacks, it clearly shows that a US policy relying solely on coercion can backfire. Diplomatic efforts by allies are necessary to dial down the tension, but they can’t resolve it as long as Washington relies on an all-or-nothing approach.”","Oil tanker attacks will inflame conflict between the US, its allies and Iran",2019-06-13/17:34:05,the explosions were bigger and the damage more extensive but the message and its means of delivery have some similarities thursday s attacks on two oil tankers in the gulf of oman caused jitters in global markets and unease across a region that has been bracing for conflict throughout much of the year as with the earlier attacks on  may news of the latest strikes was again broken by media outlets aligned to hezbollah in lebanon and iran who broadcast images of the attacks within minutes of them taking place pictures of both ships ablaze spoke volumes about what is at stake in one of the world s most strategic waterways as a regional player withering under ever tightening sanctions stares down a global superpower determined to impose its will even the hint of obstruction in the strait of hormuz where ships pass each other like cars on a four lane motorway is enough to upset oil markets frequent and seemingly random bombings of tankers however takes fears over energy security to levels not seen since the tanker wars a byproduct of the iran iraq war of the mid s which sunk or damaged  ships in nearby waters and caused three years of turmoil in energy markets by thursday afternoon two large shipping companies had suspended bookings from the gulf oil ports the standoff between iran and the us which has brewed over the course of donald trump s administration has typically played out on terra firma in iraq iran has consolidated its presence at the expense of washington which has little to show for its efforts to reorientate the country in its favour in lebanon iran s near dominance of the political space has taken place at saudi arabia s and washington s expense on seas and oceans us interests and those of its allies are even more vulnerable with tankers carrying nearly one third of the world s oil or derivatives of it passing within a few miles of the iranian coastline as they travel from the strait of hormuz to all points of the industrialised world as us sanctions have taken hold iran has increasingly struggled to secure revenues from oil exports that use the same seaborne lanes iranian leaders have made no bones about how important the gulf waters are to the country s economy and to the coffers of its foes as was the case in may the new attacks targeted ships carrying cargo from saudi and emirati ports in february ali shamkhani the secretary of iran s national security council threatened the closure of the strait if its oil exports were threatened there are multiple ways to make that happen he said we hope we would not be forced to use them iran strenuously denied involvement in the may attacks and in remarks on thursday appeared to be following suit javad zarif the foreign minister described the attacks as beyond suspicious and iranian media suggested an attack on a japanese owned tanker taking place at the same time japanese prime minister shinzo abe was meeting iranian supreme leader ali khamenei pointed to a plot iran views trump with contempt but on balance believes the economic war launched by his administration and military threats are designed not to start a bombing war but to shore up a negotiating position vis a vis a bid to redraw the nuclear deal that was signed by his predecessor and torn up by trump last year khamenei is known to be vigorously opposed to any new talks particularly from a perceived position of weakness and has told subordinates to carefully calibrate any response to us moves which he believes aim to wind back its regional gains since the us led ousting of saddam hussein and bring his regime to heel if as us officials were already suggesting on thursday the latest attacks can be traced to iran the will of both sides faces a searching test in the coming days and weeks washington is currently all in on a confrontational approach that combines a comprehensive economic squeeze with military muscle iran meanwhile remains defiant while engaging in calibrated prods to remind foes of its reach ali vaez senior iran analyst and iran project director for the international crisis group observed if iran is behind these attacks it clearly shows that a us policy relying solely on coercion can backfire diplomatic efforts by allies are necessary to dial down the tension but they can t resolve it as long as washington relies on an all or nothing approach ,Iran Sanctions,0.270149529

The US blamed those attacks on Iran – an accusation Tehran has denied.The timing of Thursday’s attacks was especially sensitive because it came as the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, held talks with the Iranian leadership in Tehran in an effort to find a basis for discussions between the US and Iran.

Iran and the Yemeni rebels both follow branches of Shia Islam but Tehran has always denied providing more than moral support to the rebels.

"Saudi Arabia has said it will carry out urgent reprisals as it accused Iran of being behind a late-night cruise missile attack by Houthi rebel fighters on a Saudi international airport that injured 26 people.The Saudi foreign ministry said the Command of Joint Forces of the Coalition promised it “will take urgent and timely measures to deter these Iranian-backed terrorist Houthi militias”.The attack on Abha airport was condemned across the Middle East and by the US defence department.The Saudi-backed Yemeni government, which has been fighting a four-year civil war against the Houthi rebels, claimed the missile directed at the airport had been supplied by Iran, even claiming Iranian experts were present at the missile’s launch.Iran strongly denies Saudi claims of aiding the Houthi movement.The Houthi rebels insist they have a right to defend themselves from a Saudi directed blockade, and reported an initial Saudi reprisal that hit densely populated areas in the north of the country.Diplomats will fear that the conflict in Yemen is spilling over into the dispute between Washington and Tehran, particularly if the US backs claims that Iran is directing the increasingly sophisticated Houthi attacks deep into Saudi territory.A Houthi military spokesman promised the group would target every airport in Saudi Arabia and that the coming days would reveal “big surprises”.No fatalities were reported in the airport attack, which hit the arrivals hall, but the number of civilians wounded was the largest in any Houthi attack inside Saudi Arabia.The Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel said the missile hit its intended target, Abha airport, near the Yemen border, disrupting flights. The rebels have also carried out drone strikes on Saudi oil installations and may have been responsible for recent attacks on oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.A UAE-led investigation into the shipping attacks was unable to identify the culprits, but said a state-supported actor was involved.The precise extent to which Iran is providing military assistance to the Houthi movement is a matter of dispute, but UN reports suggest it has provided weaponry.Iran operates through surrogates, but has looked as if it was seeking ways to reduce tensions with the US. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, arrived in Tehran on Wednesday, carrying what Iran expects is a message on behalf of Donald Trump that sets out US conditions for direct talks.Iran is threatening to pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal unless the US relaxes economic sanctions that are crippling the the country’s economy. Trump pulled the US out of the deal last year.A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, Turki al-Maliki, was quoted by the state-run Al Ekhbariya news channel as saying three women and two children were among those hurt, and that eight people were taken to hospital while 18 sustained minor injuries.A Houthi spokesman, Mohamed Abdel Salam, said the attack was in response to Saudi Arabia’s “continued aggression and blockade on Yemen”. Earlier in the week, he said attacks on Saudi airports were “the best way to break the blockade” of the airport in Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, which the rebels overran in late 2014. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in the conflict since, relief agencies say.Another Houthi spokesman, Brig Gen Yahia Sarie, was quoted as saying that the missile struck and destroyed the air traffic control tower and that US-made air defence systems were unable to intercept it.The Saudis said on Tuesday that they had intercepted two drones aimed at the south-western city of Khamis Mushait, which has an airbase.The Yemeni government’s information minister, Muammar al-Eryani, said the targeting of Abha airport confirmed that Tehran was supplying the Houthi militia with ballistic missiles and expertise, adding that Iran’s policy of escalating the conflict was a clear challenge to those calling for calm.He said “the Iranian project in Yemen is to use the territory to implement its subversive agenda. including threatening the energy sources and corridors of international trade”.A limited and sporadically honoured UN ceasefire exists around the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah, but the Saudi-backed government is increasingly angry at what its regards as the one-sided approach of the UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths.The UN reiterated its support for Griffiths’ work this week in a UK-sponsored statement, while the Yemeni foreign minister, Khaled al-Yamani, was reported to have resigned after what was seen as a rift with Riyadh over the antagonism towards Griffiths.The escalation between the Houthi movement and Saudi Arabia comes at a critical moment in the dispute between the US and Iran. Tehran is threatening to resume enriching uranium towards weapons-grade level on 7 July if US sanctions are not lifted or its European allies fail to offer new terms for the nuclear deal.Before boarding his plane at Tokyo’s Haneda airport, Abe acknowledged the challenges ahead. “There are concerns over rising tension in the Middle East,” he said. “Japan wants to do as much as possible towards peace and stability in the region.”In a sign that Abe hopes he can achieve a breakthrough in the US-Iran impasse, he spoke this week to Trump, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, , Mohammed bin Salman, and his counterpart in Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, all of whom are fierce critics of Tehran.The danger is that the dispute could grow from a row over the terms of the nuclear deal into a wider struggle over Iran’s behaviour across the Middle East. The US special representative for Syria engagement, James Jeffrey, said on Tuesday that Iran’s presence in Syria was part of a “hegemonic quest to dominate the Middle East”.Agence France-Presse

"Iran’s foreign minister has warned the US it “cannot expect to stay safe” after launching what he described as an economic war against Tehran.Speaking alongside the German foreign minister in Tehran on Monday, Javad Zarif said Iran would not start a war but “whoever starts a war with us will not be the one who finishes it”.He also set the bar high for any talks with the US, saying: “President Trump himself has announced that the US has launched an economic war against Iran. The only solution for reducing tensions in this region is stopping that economic war.”The bilateral talks with his German counterpart, Heiko Maas, were described as frank by Zarif, normally a sign that the two countries did not reach common ground. Germany is the lead country in Europe trying to set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to ease trade between Europe and Iran without falling foul of US economic sanctions. Iran has repeatedly urged the European Union to make the SPV operational, arguing increased trade with Iran was integral to its efforts to win domestic support for the nuclear deal signed in 2015.The US withdrew from the nuclear deal in May last year and is imposing a policy of maximum economic pressure to cut trade with Iran and reduce its oil exports, the lifeblood of the Iranian economy.Maas said Germany and its European partners had “made the greatest effort to meet [their] commitments”, but in the face of threatened US sanctions against European companies that trade with Iran, said they could not perform miracles.Maas acknowledged the economic benefits Tehran hoped for from the deal were now “more difficult to obtain”. But he urged Iran not to go ahead with planned graduated steps to reduce its commitments to the deal, but instead to fully to respect the agreement. It is in Iran’s “political and strategic interest to maintain this agreement and the dialogue with Europe”, he said.Tehran is due to take further steps to leave the deal on 7 July, when it says it will increase its level of uranium enrichment over the limits agreed in the 2015 nuclear deal.Defending Iran’s regional foreign policy from claims it has been disruptive, Zarif turned the tables by asking a series of questions largely aimed at Saudi Arabia’s foreign policy. “Was it us that gave arms to Saddam Hussein? Did we support al-Qaida? Did we imprison the prime minister of Lebanon? Are we bombing Yemeni civilians every day? Did we support Isis and the Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria, or were American weapons provided by Saudi Arabia?”He also urged European countries to wean themselves off the dollar as the chief currency for international trade. “America’s power rests on the dollar; a great part of America’s economic power will go away if countries eliminate the dollar from their economic systems,” he said.Later this week the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, will meet the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, amid speculation Abe might act as a message carrier between Tehran and Washington on any steps that could be taken to reduce tensions. Abe is close to Trump, but has not supported the US decision to pull out of the nuclear deal, and might be able to act as a broker for talks.“In a further call for calm, the UN’s nuclear watchdog said on Monday it was “worried about increasing tensions” over Iran’s nuclear programme, after Tehran said it might stop respecting more elements of a 2015 international deal.“I ... hope that ways can be found to reduce current tensions through dialogue,” International Atomic Energy Agency director general Yukiya Amano said in a speech opening the agency’s quarterly board meeting.The IAEA said Iran was increasing its stocks of enriched uranium, as it had threatened to do a month ago, but the watchdog could not calculate by what date these stockpiles would breach the limits set in the nuclear agreement.",Iran's foreign minister warns US 'cannot expect to stay safe',2019-06-10/13:08:13,iran s foreign minister has warned the us it cannot expect to stay safe after launching what he described as an economic war against tehran speaking alongside the german foreign minister in tehran on monday javad zarif said iran would not start a war but whoever starts a war with us will not be the one who finishes it he also set the bar high for any talks with the us saying president trump himself has announced that the us has launched an economic war against iran the only solution for reducing tensions in this region is stopping that economic war the bilateral talks with his german counterpart heiko maas were described as frank by zarif normally a sign that the two countries did not reach common ground germany is the lead country in europe trying to set up a special purpose vehicle spv to ease trade between europe and iran without falling foul of us economic sanctions iran has repeatedly urged the european union to make the spv operational arguing increased trade with iran was integral to its efforts to win domestic support for the nuclear deal signed in  the us withdrew from the nuclear deal in may last year and is imposing a policy of maximum economic pressure to cut trade with iran and reduce its oil exports the lifeblood of the iranian economy maas said germany and its european partners had made the greatest effort to meet their commitments but in the face of threatened us sanctions against european companies that trade with iran said they could not perform miracles maas acknowledged the economic benefits tehran hoped for from the deal were now more difficult to obtain but he urged iran not to go ahead with planned graduated steps to reduce its commitments to the deal but instead to fully to respect the agreement it is in iran s political and strategic interest to maintain this agreement and the dialogue with europe he said tehran is due to take further steps to leave the deal on  july when it says it will increase its level of uranium enrichment over the limits agreed in the  nuclear deal defending iran s regional foreign policy from claims it has been disruptive zarif turned the tables by asking a series of questions largely aimed at saudi arabia s foreign policy was it us that gave arms to saddam hussein did we support al qaida did we imprison the prime minister of lebanon are we bombing yemeni civilians every day did we support isis and the jabhat al nusra in syria or were american weapons provided by saudi arabia he also urged european countries to wean themselves off the dollar as the chief currency for international trade america s power rests on the dollar a great part of america s economic power will go away if countries eliminate the dollar from their economic systems he said later this week the japanese prime minister shinzō abe will meet the iranian president hassan rouhani amid speculation abe might act as a message carrier between tehran and washington on any steps that could be taken to reduce tensions abe is close to trump but has not supported the us decision to pull out of the nuclear deal and might be able to act as a broker for talks in a further call for calm the un s nuclear watchdog said on monday it was worried about increasing tensions over iran s nuclear programme after tehran said it might stop respecting more elements of a  international deal i hope that ways can be found to reduce current tensions through dialogue international atomic energy agency director general yukiya amano said in a speech opening the agency s quarterly board meeting the iaea said iran was increasing its stocks of enriched uranium as it had threatened to do a month ago but the watchdog could not calculate by what date these stockpiles would breach the limits set in the nuclear agreement ,Iran Sanctions,0.278584182
"Saudi Arabia is a force for disruption across the Middle East and Africa and often uses blackmail and economic pressure to enforce its brand of authoritarian rule, Qatar’s foreign minister has alleged.In recent weeks the Saudis and Emiratis have been accused of interfering to stifle popular movements in Sudan, Libya and Somalia.In a briefing in London, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani appeared to accept that an unresolved two-year quarrel between Qatar and Saudi Arabia was starting to fuel other disputes across the region, making those disputes more difficult to resolve. Saudi Arabia, along with the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt, launched an economic and political boycott of the gas-rich Qatar two years ago, partly in objection to the Qataris’ foreign policy, including alleged support for the Muslim Brotherhood.At the briefing, the foreign minister acknowledged the dispute was spilling over across the region, citing Libya and Somalia as two countries in which the Saudis have been determined to install regimes sympathetic to Riyadh.“Qatar has been subject to a lot of efforts mainly led by Saudi and the UAE to demonise us,” Thani said. “Some of the countries, especially in the need for support of the Saudis and the UAE, have even been blackmailed to follow the same policy against Qatar. It creates a lot of instability in the Horn of Africa and the sub-Saharan area. Mainly the focus has been Africa, but there have been attempts elsewhere. Africa has been the focus because many of the countries are in need of help and support.”He added: “They try with everybody – in some places they succeed to a certain level, some succeed 100% and some have failed.”With the Saudis and the Emiratis presenting themselves as bulwarks of stability and a force against terrorism, Thani challenged their definitions, saying political stability comes through inclusion. “Any country that is not led by an authoritarian, they see as terrorists,” he said. “A terrorist can include anyone who disagrees with them.”He said Saudi foreign policy in the past three years had led to “nothing positive” in Lebanon, Libya or Yemen.Without directly accusing the Sudanese military of being under Riyadh’s instruction, Thani said “a brutal massacre” had occurred in the country last week, describing Sudan as crucial for the whole region.In Somalia, the government had been subject to Saudi blackmail, he said, after it refused to sever links with Qatar.The issue of the original Qatar-Saudi dispute, and how it may be spilling into other countries, is likely to be the subject of discussion between the Emir of Qatar and Donald Trump when the two leaders meet in Washington next month. Trump is close to the Saudi leadership, but there is a growing mood in Congress pressing his administration to be more critical of Saudi foreign policy.The foreign minister added that Qatar was willing to join the group of mediators trying to prevent a conflict between Iran and the US, but said he believed Iran would not sit down with the US until economic sanctions were lifted.Thani said: “At some point there should be an engagement. It cannot last for ever. If neither party is willing to engage in further escalation, both parties need to come up with some ideas to open the doors. We have to be active in advocating that.”Qatar, which has a vast US military base from which a US attack on Iran may be mounted, disagrees with Trump’s policy on Iran, but is desperate to avoid a confrontation between the two which it fears will be an existential threat to the region.Thani also said Qatar was willing to support any plan to end the Israel-Palestinian conflict, but only if it had the agreement of the Palestinians.

"An unidentified state actor has been blamed for attacks on four oil tankers in the Gulf last month, according to an inconclusive inquiry that stopped short of explicitly pointing the finger at Iran.The UAE along with Saudi Arabia and Norway presented the preliminary findings during a private briefing to members of the UN security council, which will also receive the final results of the inquiry and consider a possible response.The US has accused Iran of almost certainly being behind the attacks on the four oil tankers off the Emirati coast, but the brief report, while providing evidence of the sophistication of the attack, goes nowhere near identifying the culprit. Nonetheless, Saudi Arabia today alsoblamed Tehran, its arch rival.The UAE may be waiting to see whether other intelligence agencies can provide evidence that Iran directed surrogate groups, or possibly Houthi rebels, to carry out the attack.The four vessels – two Saudi-flagged, a Norwegian-flagged and an Emirati-flagged – were damaged by explosions in UAE territorial waters, off the port of Fujairah.The UAE is convinced Iran was behind the attacks and that they were designed to send a clear message to the US and the Gulf states about its capacity to wreak havoc on oil shipping, including through the Strait of Hormuz.Iran is battling the effects of US sanctions, including on its ability to export oil, the lifeblood of its economy.The initial findings showed it was “highly likely” that four limpet mines, which are magnetically attached to a ship’s hull under the waterline, were used in the attacks. The report said they had been placed by trained divers deployed from fast boats. The mines were placed soon after the ships were anchored.The UAE believes the attacks required high-level intelligence in order to identify the four oil tankers as targets, one of which – a Saudi ship – was at the opposite end of the anchorage area at Fujairah from the three other tankers.The report also said that detailed knowledge of the ships’ designs was required to detonate the mines without sinking the tankers. The mines were sequenced to explode within an hour of each other.Despite the ambiguous findings, Saudi Arabia continued to blame its arch-enemy, Iran. Tehran has denied involvement.“We believe the responsibility for this attack lies on the shoulders of Iran,” Saudi Arabia’s UN ambassador, Abdallah al-Mouallimi, said after the briefing. Saudi Arabia maintains that the attacks affect the safety of international navigation and the security of world oil supplies, requiring a response from the security council.Russia’s deputy ambassador to the UN, Vladimir Safronkov, said after the closed-door briefing that no evidence had been presented linking Iran to the attacks. “We shouldn’t jump to conclusions,” Safronkov said. “This investigation will be continued.”Tehran reacted coolly to the findings, saying the UAE was determined to blame it as part of an effort to escalate the situation and press the US into a war with Iran.In an attempt to calm tensions the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is due to visit Tehran next week as a mediator between the US and Iran. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, is also due to visit Tehran before Abe’s trip.Germany remains a signatory to the nuclear deal signed in 2015 from which Donald Trump withdrew in May 2018.Trump then pursued a policy of strong economic sanctions against Iran but he has dialled down his bellicose rhetoric in the last week, waiting to see if any of the mediators can find a basis for setting up direct talks between him and Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president. Iran will demand the lifting of economic sanctions as a precondition of talks.On Friday Tehran again ruled out extending the nuclear deal to cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme, something the French president, Emmanuel Macron, suggested should be addressed this week.France, Germany and the UK have stood by the nuclear deal but have largely failed to find a financial mechanism that protects European companies from the threat of US sanctions if they trade with Tehran. Iran’s oil exports have plummeted and there is a lively debate in Tehran on whether it is tenable to hold out against talks.Iran is due to show reporters around its heavy water reactor in an attempt to show the implications of the measures it is taking to increase the level of enriched uranium. In response to the US economic pressure, Tehran says it is taking steps to extricate itself from the deal, with the next steps on uranium enrichment due in 30 days.Germany and Japan are certain to urge Iran to hold back from taking any steps that could be interpreted as abandoning the deal.Speaking at a conference in Bratislava, Anwar Gargash, the UAE’s foreign affairs minister, said the Iran nuclear deal had not delivered “a peaceful and normal Iran”.He said: “We are faced with escalation in the region and bellicose rhetoric from Iran, which continues to foster and use sectarianism as a means to insert itself into the Arab world.”The Iran deal, he said, “did not tackle this dangerous ballistic missile programme or Iran’s regional policies, which include interference in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon and support for proxy forces including the terrorist group Hezbollah”.",Inquiry into oil tanker attacks stops short of blaming Iran,2019-06-07/12:12:49,an unidentified state actor has been

"Since the signing of the Atlantic charter in 1941, the central tenet of British foreign policy is that the UK can act as a bridge between the US and Europe, or as a pivot on which transatlantic relations turn.But the larger question posed by Donald Trump’s visit to the UK this week for British policymakers is whether this role remains credible when the two seem to be drifting further apart, and so few in Europe would choose the UK to mediate anything.Before his visit, Trump has been quite explicit in interviews that the British divorce from the EU should mean a stronger alliance with the US and looser relations with Brussels, which he detests.If necessary, the UK should walk out on Europe, refuse to pay the bills and seal a quick bilateral trade agreement with Washington that can act as a substitute for the loss of access to markets in Europe. It is a version of the advice the president gave the UN general assembly last year: reject the ideology of globalism and embrace the doctrine of blue-collar patriotism.John Bolton, the US national security adviser, has also been explicit in telling British audiences that the corollary of Brexit can be a closer relationship with the US.“As a separate nation again, Britain’s impact on the world has the prospect of being even greater. I think it will help us in Nato in particular to have another strong and independent country that will help Nato to be more effective, and that has to be a plus,” he said. “America declared its independence once, and we made out OK.” Bolton even suggested that, freed from EU, the UK might break with Germany and France by joining the US in rejecting the Iran nuclear deal.It is conceivable that Boris Johnson, should he become prime minister, might want to chart Bolton’s course. But for the moment, the difficulty for the UK is that there is effectively no one at the helm. Trump is undertaking a state visit at a time when the Queen is head of state but there is no fully functioning state.As such, in between the pomp and circumstance, it will mainly be a time for testing the parameters of the future relationship. Transatlanticists, such as Johnson, see huge potential for cooperation. If there is to be a no-deal Brexit, how quickly and on what terms could the UK and US lower tariffs? If this is to happen as early as October, the details of a trade deal need nailing down.Equally, Britain will be looking for details on national security cooperation, including on Huawei. Last week Bolton gave the impression there was a confluence of British and US technical thinking.In discussing the Middle East – Britain’s other great concern – Whitehall will politely make the case for consistent US engagement. On Libya, Syria and Yemen, Washington’s thinking often seems opaque, the subject of unresolved interagency rivalries or at the whim of an early morning presidential tweet.Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, will brief UK officials on his soon to be released Middle East plan, which emphasises economic but not political rights for Palestinians, such as the two-state solution in which the UK and the Arab world still believes. Britain will argue the Kushner plan is necessary but not sufficient for peace.Ministers will look into whether the US believes the intelligence exists to justify a military assault on Iran’s proxies, including the Houthis in Yemen. If not, what evidence is there to show the US strategy of maximum economic pressure is strengthening internal opposition to the government in Tehran, or bringing the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, closer to the negotiating table? Is Trump really willing to impose sanctions on European companies over Iran?For all the talk about strengthening links with the US and the markets of the future, there will be many in Whitehall urging caution about letting the bridge to Europe fall into disrepair, and ridiculing Trump’s suggestion that a US trade deal can compensate for the loss of European markets.But for the next few days at least, expect the Conservative party to be lured by Trump’s siren voice. It will be music to their ears.",Will Donald Trump's state visit renew the 'special relationship'?,2019-06-02/13:06:42,since the signing of the atlantic charter in  the central tenet of british foreign policy is that the uk can act as a bridge between the us and europe or as a pivot on which transatlantic relations turn but the larger question posed by donald trump s visit to the uk this week for british policymakers is whether this role remains credible when the two seem to be drifting further apart and so few in europe would choose the uk to mediate anything before his visit trump has been quite explicit in interviews that the british divorce from the eu should mean a stronger alliance with the us and looser relations with brussels which he detests if necessary the uk should walk out on europe refuse to pay the bills and seal a quick bilateral trade agreement with washington that can act as a substitute for the loss of access to markets in europe it is a version of the advice the president gave the un general assembly last year reject the ideology of globalism and embrace the doctrine of blue collar patriotism john bolton the us national security adviser has also been explicit in telling british audiences that the corollary of brexit can be a closer relationship with the us as a separate nation again britain s impact on the world has the prospect of being even greater i think it will help us in nato in particular to have another strong and independent country that will help nato to be more effective and that has to be a plus he said america declared its independence once and we made out ok bolton even suggested that freed from eu the uk might break with germany and france by joining the us in rejecting the iran nuclear deal it is conceivable that boris johnson should he become prime minister might want to chart bolton s course but for the moment the difficulty for the uk is that there is effectively no one at the helm trump is undertaking a state visit at a time when the queen is head of state but there is no fully functioning state as such in between the pomp and circumstance it will mainly be a time for testing the parameters of the future relationship transatlanticists such as johnson see huge potential for cooperation if there is to be a no deal brexit how quickly and on what terms could the uk and us lower tariffs if this is to happen as early as october the details of a trade deal need nailing down equally britain will be looking for details on national security cooperation including on huawei last week bolton gave the impression there was a confluence of british and us technical thinking in discussing the middle east britain s other great concern whitehall will politely make the case for consistent us engagement on libya syria and yemen washington s thinking often seems opaque the subject of unresolved interagency rivalries or at the whim of an early morning presidential tweet jared kushner donald trump s son in law will brief uk officials on his soon to be released middle east plan which emphasises economic but not political rights for palestinians such as the two state solution in which the uk and the arab world still believes britain will argue the kushner plan is necessary but not sufficient for peace ministers will look into whether the us believes the intelligence exists to justify a military assault on iran s proxies including the houthis in yemen if not what evidence is there to show the us strategy of maximum economic pressure is strengthening internal opposition to the government in tehran or bringing the iranian president hassan rouhani closer to the negotiating table is trump really willing to impose sanctions on european companies over iran for all the talk about strengthening links with the us and the markets of the future there will be many in whitehall urging caution about letting the bridge to europe fall into disrepair and ridiculing trump s suggestion that a us trade deal can compensate for the loss of european markets but for the next few days at least expect the conservative party to be lured by trump s siren voice it will be music to their ears ,Iran Sanctions,0.155304119
"Evidence that Iran has been behind recent attacks on oil tankers and pipelines in the Gulf is likely to be presented to the UN Security Council as early as next week, John Bolton, the US national security adviser, has revealed.Bolton has previously said Iran was almost certainly responsible for the attacks, but without presenting evidence. In what is likely to be a showdown over the US’s aggressive Iran strategy, in which Bolton has taken a leading role, much will depend on how credibly the US intelligence agencies can show the Iranian government is directing attacks by proxies.“I don’t think anybody who is familiar with the situation in the region, whether they have examined the evidence or not, thinks anything other than that these attacks were carried out by Iran or their surrogates,” Bolton told reporters at a briefing ahead of Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK next week.Four oil tankers off the United Arab Emirates suffered damage this month from explosions, which Bolton said were Iranian naval mines. He also disclosed a previously unknown attempt to attack the Saudi oil port of Yanbu.The attacks on the tankers followed the sending of a US aircraft carrier and a bomber taskforce to the Middle East in response to “a credible threat” by Iranian regime forces.Bolton said on Thursday the threat from Iran was not over but claimed there was some evidence that the swift despatch of additional US troops and assets to the region had served as a deterrent.The USS Abraham Lincoln and B-52 bombers were sent on the recommendation of the military, Bolton said, even though in an unusual move for a national security adviser he had personally made the announcement.Bolton also extended Iranian responsibility for the war in Yemen by saying Iran should be held accountable for the drone attacks on civilian and military airports, oil installations and shipping in the Red Sea being undertaken by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.He said the Houthis did not make the drones, but must have got then from somewhere. “I think it is fair to hold Iran accountable without even further information because of the foreseeable consequences of giving such weapons,” he said.Bolton has a long history of calling for the Iranian regime to be toppled, but denied that he was at odds with Trump by pressing for a policy of regime change in Iran.“Before I became national security adviser I said and wrote a lot of things on every subject,” he said. “It is all out there. I believed everything I said at the time and I still do. I am the national security adviser, I am not the national decision maker. The policy we are pursuing is not regime change. That is a fact and everyone should understand that.”He added Trump was quite prepared to hold direct talks with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, but that Iran had to abandon its nuclear ambitions.Bolton, appointed national security adviser in April last year, also defended the US policy of secondary sanctions designed to prevent European governments facilitating trade between European and Iranian companies. Some European leaders have said the policy of secondary sanctions turns the EU into a vassal state, but Bolton hit back saying “it is perfectly legitimate for the US in an effort to protect itself from the threat of a nuclear Iran to utilise the lawful instruments of economic power to the extent that it can”.He said Trump, on his upcoming state visit to the UK, was also likely to raise the pending UK government decision on whether to allow the Chinese firm Huawei access to 5G networks. Bolton claimed the intelligence community was only belatedly coming to an understanding of how hard it would be protect infrastructure from Chinese state interference, adding the once perceived distinction between core and peripheral networks may not apply with 5G. He said “this is not some philosophical disagreement if it can be mitigated against”.He said: “I am not sure this is a decision that has reached the prime minister in final form. It cannot be resolved in one meeting. We all want to make sure that we have a common understanding of what the technology involves.”Bolton also said Trump would not be shy in expressing his support for Brexit. He said: “The president supports carrying out the will of the British people. He looks forward to the successful resolution of that process and he looks forward to bilateral trade agreements with the UK. America declared its independence once, and we made out OK.”","Evidence Iran was behind Gulf attacks to be presented to UN, John Bolton says",2019-05-30/23:24:55,evidence that iran has been behind recent attacks on oil tankers and pipelines in the gulf is likely to be presented to the un security council as early as next week john bolton the us national security adviser has revealed bolton has previously said iran was almost certainly responsible for the attacks but without presenting evidence in what is likely to be a showdown over the us s aggressive iran strategy in which bolton has taken a leading role much will depend on how credibly the us intelligence agencies can show the iranian government is directing attacks by proxies i don t think anybody who is familiar with the situation in the region whether they have examined the evidence or not thinks anything other than that these attacks were carried out by iran or their surrogates bolton told reporters at a briefing ahead of donald trump s state visit to the uk next week four oil tankers off the united arab emirates suffered damage this month from explosions which bolton said were iranian naval mines he also disclosed a previously unknown attempt to attack the saudi oil port of yanbu the attacks on the tankers followed the sending of a us aircraft carrier and a bomber taskforce to the middle east in response to a credible threat by iranian regime forces bolton said on thursday the threat from iran was not over but claimed there was some evidence that the swift despatch of additional us troops and assets to the region had served as a deterrent the uss abraham lincoln and b  bombers were sent on the recommendation of the military bolton said even though in an unusual move for a national security adviser he had personally made the announcement bolton also extended iranian responsibility for the war in yemen by saying iran should be held accountable for the drone attacks on civilian and military airports oil installations and shipping in the red sea being undertaken by yemen s houthi rebels he said the houthis did not make the drones but must have got then from somewhere i think it is fair to hold iran accountable without even further information because of the foreseeable consequences of giving such weapons he said bolton has a long history of calling for the iranian regime to be toppled but denied that he was at odds with trump by pressing for a policy of regime change in iran before i became national security adviser i said and wrote a lot of things on every subject he said it is all out there i believed everything i said at the time and i still do i am the national security adviser i am not the national decision maker the policy we are pursuing is not regime change that is a fact and everyone should understand that he added trump was quite prepared to hold direct talks with the iranian president hassan rouhani but that iran had to abandon its nuclear ambitions bolton appointed national security adviser in april last year also defended the us policy of secondary sanctions designed to prevent european governments facilitating trade between european and iranian companies some european leaders have said the policy of secondary sanctions turns the eu into a vassal state but bolton hit back saying it is perfectly legitimate for the us in an effort to protect itself from the threat of a nuclear iran to utilise the lawful instruments of economic power to the extent that it can he said trump on his upcoming state visit to the uk was also likely to raise the pending uk government decision on whether to allow the chinese firm huawei access to g networks bolton claimed the intelligence community was only belatedly coming to an understanding of how hard it would be protect infrastructure from chinese state interference adding the once perceived distinction between core and peripheral networks may not apply with g he said this is not some philosophical disagreement if it can be mitigated against he said i am not sure this is a decision that has reached the prime minister in final form it cannot be resolved in one meeting we all want to make sure that we have a common understanding of what the technology involves bolton also said trump would not be shy in expressing his support for brexit he said the president supports carrying out the will of the british people he looks forward to the successful resolution of that process and he looks forward to bilateral trade agreements with the uk america declared its independence once and we made out ok ,Iran Sanctions,0.314579725
"A possible US-backed thaw in Qatari-Saudi relations has been signalled by Qatar’s prime minister agreeing to attend a major summit in Mecca on alleged Iranian aggression in the region.The attendance of Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa al-Thani at the summit, confirmed by Al Jazeera, the Qatari-owned news channel, on Wednesday, will be seen as the biggest sign of rapprochement between the two countries. The Saudis launched a sweeping economic and political blockade against the gas-rich country two years ago, accusing Doha of trying to undermine Saudi Arabia, fund terrorism and promote the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East.King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, of Saudi Arabia, invited Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, to attend the emergency Gulf cooperation council summit on Iran’s alleged role in attacking Gulf shipping and oil installations. Al Jazeera said Sheikh Abdullah would attend in his place, the first high-level contact between the two countries for more than two years.The summit will be held on Thursday in Mecca. A Qatari plane carrying one of its diplomats was allowed to land in Saudi for the first time in two years on Monday.Saudi airspace remains closed for all other Qatari flights, as it has been since the start of the boycott.Qatar – unlike Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates – has so far maintained its support for the Iran nuclear deal. Although determined to follow an independent foreign policy, it will not be seeking to alienate Donald Trump by spurning Washington’s pressure to curtail Iranian aggression in the region. Qatar has an economic interest in ensuring gas and oil installations are not the subject of attacks by Iranian proxy forces. It also acts as the host to the largest US military base in the Gulf.Riyadh has accused Tehran of ordering the recent drone attacks on two oil-pumping stations in the kingdom, claimed by Yemen’s Houthis.Iran denied it was behind the attacks and a succession of Iranian politicians have said they are not seeking a military confrontation, although they want crippling US economic sanctions to be lifted.The Saudi-owned news outlet Arab News urged Washington to launch a surgical strike against Iran, but this view was not universally held across Saudi media.Washington has blown hot and cold in its demands on Iran, with Trump saying he was not seeking regime change in Tehran, merely a renegotiation of the nuclear deal. He said the deal was full of loopholes that allowed Tehran to achieve nuclear breakout too rapidly.Qatar is likely to urge caution on all sides, as well as privately appeal to Tehran not to sponsor proxies to attack Saudi oil assets. The Houthi rebel forces in Yemen, increasingly capable of mounting drone attacks, have the ability to operate independently from Iran.Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, has been trying to counter Saudi diplomacy by holding bilateral meetings in the region, including in Qatar, Kuwait and Oman. The US has been putting private pressure on Saudi Arabia and Qatar to bury their differences ahead of the imminent publication of the Middle East peace plan by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. The “deal of the century”, due to be discussed at the economic workshop for Gulf finance ministers in Manama, Bahrain, in June, centres on a plan to help the Palestinian territories economically. Kushner is touring the region to promote the plan and to try to secure political buy-in. He is also due to join Trump on his state visit to the UK at the start of June.Qatar has been one of the largest humanitarian funders of Gaza, and Doha’s buy-in for any economic reconstruction plan is highly prized by Washington.But any suggestion a thaw in Saudi-Qatar relations will easily turn into a full-blown rapprochement seems unlikely. Marking the second anniversary of the start of the boycott, Qatar’s foreign minister recalled “the stabbing of the Qatari people in a premeditated crime of piracy, fabrication, and lies in which the appellant justified its unjust blockade against a country and its people”.",Qatari PM to attend Saudi Arabia summit amid two-year blockade,2019-05-29/18:19:04,a possible us backed thaw in qatari saudi relations has been signalled by qatar s prime minister agreeing to attend a major summit in mecca on alleged iranian aggression in the region the attendance of sheikh abdullah bin nasser bin khalifa al thani at the summit confirmed by al jazeera the qatari owned news channel on wednesday will be seen as the biggest sign of rapprochement between the two countries the saudis launched a sweeping economic and political blockade against the gas rich country two years ago accusing doha of trying to undermine saudi arabia fund terrorism and promote the muslim brotherhood across the middle east king salman bin abdulaziz al saud of saudi arabia invited qatar s emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani to attend the emergency gulf cooperation council summit on iran s alleged role in attacking gulf shipping and oil installations al jazeera said sheikh abdullah would attend in his place the first high level contact between the two countries for more than two years the summit will be held on thursday in mecca a qatari plane carrying one of its diplomats was allowed to land in saudi for the first time in two years on monday saudi airspace remains closed for all other qatari flights as it has been since the start of the boycott qatar unlike saudi arabia bahrain and the united arab emirates has so far maintained its support for the iran nuclear deal although determined to follow an independent foreign policy it will not be seeking to alienate donald trump by spurning washington s pressure to curtail iranian aggression in the region qatar has an economic interest in ensuring gas and oil installations are not the subject of attacks by iranian proxy forces it also acts as the host to the largest us military base in the gulf riyadh has accused tehran of ordering the recent drone attacks on two oil pumping stations in the kingdom claimed by yemen s houthis iran denied it was behind the attacks and a succession of iranian politicians have said they are not seeking a military confrontation although they want crippling us economic sanctions to be lifted the saudi owned news outlet arab news urged washington to launch a surgical strike against iran but this view was not universally held across saudi media washington has blown hot and cold in its demands on iran with trump saying he was not seeking regime change in tehran merely a renegotiation of the nuclear deal he said the deal was full of loopholes that allowed tehran to achieve nuclear breakout too rapidly qatar is likely to urge caution on all sides as well as privately appeal to tehran not to sponsor proxies to attack saudi oil assets the houthi rebel forces in yemen increasingly capable of mounting drone attacks have the ability to operate independently from iran iran s deputy foreign minister seyed abbas araghchi has been trying to counter saudi diplomacy by holding bilateral meetings in the region including in qatar kuwait and oman the us has been putting private pressure on saudi arabia and qatar to bury their differences ahead of the imminent publication of the middle east peace plan by trump s son in law jared kushner the deal of the century due to be discussed at the economic workshop for gulf finance ministers in manama bahrain in june centres on a plan to help the palestinian territories economically kushner is touring the region to promote the plan and to try to secure political buy in he is also due to join trump on his state visit to the uk at the start of june qatar has been one of the largest humanitarian funders of gaza and doha s buy in for any economic reconstruction plan is highly prized by washington but any suggestion a thaw in saudi qatar relations will easily turn into a full blown rapprochement seems unlikely marking the second anniversary of the start of the boycott qatar s foreign minister recalled the stabbing of the qatari people in a premeditated crime of piracy fabrication and lies in which the appellant justified its unjust blockade against a country and its people ,Iran Sanctions,0.32513243
"The Pentagon is considering a US military request to send 10,000 extra troops to the Gulf to beef up defences against potential Iranian threats, US officials have said.Officials told AP that the troops would be defensive forces, and the discussions include additional Patriot missile batteries, more ships and increased efforts to monitor Iran. The move was not in response to any new threat from Iran, but was aimed at reinforcing security in the region, they added.No final decision has been made, and it is not clear if the White House would approve sending all or just some of the requested forces, amid rising regional tensions spurred by Donald Trump’s decision a year ago to pull the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal.On Thursday, a senior German diplomat flew to Tehran to establish precisely what the Iranians want from Europe to stop them pulling out of the deal.Jens Ploetner, a political director in the foreign ministry, was due to meet the Iranian deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi. The UK political director Richard Moore was in Tehran last week, but Ploetner knows Araghchi personally from the original negotiations on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA).Germany is also seen by Tehran as the European power that is doing most to activate a financial system that would encourage trade between Europe and Iran without it being subject to punitive US sanctions.Tensions have been heightening ever since Washington sent more military forces to the Gulf, including an aircraft carrier, B-52 bombers, and Patriot missiles, in a show of force against what US officials say are new Iranian threats to its troops and interests in the region. Iran claims its navy has the US navy under its control in the northern Strait of Hormuz, the waterway used to transport oil from the Gulf.Trump campaigned on pulling the US from the 2015 accord, under which Iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Since the withdrawal, the US has reimposed previous sanctions and come up with new ones, and it has warned nations around the world that they will be subject to sanctions if they import Iranian oil.Iran is sceptical that Europe is willing to confront the US over its threat of sanctions and, as a result, believes Europe is not fulfilling the bargain enshrined in the deal.Tehran claims the US administration is deploying a policy of maximum diplomatic and economic coercion either to force the Iranian regime to renegotiate the deal, or to provoke an economic collapse that leads to mass protests that sweep away the regime.A German diplomatic source said: “There is a window of opportunity for diplomacy to persuade Iran to continue to fully comply with the JCPOA … The situation in the Persian Gulf and the region, and the situation around the Vienna nuclear accord, is extremely serious. There is a real risk of escalation … In this situation, dialogue is very important.”Most large European firms have pulled out of Iran to avoid the threat of US sanctions.Iran has said it will lift limits on uranium enrichment levels in 60 days’ time – a step that is seen by the UK as bring in clear breach of the JCPOA.The US administration, in a closed-door briefing to Congress this week, claimed its intelligence showed that Iranian-influenced forces were behind threats to US forces in Iraq as well as the attack a fortnight ago on oil vessels close to the United Arab Emirates. The quality of the intelligence is disputed by the Democrats.In a sign of the tensions within Iran over the country’s strategy towards the west, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader, criticised the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, and the prime minister, Hassan Rouhani, for entering into the nuclear deal in the first place.","Pentagon to present plans to send 10,000 troops to Middle East, officials say",2019-05-23/15:11:08,the pentagon is considering a us military request to send   extra troops to the gulf to beef up defences against potential iranian threats us officials have said officials told ap that the troops would be defensive forces and the discussions include additional patriot missile batteries more ships and increased efforts to monitor iran the move was not in response to any new threat from iran but was aimed at reinforcing security in the region they added no final decision has been made and it is not clear if the white house would approve sending all or just some of the requested forces amid rising regional tensions spurred by donald trump s decision a year ago to pull the us out of the  nuclear deal on thursday a senior german diplomat flew to tehran to establish precisely what the iranians want from europe to stop them pulling out of the deal jens ploetner a political director in the foreign ministry was due to meet the iranian deputy foreign minister abbas araghchi the uk political director richard moore was in tehran last week but ploetner knows araghchi personally from the original negotiations on the  iran nuclear deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa germany is also seen by tehran as the european power that is doing most to activate a financial system that would encourage trade between europe and iran without it being subject to punitive us sanctions tensions have been heightening ever since washington sent more military forces to the gulf including an aircraft carrier b  bombers and patriot missiles in a show of force against what us officials say are new iranian threats to its troops and interests in the region iran claims its navy has the us navy under its control in the northern strait of hormuz the waterway used to transport oil from the gulf trump campaigned on pulling the us from the  accord under which iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions since the withdrawal the us has reimposed previous sanctions and come up with new ones and it has warned nations around the world that they will be subject to sanctions if they import iranian oil iran is sceptical that europe is willing to confront the us over its threat of sanctions and as a result believes europe is not fulfilling the bargain enshrined in the deal tehran claims the us administration is deploying a policy of maximum diplomatic and economic coercion either to force the iranian regime to renegotiate the deal or to provoke an economic collapse that leads to mass protests that sweep away the regime a german diplomatic source said there is a window of opportunity for diplomacy to persuade iran to continue to fully comply with the jcpoa the situation in the persian gulf and the region and the situation around the vienna nuclear accord is extremely serious there is a real risk of escalation in this situation dialogue is very important most large european firms have pulled out of iran to avoid the threat of us sanctions iran has said it will lift limits on uranium enrichment levels in  days time a step that is seen by the uk as bring in clear breach of the jcpoa the us administration in a closed door briefing to congress this week claimed its intelligence showed that iranian influenced forces were behind threats to us forces in iraq as well as the attack a fortnight ago on oil vessels close to the united arab emirates the quality of the intelligence is disputed by the democrats in a sign of the tensions within iran over the country s strategy towards the west ayatollah ali khamenei the country s supreme leader criticised the iranian foreign minister javad zarif and the prime minister hassan rouhani for entering into the nuclear deal in the first place ,Iran Sanctions,0.408967197
"Once again Iran is the focus of attention for Washington’s foreign policy hawks – and by extension for the rest of us. Donald Trump says he doesn’t want a war with Iran, but his national security adviser, John Bolton, has despatched warships and bombers to the region while the US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has been sharing worrying intelligence about Iranian intentions with close allies and congressional leaders.What’s going on? It’s now a year since Trump tore up the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated in 2015 by the Obama administration along with Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the EU. Since then, egged on by Israel and the Gulf states, he has announced new sanctions, despite Iran’s full compliance with the terms of the deal, and tried bullying the Europeans and others into applying US sanctions in order to deny Iranians the economic benefits they were promised.After a year of waiting to see if the other signatories would make the deal work without US cooperation, the Iranians announced earlier this month that they would no longer fully comply with the uranium and heavy water restrictions of the agreement – and that, unless the Europeans could help with oil and banking within 60 days, more drastic measures would follow. Western governments sometimes forget that the Iranian government is not a monolithic entity, and that the officials they are used to dealing with, such as president Hassan Rouhani and foreign minister Javad Zarif, are under constant pressure from hardliners who point to the lack of any return on the investment Iran made four years ago.Since Trump pulled the plug, the Europeans have been working on a scheme to allow some forms of trade with Iran to continue independently of the US. Its effects have been limited, leading the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, to convince himself – wrongly – that the Europeans were only ever playing good cop to Washington’s bad cop. As US sanctions continue to damage the Iranian economy, Trump says he is still interested in some kind of grand bargain. Tehran should call me, the president says, perhaps not realising that there would be huge political consequences for anyone who did.But outside the US, the impression has grown that the hawks in the Trump administration are more interested in regime change than in policy change – and by military action if necessary. There are shades here of Iraq 2003, when the George W Bush administration was desperate to prove that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. It is nonsense to claim, as Pompeo did last month, that “there is a connection between the Islamic Republic of Iran and al-Qaida. Period. Full stop”. Al-Qaida’s roots are in Sunni, Wahhabist Saudi Arabia, and it hates Shia Iran almost as much as it hates the US and its allies.The Europeans have never disagreed about the nature or extent of Iran’s destabilising activity in the region. But they don’t buy the regime change argument, knowing from experience that outside pressure is more likely to strengthen rather than weaken the hardliners. They also still believe that the best way to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is to stick with the deal.There is now a real risk of the world finding itself with another Middle Eastern conflict on its hands, by accident or miscalculation. What can be done? As many of us have been saying to Iranian officials for some time, they should help others to stand up for the nuclear deal by moderating Iran’s behaviour in the region: stop supplying sophisticated weaponry to Hezbollah in Lebanon; and stop supplying missiles to the Houthi militia in Yemen that perpetuate the horrific civil war. Iran could use its influence over President Bashar al-Assad to press him to avoid further bloodshed in Syria. And it could end the imprisonment and abuse of dual nationals and other Iranian citizens on specious grounds.Some suggest that current tensions may be partly the result of misunderstandings between Tehran and Washington. That wouldn’t be surprising, given the long history of distrust and the absence of diplomatic relations between the two countries for 40 years. But it serves as a reminder that some form of direct communication is essential: both sides should move quickly to activate private channels.Back in 1987 – when the UN security council was trying to stop the Iran-Iraq war Saddam had started (with western encouragement) seven years earlier – the council passed a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal to international borders. It didn’t manage to stop Saddam launching another, ultimately unsuccessful offensive. But tucked away in paragraph eight was a request to the secretary general “to examine, in consultation with Iran and Iraq and with other states in the region, measures to enhance the security of the region”.That resolution is still valid. Why not look again at the idea of all the regional powers, under UN auspices, coming together with a view to lowering tensions? A recent OpEd in the New York Times by Abdulaziz Sager, a Saudi Arabian academic, and Hussein Moussavian, a former Iranian nuclear negotiator, argues that the time for the region’s two big rivals to sit down and try to bury the hatchet might just might have come. So much is at stake that it’s surely worth a try.• Peter Westmacott is a former British ambassador to the US",To defuse this crisis the US must start talking to Iran,2019-05-21/06:00:42,once again

grand bargain tehran should call me the president says perhaps not realising that there would be huge political consequences for anyone who did but outside the us the impression has grown that the hawks in the trump administration are more interested in regime change than in policy change and by military action if necessary there are shades here of iraq  when the george w bush administration was desperate to prove that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction it is nonsense to claim as pompeo did last month that there is a connection between the islamic republic of iran and al qaida period full stop al qaida s roots are in sunni wahhabist saudi arabia and it hates shia iran almost as much as it hates the us and its allies the europeans have never disagreed about the nature or extent of iran s destabilising activity in the region but they don t buy the regime change argument knowing from experience that outside pressure is more likely to strengthen rather than weaken the hardliners they also still believe that the best way to prevent iran acquiring nuclear weapons is to stick with the deal there is now a real risk of the world finding itself with another middle eastern conflict on its hands by accident or miscalculation what can be done as many of us have been saying to iranian officials for some time they should help others to stand up for the nuclear deal by moderating iran s behaviour in the region stop supplying sophisticated weaponry to hezbollah in lebanon and stop supplying missiles to the houthi militia in yemen that perpetuate the horrific civil war iran could use its influence over president bashar al assad to press him to avoid further bloodshed in syria and it could end the imprisonment and abuse of dual nationals and other iranian citizens on specious grounds some suggest that current tensions may be partly the result of misunderstandings between tehran and washington that wouldn t be surprising given the long history of distrust and the absence of diplomatic relations between the two countries for  years but it serves as a reminder that some form of direct communication is essential both sides should move quickly to activate private channels back in  when the un security council was trying to stop the iran iraq war saddam had started with western encouragement seven years earlier the council passed a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal to international borders it didn t manage to stop saddam launching another ultimately unsuccessful offensive but tucked away in paragraph eight was

"The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, has hit back at Donald Trump’s “genocidal taunts” after a strongly worded warning from Trump that Tehran should not think of attacking the US.“Goaded by #B_Team,” Zarif wrote on Twitter, in an apparent reference to Trump advisers such as John Bolton, “@realdonaldTrump hopes to achieve what Alexander, Genghis & other aggressors failed to do. Iranians have stood tall for millennia while aggressors all gone. #EconomicTerrorism & genocidal taunts won’t ‘end Iran’.”He added: “#NeverThreatenAnIranian. Try respect – it works!”Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said late on Monday he favoured talks and diplomacy but not under current conditions, according to state news agency IRNA. “Today’s situation is not suitable for talks and our choice is resistance only,” Rouhani was quoted as saying. Trump said on Monday provocations by Iran – which he called the “No. 1 provocateur of terror.” – would be met with “great force,” but that he was also willing to negotiate.On Sunday, Trump warned Iran not to threaten the US or else it would face its “official end”, shortly after a rocket landed near the US embassy in Baghdad overnight.Trump’s tweet came after he had seemingly sought to soften his tone on Iran following days of heightened tension sparked by his administration’s sudden deployment of bombers and an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf over still unspecified threats.In the time since, officials in the United Arab Emirates have alleged four oil tankers sustained damage in a sabotage attack, Yemeni rebels allied with Iran have launched a drone attack on an oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia, and US diplomats have relayed a warning that commercial airlines could be misidentified by Iran and attacked, something dismissed by Tehran.All these tensions are the culmination of Trump’s decision a year ago to pull the US out of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. And while both Washington and Tehran say they do not seek war, many worry any miscalculation at this fraught moment could spiral out of control.On Sunday a Katyusha rocket fell in Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone, near the statue of the Unknown Soldier less than a mile from the US embassy, causing no injuries. An Iraqi military spokesman, Brig Gen Yahya Rasoul, told the Associated Press that the rocket was believed to have been fired from east Baghdad. The area is home to Iran-backed Shia militias.“If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran,” Trump tweeted. “Never threaten the United States again!”Jeremy Hunt, the UK foreign secretary, urged Tehran to take Trump seriously. Speaking in Geneva, Hunt said: “I would say to the Iranians: do not underestimate the resolve on the US side. They don’t want a war with Iran. But if American interests are attacked, they will retaliate. And that is something that the Iranians needs to think about very, very carefully.”Trump campaigned on pulling the US from the 2015 nuclear accord, under which Iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Since the withdrawal, the US has re-imposed previous sanctions and come up with new ones, and it has warned nations around the world they will be subject to sanctions too if they import Iranian oil.Iran has announced it will begin backing away from terms of the deal, setting a 60-day deadline for Europe to come up with new terms or else it will begin enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels. Tehran long has insisted it does not seek nuclear weapons, though the west fears its programme could allow it to build atomic bombs.In an interview aired on Fox News, Trump called the nuclear deal a “horror show”. “I just don’t want them to have nuclear weapons and they can’t be threatening us,” Trump said.The nuclear deal had kept Iran from being able to acquire enough highly enriched uranium for a bomb. UN inspectors repeatedly certified that Iran was in compliance with the accord.There is an open debate in Tehran over whether Trump is seriously threatening war with Iran or instead using a form of psychological warfare to persuade the Iranians to renegotiate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.On Monday afternoon he tweeted less alarmingly, criticising reports the US was trying to set up talks and adding: “Iran will call us if and when they are ever ready. In the meantime, their economy continues to collapse – very sad for the Iranian people!”",Iran hits back at Trump for tweeting 'genocidal taunts',2019-05-21/02:34:41,the iranian foreign minister javad zarif has hit back at donald trump s genocidal taunts after a strongly worded warning from trump that tehran should not think of attacking the us goaded by b team zarif wrote on twitter in an apparent reference to trump advisers such as john bolton realdonaldtrump hopes to achieve what alexander genghis other aggressors failed to do iranians have stood tall for millennia while aggressors all gone economicterrorism genocidal taunts won t end iran he added neverthreatenaniranian try respect it works iranian president hassan rouhani said late on monday he favoured talks and diplomacy but not under current conditions according to state news agency irna today s situation is not suitable for talks and our choice is resistance only rouhani was quoted as saying trump said on monday provocations by iran which he called the no  provocateur of terror would be met with great force but that he was also willing to negotiate on sunday trump warned iran not to threaten the us or else it would face its official end shortly after a rocket landed near the us embassy in baghdad overnight trump s tweet came after he had seemingly sought to soften his tone on iran following days of heightened tension sparked by his administration s sudden deployment of bombers and an aircraft carrier to the persian gulf over still unspecified threats in the time since officials in the united arab emirates have alleged four oil tankers sustained damage in a sabotage attack yemeni rebels allied with iran have launched a drone attack on an oil pipeline in saudi arabia and us diplomats have relayed a warning that commercial airlines could be misidentified by iran and attacked something dismissed by tehran all these tensions are the culmination of trump s decision a year ago to pull the us out of tehran s nuclear deal with world powers and while both washington and tehran say they do not seek war many worry any miscalculation at this fraught moment could spiral out of control on sunday a katyusha rocket fell in baghdad s heavily fortified green zone near the statue of the unknown soldier less than a mile from the us embassy causing no injuries an iraqi military spokesman brig gen yahya rasoul told the associated press that the rocket was believed to have been fired from east baghdad the area is home to iran backed shia militias if iran wants to fight that will be the official end of iran trump tweeted never threaten the united states again jeremy hunt the uk foreign secretary urged tehran to take trump seriously speaking in geneva hunt said i would say to the iranians do not underestimate the resolve on the us side they don t want a war with iran but if american interests are attacked they will retaliate and that is something that the iranians needs to think about very very carefully trump campaigned on pulling the us from the  nuclear accord under which iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions since the withdrawal the us has re imposed previous sanctions and come up with new ones and it has warned nations around the world they will be subject to sanctions too if they import iranian oil iran has announced it will begin backing away from terms of the deal setting a  day deadline for europe to come up with new terms or else it will begin enriching uranium closer to weapons grade levels tehran long has insisted it does not seek nuclear weapons though the west fears its programme could allow it to build atomic bombs in an interview aired on fox news trump called the nuclear deal a horror show i just don t want them to have nuclear weapons and they can t be threatening us trump said the nuclear deal had kept iran from being able to acquire enough highly enriched uranium for a bomb un inspectors repeatedly certified that iran was in compliance with the accord there is an open debate in tehran over whether trump is seriously threatening war with iran or instead using a form of psychological warfare to persuade the iranians to renegotiate the  iran nuclear deal on monday afternoon he tweeted less alarmingly criticising reports the us was trying to set up talks and adding iran will call us if and when they are ever ready in the meantime their economy continues to collapse very sad for the iranian people ,Iran Sanctions,0.307219863
"For better or worse, America remains the world’s leading military superpower. In Washington last week, a familiar row erupted over how best that power should be used. Past targets have included Soviet Russia, al-Qaida in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Today the international bogeyman topping the White House’s to-do list is Iran.Once again the US is in the process of deciding whether to go to war. As always, it is a tangled, messy and dishonest business. On one side, favouring punitive action, stand the Iran hawks. They include neoconservative retreads such as John Bolton, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, who championed the 2003 Iraq invasion; Mike Pompeo, a former CIA director and Christian evangelical who heads the state department; and Mike Pence, the ascetic US vice-president.On the other side, opposing escalation, stand Democratic party leaders in Congress and a clutch of presidential hopefuls; sceptical Pentagon generals and security agency officials who trust Bolton as far as they can toss an IED; a majority of Washington’s more important allies in the EU and Nato; and China and Russia, which oppose American global power-plays on principle.The focus of the row was secret intelligence, reportedly gathered by US satellites over recent weeks and presented to officials on 3 May. The photographs purported to show Iranian Revolutionary Guards loading missiles onto dhows in the Gulf. Their presumed purpose was to attack American and allied naval or commercial shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the world’s oil supplies pass.The existence of the surveillance photos was top secret – until the information inexplicably leaked to the media last Wednesday. Oddly enough, a few days earlier Saudi Arabia – America’s close ally and sworn foe of Iran – had reported attacks on four tankers in the Strait. Oddly again, no one claimed responsibility and Tehran denied all knowledge. Marine insurers pointed the finger at Iran’s Houthi allies. But while admitting it had no proof, the pro-war camp in Washington immediately blamed Iran or its proxy forces.The reaction from Bolton and Pompeo was swift. Citing yet more secret intelligence that Iran was rallying Shia militias in Iraq and Syria to “prepare for war”, they had already expedited military reinforcements to the Middle East – an aircraft carrier battlegroup and nuclear-armed bombers. Pompeo dramatically cancelled a visit to Germany and flew to Baghdad to warn of the threat.In the wake of the tanker attacks, the administration upped the ante. Details of a White House national security meeting were also leaked. They revealed that Patrick Shanahan, the acting defence secretary, had presented a new plan to send 120,000 troops to the Middle East, supposedly to deter Iran. Another option under discussion was multiple sea and air-launched missile strikes on Iran’s military facilities and suspected nuclear-related targets.Since then, White House officials have persistently talked up an “imminent” threat from Tehran, Pompeo has personally briefed EU governments (he reportedly got a cool reception), and the US embassy in Baghdad has been partly evacuated. But there’s a snag. Throughout this accelerating process of military and diplomatic escalation, the US has not produced any firm, on-the-record evidence of hostile Iranian action.For anybody who recalls the disinformation, untruths and downright lies that preceded the Iraq invasion, the similarities with Iran are uncanny – and disturbing. Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, was among those complaining last week about a blind drift to war. “Did we learn the lessons of the last decade?” asked Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate. “There is an alarming lack of clarity here, there’s a lack of strategy, and there’s a lack of consultation.”Smelling a familiar rat, Democrats are investigating claims that Pompeo’s state department slanted an annual global arms control report to cast Iran in a bad light.In this respect Bolton’s current role is particularly suspect. After Iraq went disastrously wrong, he was widely accused of massaging and manipulating secret intelligence to falsely bolster the case for war. Inaccurate US claims that Saddam possessed and was ready to use weapons of mass destruction – claims infamously echoed by Britain’s the then prime minister Tony Blair – fatally discredited the strategy.Memories of the Iraq fiasco may have influenced Major-General Chris Ghika, the British deputy commander of the coalition against Isis, when he was asked about the American claims last week. “There’s been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria,” he said. Since Ghika is based in Baghdad, he might be expected to know best.That did not stop the Pentagon issuing an extraordinary rebuttal, saying the general’s comments “run counter to the identified credible threats”. In another echo of Iraq, the British government caved in to US pressure and disowned Ghika the following day, saying that it fully agreed with Washington’s threat-level assessment.The crisis began to build in earnest last year when Trump reneged on the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the US, Europe, China and Russia. When signed, the deal was hailed as a major diplomatic achievement, allaying fears Iran was secretly trying to acquire nuclear weapons by imposing strict, independently verifiable curbs. The US decision to trash it was just the start.Trump went on to impose probably the most severe, wide-ranging economic and financial sanctions ever levied, including an embargo on oil sales. He also vowed to punish third countries, including allies such as Britain, if they continued to trade with Tehran.Trump justified his action by claiming the 2015 treaty was a bad deal. Iran might still eventually build a bomb, he claimed, while the pact did not constrain its ballistic missile programme or its “destabilising” regional activities. He just wanted Iran to act like a “normal” country.That was interpreted, in Iran and elsewhere, as a naked bid to enforce regime change. Indeed, Trump has encouraged opposition street protests amid suggestions the regime’s expensive foreign entanglements are unpopular with Iran’s hard-pressed, tax-paying public.In recent weeks, the US has stepped up its so-called “maximum pressure” campaign, designating the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organisation and cancelling remaining waivers allowing some countries to buy Iranian oil. Iran’s oil exports have now fallen to 1 million barrels per day (BPD) or less from a peak of 2.8 million BPD. Exports could fall as low as 500,000 BPD this month.Pompeo and Bolton also set a new trap over proxy forces. Official policy now states that “any attack on US interests or on those of our allies” will be met with “unrelenting force” directed at Iran. Any one of dozens of pro-Iran Shia militias in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria or Yemen, or any terrorist group or individual wishing to make trouble, potentially has the power to provoke direct US-Iran armed confrontation by attacking “US interests and allies” anywhere at all.Relentless, seemingly implacable American hostility is producing an inevitable reaction inside Iran where, for many, the US-Iran war of 2019 has already begun. The military encirclement is tightening. The country is being strangled economically. Ordinary people face growing hardship. Emboldened regional enemies are queuing up to strike. And it seems nothing will silence Washington’s war drums.That, at least, is how Iranian hardliners, including the powerful clerical establishment, the judiciary, conservative media outlets and Revolutionary Guard commanders, increasingly appear to view the present crisis. Their influence is growing as the inability of Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s moderate president, and his allies to fend off US pressure becomes more evident.Defiant Iranian rhetoric is flying hard and fast. Scorning America’s “gun to the head”, the Revolutionary Guards general Saleh Jokar warned last week that Iran could “easily” strike US navy ships in the Gulf. But his assertion that the US “cannot afford the costs of a new war” smacked of dangerously delusional thinking. Saddam made a similar mistake.Rouhani’s policy of “strategic patience” is now widely dismissed as a failure. Bending to his critics this month, he said Iran would cease to observe some of the terms of the 2015 deal. At the same time, he urged European countries that still support the agreement to do more to circumvent US sanctions. He received short shrift from France and Britain, while at home his move was dismissed as “minimal”.Rouhani’s second term has two years to run, but he is plainly in trouble. His recent call to the public to prepare for sacrifices even greater than those during Iran’s 1980s war with Iraq did not go down well. Internal repression, arbitrary arrests and censorship of social media, which he once vowed to eliminate, are increasing. Hopes of democratic reform that blossomed in the 2009 “Persian spring” have faded.US-Iran enmity is by no means new. It dates back to the 1979 revolution that overthrew the Shah, a western ally, and the subsequent, prolonged hostage siege at the US embassy in Tehran. Some Iranians believe the US has never forgiven that humiliation and has sought revenge ever since. That is given as a reason why Washington backed Saddam, and sold him weapons, during the Iran-Iraq war. Others say it is majority-Shia Iran’s emergence as a regional power that enrages the Americans and Trump’s allies, the Sunni Muslim patriarchs of Saudi Arabia.In one sense, modern Iran is following a well worn path as its strength grows, extending its reach and influence in much the same way as 19th-century America. The chaotic aftermath of the Iraq invasion helped expand its grip. But many in the Sunni Arab world decry Iran’s advance as malign, while Washington has never taken kindly to those who challenge its global prerogatives.Iran’s role, with Russia and Hezbollah in Lebanon, in rescuing Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite regime in Syria is nothing to be proud of. Many atrocities and much suffering can be laid at its door. Iran’s hand is also seen in the fight between Houthi rebels, the Saudis and the UAE in Yemen. Bahrain, among others, accuses Tehran of stirring up trouble with its Shia majority. In all these cases, in fact, the Shia-Sunni divide is an important factor.Most of all, Iran’s growing regional power is seen by the US as a direct threat to Israel. Leading Iranian political and military figures, notably the former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, have repeatedly threatened to wipe the country off the map. Iran is building military bases in Syria, within close missile range. And Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister and Trump buddy, remains convinced the mullahs, despite denials, are hell-bent on acquiring nuclear weapons.In short, America does not lack for reasons to fear Iran. But does that justify the use of military force? Like Iraq in 2003, all the ingredients for war are again present in 2019: old grudges, new weapons, dodgy intelligence, personal animus, opposing ideologies, regional, territorial and religious rivalries, and competition for resources, particularly oil.Optimists say both sides are posturing, that it is a war of nerves, not missiles, and that all-out conflict is unlikely. Pessimists say battle has already been joined on multiple fronts and will surely escalate.Strangely, given his record, Trump could be the person to stop the dread descent to war. Though he does not give a fig about democratic self-determination or human rights, he would like to see a pro-western government in Tehran. His Israeli and Saudi allies desperately want to de-fang Iran and he insists he will defend US interests. He has surrounded himself with hawks and headbangers. On both sides the potential for miscalculation – of war by accident – is massive.Yet Trump says he does not want a fight and has offered to talk to Iran’s leaders, possibly using Swiss intermediaries. He has consistently criticised unpopular and expensive armed interventions in the Middle East. His gut instinct is to fight America’s battles by all means other than military. He would be loath to launch another war as US election year approaches.As is often the case with this president, confusion reigns over what he really wants. Is this confrontation about permanently stifling Iranian nuclear ambitions? Ending its missile programme? Curbing its regional influence? Or all-out, forcible regime change? Amid myriad, alarming uncertainties, perhaps the biggest question now is: which way will Trump jump?Recent attacks on Saudi oil tankers and allegedly heightened threats to US forces in Iraq and Syria are blamed by Washington on Iranian “proxy forces”, a reference to regionally based Shia militias owing allegiance to Tehran.Iraq The Quds Force, a branch of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, supposedly controls up to 140,000 Shia fighters.Syria Iran has reportedly deployed Quds Force units to support the Assad regime and confront Israel.Lebanon Iran’s clerics and Qassem Suleimani, the Quds Force commander, have close links to Hezbollah, Lebanon’s most powerful anti-Israel military organisation.Yemen The insurrectionary Ansar Allah, better known as the Houthis, is the dominant force fighting Iran’s enemy, Saudi Arabia. Iran denies arming the group.Gaza Iran backs Palestinian Islamic Jihad in its struggle against what Tehran terms the “Zionist enemy”.","Old grudges, new weapons… is the US on the brink of war with

"Iranian missiles could easily hit US ships in the Gulf, and any conflict would threaten global energy supplies, a senior Iranian military official has said.As tensions simmered on Friday, Tehran blamed the US for an escalating regional crisis that western intelligence officials fear could lead to open conflict.“If a war happens, the world’s energy supply will suffer,” Gen Saleh Jokar, deputy commander of the Revolutionary Guards, said on Friday. He added: “Iran’s short-range missiles can easily reach present [US] warships in the Persian Gulf.”Iranian military leaders say the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” approach, which includes crippling sanctions on Tehran’s economy and a unilateral pullout from a nuclear deal, has forced an inevitable reaction.On Thursday Maj Gen Hossein Salami, commander of the Revolutionary Guards and the country’s overall military leader, said the two countries were on the verge of a full-scale confrontation. “This is the most decisive moment for the Islamic revolution because the enemy has come to the battlefield with all of its capacities at its disposal,” he told a meeting of subordinates.The economic stranglehold in particular is causing hardship inside Iran and squeezing its ability to sustain a regional proxy network that has been an essential pillar of its foreign policy projection. Before the latest flare-up, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said parts of the country were facing the most severe shortages since the height of the Iran-Iraq war.The Guardian reported on Thursday that Iran’s most prominent general, Qassem Suleimani, had recently called a meeting in Baghdad in which he told Iranian-backed Iraqi militias to “prepare for proxy war”. Intelligence sources have said regional affiliates were “effectively sent to battle stations”.“This wasn’t just in Iraq,” one official said. “The rest of their friends were told to wait for instructions. So far that hasn’t happened to the Iraqi proxies, and there’s a lot of effort going into ensuring that it doesn’t.”Tensions have remained high since last Sunday when four ships, including two Saudi oil tankers, were hulled off the UAE coast. The UK and US believe Iran was ultimately behind the ships’ sabotage. The following day, Iranian-allied rebels in Yemen used drones to attack two Saudi pipelines.Intelligence agencies have been monitoring the activities of the Quds force for an extended period to calibrate the extent of their influence on friendly militias operating in Iraq and Syria, with the focus intensifying in recent weeks as the Iran nuclear deal has unravelled.British sources said the key was to ensure that “no miscalculation” was made in response to the developments in the region, and that the threat was neither under- nor overrated at a time when some voices are pushing for an escalation of US sanctions or even military action against Iran.On Thursday Saudi state media called for “surgical strikes” against Iranian targets in response to the attack on the oil tankers. One intelligence official who spoke to the Guardian said the Saudis had specifically asked Washington whether it would act to defend their interests.Britain has been eager to demonstrate it is acting in step with the US since a disastrous Pentagon briefing this week by a senior British officer who unexpectedly claimed there was “no increased threat” from Iranian forces in Iraq and Syria.The UK has rowed back since, raising the threat level for its forces in the region. On Thursday the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the UK “shared the same assessment” of the threat as the Americans, and on Friday the Foreign Office advised against any travel to Iran by British-Iranian dual nationals.The US and Iran have been engaged in a proxy war for much of the past 15 years, since shortly after the invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein and empowered Iraq’s majority Shias. Militia groups organised under Suleimani’s tutelage evolved into a formidable threat to US forces before the 2011 troop withdrawal. The Pentagon assessed at the time that Shia special groups were responsible for roughly 25% of US battle casualties.When the war against Isis erupted, the US and Iran fought on the same side at times, with the US air force providing air cover to Shia units operating alongside the Iraqi military in central Iraq and Fallujah.The detente coincided with Barack Obama’s outreach to Iran, which led to the nuclear deal. The pivot towards Iran came at the expense of Washington’s long-term relationship with Saudi Arabia, which for nearly 40 years had backed a form of Islam that had widely been seen to have underwritten Sunni extremism.Since the US withdrawal from Iraq, Iran has consolidated its influence among the country’s political class. The Syrian civil war and its spinoffs have given Tehran a new platform on Israel’s doorstep. Iranian moves to entrench military interests in western Syria have been central to the Trump administration’s renewed hostility.Traditional US allies in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have long viewed the Iranian leadership as subversive threats in the Sunni Arab world and believe the Obama outreach gave impetus to Iranian expansionism at the expense of existing partnerships.Additional reporting:

"In November 2018, Donald Trump tweeted: “Oil prices getting lower … a tax cut for America and the world! Enjoy! $54 … Thank you to Saudi Arabia.”Five months on, with oil prices more than $70, Trump will be in a less celebratory mood as Opec’s oil ministers and their allies gather in Jeddah on Friday, without Iran. The main agenda item will be the implications for oil of three interconnected American foreign policy crises – in Venezuela, Iran, and Libya. Together these crises, being played out simultaneously, have the potential to scrub as much as 3.5m barrels of oil per day from the markets.Rarely has there been a moment when a US foreign policy has had so much potential to cause such dislocation to oil markets, and as a result to hand so much market power to America’s Gulf allies to exploit that belligerence.The energy ministers will be in the enviable position of being able to survey both projected rising oil demand for the remainder of the year, just as US foreign policy forces a contraction in supply.The prospect is that the price of oil – which has already risen by 40% this year to more than $72 a barrel – could go much higher.Founded in 1960, the cartel of the world’s biggest oil producers emerged as a political and economic force with the 1973-74 US oil embargo, which caused oil prices to spike. The club consists of 13 countries, with Saudi Arabia the biggest producer, followed by Iraq and Iran.In response to the 2014-16 oil price slump, Opec partnered with Russia in December 2016 to agree a cut in production of 1.8m barrels a day. That curb, the first of its kind in 15 years, drove up the price of oil. In May 2017, the cuts were extended until the end of March 2018. Opec's official members are: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Indonesia and Qatar's membership has lapsed.The Opec+ group, sometimes known as ‘Vienna Group’, adds 10 non-member nations, including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan. Between them these nations supply 55 percent of oil production and hold 90 percent of the planet's oil reserves.For Saudi Arabia, needing an oil price greater than $80 a barrel (and in the range of $85–$87 for the current year) in order to balance its budget, this is a welcome gift.That the countries cheering on the Republican hawks stand most to benefit through higher oil prices is not lost on oil producers in the firing line of US foreign policy, notably Libya and Iran.Indeed, the risks to the oil market, and the world economy, of three simultaneous disruptions to the oil market have become a lobbying point for the Iranians and Libyans as they urge Europe to challenge US policy.Among the three oil-producing countries facing American pressure, it is Iran that is finding its oil exports most curtailed by US actions.Iranian oil production at its peak had reached 3.83m barrels a day in 2017 and is now down well below 2.5m. By unexpectedly ending all sanctions waivers on Iranian oil exports, the US last month signalled it wanted to drive Iranian exports towards zero. Iran has so far unsuccessfully lobbied a reluctant India and China, the two largest importers of Iranian oil, to risk US sanctions and continue buying. The same applies to Turkey.There have been reports that Iran thinks it could survive with exports at 1.5m bpd, but the IEA projected this week that by the summer sales are likely to tumble to below 0.7m bpd, the lowest since the Iran-Iraq war in the 80s and a figure that would put the Iran nuclear deal in jeopardy.In Venezuela, production peaked at about 2.60m bpd in early 2012 but has steadily crumbled to 0.80m due to US sanctions, mainly imposed from August 2017, long-term mismanagement, and more recently power blackouts. There is no sign that the US will lift the sanctions so long as the disputed President Nicolás Maduro clings, with Russia’s support, to power.In Libya, the National Oil Corporation had plans to boost production up to 1.4m bpd by the end of the year, but that looks optimistic in light of Gen Haftar’s attack on Tripoli. That attack has been unchallenged by Trump reportedly following lobbying in Haftar’s favour by Saudi Arabia.Production is currently 1.17m bpd, and most oilfields are in the control of Haftar’s forces but are deeply vulnerable to attacks. Mistratan forces, opposed to Haftar, can readily use the coastal road to reach the Libyan oil crescent facilities that produce 585,000 bpd.Mustafa Sanalla, the chairman of the Libyan National Oil Corporation, one of the few truly national institutions in the country, said: “I cannot foresee any scenario, other than an immediate ceasefire, in which Libya’s oil exports are not severely impacted by the conflict.” So the cumulative impact of the three American interventions, or in the case of Libya’s non-intervention, is that the markets could be deprived of as much 3.5m bpd.The question is just how Saudi Arabia chooses to benefit from the US policy they have advocated, for instance either by stepping in to supply former Iranian customers or instead profiting by letting prices rise. It is possible they will try both. So far the Saudis have resisted a call by Trump to raise production, saying inventories are strong enough.In Asian markets, Saudi Aramco’s state-owned oil giant has already raised its official selling price for June cargoes of its flagship Arab Light crude to the biggest premium versus Middle East benchmark prices in 11 months. The cost of the Arab Medium variety was set at the highest since December 2013, while Arab Heavy was increased to the most in over six years.But the Saudis know Trump’s multiplying crises cannot become a brazen personal bonanza. The Saudi royal family gave undertakings that sanctions against Iran will not lead to oil shortages and, by June, its energy ministers will be under pressure from Trump to boost production. A massive oil price shock this autumn would simply drive US consumers to shale markets, renewables and the Democrats.As one British minister said this week, “the risk of this proving unmanageable and blowing up in our faces is growing”. In an index of the current volatility, oil prices rose by more than 1% on Tuesday when Saudi Arabia claimed explosive-laden drones launched by a Yemeni-armed movement aligned to Iran had attacked pipelines belonging to the state oil company Aramco. Withdrawal of US diplomats from Iraq led to another spike.Similarly, the still-unexplained acts of sabotage on commercial and civilian ships near the territorial waters of the United Arab Emirates at the weekend spooked markets, and revived memories of the tanker wars of the 1980s.Even if Iran was not directly implicated in the attacks, it has awakened the periodic fear that Tehran would seek to close the Strait of Hormuz, the two-mile-wide shipping lane through which a fifth of oil production passes from the Gulf to wider markets. Push Iran too far, and it may not just be the nuclear agreement that gets shut down.Energy markets are not a zero-sum game in which everything turns on Saudi decisions. There are many moving and opposing parts. But it is striking, and possibly unwise, how much Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton’s choice of foreign policy battlegrounds has conspired to make the US so dependent on its Gulf allies, and how much those allies stand to benefit.",Soaring oil prices cast shadow on US ahead of Opec meeting,2019-05-17/13:33:29,in november  donald trump tweeted oil prices getting lower a tax cut for

"Iran’s most prominent military leader has recently met Iraqi militias in Baghdad and told them to “prepare for proxy war”, the Guardian has learned.Two senior intelligence sources said that Qassem Suleimani, leader of Iran’s powerful Quds force, summoned the militias under Tehran’s influence three weeks ago, amid a heightened state of tension in the region. The move to mobilise Iran’s regional allies is understood to have triggered fears in the US that Washington’s interests in the Middle East are facing a pressing threat. The UK raised its threat levels for British troops in Iraq on Thursday.While Suleimani has met regularly with leaders of Iraq’s myriad Shia groups over the past five years, the nature and tone of this gathering was different. “It wasn’t quite a call to arms, but it wasn’t far off,” one source said.The meeting has led to a frenzy of diplomatic activity between US, British and Iraqi officials who are trying to banish the spectre of clashes between Tehran and Washington and who now fear that Iraq could become an arena for conflict.The gathering partly informed a US decision to evacuate non-essential diplomatic staff from the US embassy in Baghdad and Erbil and to raise the threat status at US bases in Iraq. It also coincided with a perceived separate risk to US interests and those of its allies in the Persian Gulf and led to a heightened threat that more than a decade of proxy conflicts may spill over into a direct clash between Washington and Tehran.Leaders of all the militia groups that fall under the umbrella of Iraq’s Popular Mobilisation Units (PMUs) were in attendance at the meeting called by Suleimani, the intelligence sources claimed. One senior figure who learned about the meeting had since met with western officials to express concerns.As the head of the elite Quds force, Suleimani plays a significant role in the militias’ strategic directions and major operations. Over the past 15 years, he has been Iran’s most influential powerbroker in Iraq and Syria, leading Tehran’s efforts to consolidate its presence in both countries and trying to reshape the region in its favour.The US has become increasingly vocal about the activities of Iranian proxies in the Middle East. Donald Trump this month named Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a western-designated terrorist group financed by Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, as partly responsible for a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza into Israel.On Sunday, four ships – two of them Saudi oil tankers – were reportedly sabotaged off the UAE coast. The following day, drones launched by Iranian-allied rebels in Yemen attacked two Saudi pipelines. Saudi state media on Thursday called for “surgical strikes” against Iranian targets in response and its senior officials have told Washington that they expect it to act in its interests.Adding to concerns is a belief that a convoy of Iranian-supplied missiles was last week successfully transported across Iraq’s Anbar province into Syria, where it was transferred safely to Damascus, regional diplomats told the Guardian. The transfer managed to evade US and Israeli intelligence, despite the latter’s interdiction of dozens of alleged missile deliveries in the past three years that have been flown into various Syrian airbases via an airbridge.Fears of an Iranian-run land corridor emerging from the fight against the Islamic State, in which Shia militia groups played a prominent role, have been central to concerns that postwar Iraq and Syria could be subverted by regional manoeuvrings.That Iran could emerge emboldened from the Isis fight has dominated recent discussions among Donald Trump’s uber-hawks, the national security adviser, John Bolton, and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, both of whom are central to an escalating US sanctions programme and Washington’s abandonment of an international nuclear deal signed by Tehran and the former US president Barack Obama.The Trump administration has remained wary of the Iraqi militias. Although they jointly led the fight against Isis, such groups were integrated into the Iraqi state structure, and have drawn increasing comparisons with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps. While they include some Sunni, Christian and Yazidi units, they are dominated by Shia groups, the most powerful of whom enjoy the direct patronage of Iran.The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, appeared to align the UK on Thursday with US claims that Tehran’s threat posture had changed. “We share the same assessment of the heightened threat posed by Iran,” he said on Twitter. “As always we work closely with the USA.”Earlier this week, a British general challenged the Trump administration’s claims that an imminent threat had emerged from Iran, creating a rare public schism between the two countries whose alliance has at times been tested by the erratic nature of Trump’s regional policy.The UK, though, is understood to have been central to the recent concerns being raised, and efforts to de-escalate a crisis in which the US has imposed a “maximum pressure” strategy on Iran and Iranian officials have vowed to defend their interests, in the face of hardline sanctions and an oil blockade that is biting deep into Tehran’s coffers.Tehran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Majid Takht-e Ravanchi, told US broadcaster NPR that Iran was not interested in escalating regional tensions but had the “right to defend ourselves.”The US has ordered a naval battle group and a squadron of B-52 bombers to the region, in response to the perceived increased threat. In Yemen, meanwhile, where a Saudi-led war against Iranian-allied Houthi forces is into its fifth year, early-morning airstrikes killed six people, including four children, a health ministry official

"Britain raised the threat level for its forces in Iraq and the Gulf on Thursday, as the UK repaired a breach with the United States which had erupted earlier this week after a British general had contradicted claims made by the Trump administration.The heightened state of alert covers 400 forces personnel in Iraq, who provide training and support in the country, as well as soldiers and their families based in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar.Jeremy Hunt, the UK foreign secretary, declared that he and his US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, now shared “the same assessment of the heightened threat posed by Iran. As always we work closely with the US.”Earlier this month, the US had accused Iranian regime forces of being engaged in “provocation” in Iraq and Syria, and used that to justify the sending of an aircraft carrier and a bomber taskforce to the Middle East.But this week, the leading British general in the coalition against Isis had unexpectedly disagreed with the American assessment of the military threat in the region, earning him a rare rebuke from the US.Maj Gen Christopher Ghika, a deputy commander of Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), had told a Pentagon briefing that there was “no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria”.US central command, which covers the Middle East and Afghanistan, put out a statement which made clear its disagreement shortly after the briefing. “Recent comments from OIR’s deputy commander run counter to the identified credible threats available to intelligence from US and allies regarding Iranian-backed forces in the region,” it said.But on Thursday, the MoD indicated that its assessment had changed. A spokesman would not comment on the threat level specifically but added: “We keep the security of our deployed personnel and assets under constant review.”The spokesman continued: “There is a range of threats to UK and coalition forces in this part of the world: that is why we have a very robust range of force protection measures. The UK has long been clear about our concerns over Iran’s destabilising behaviour in the region.”In the past week, the UK has also reviewed its naval deployment in the region as tensions have risen. A type 23 frigate, four minesweepers and a floating bases are already stationed in Bahrain.Royal Navy forces participate in various bilateral operations as part of the US Fifth Fleet in the Gulf, as well as in a 27 country coalition whose activities engaged largely in anti-piracy measures off the coast of Somalia.Separately, Iran’s foreign minister said sanctions imposed by the Trump administration are “unacceptable” but added that his country is committed to an international nuclear deal that has steadily unraveled amid rising tensions.On a visit to Tokyo, Mohammad Zarif defended Iran’s right to respond to the US pullout from the nuclear deal last year and ensuing imposition of sanctions by the Trump administration.“We believe that escalation by the United States is unacceptable and uncalled for. We have exercised maximum restraints,” he said. In other comments carried on the semi-official Mehr news agency, Zarif was quoted as saying “a multilateral deal cannot be treated unilaterally”.Four commercial ships were targets of a sabotage attack off the coast of the UAE on Sunday, east of the emirate of Fujairah. Anwar Gargash, the country’s foreign minister, said on Thursday that it expected to complete investigations what happened to the ships within the next two days.“Iran should be aware that it is principally responsible for the instability in the region,” Gargash added and demanded that any future nuclear deal had to involve Arab states like his own. “There must be an Arab role in any framework of future agreement with Iran.”Last May, the Trump administration pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal agreed in 2015 and subsequently reinstated sanctions against the country. Earlier this month, Iran responded by threatened to reduce compliance and increase uranium enrichment, prompting the US to step up its response.Arab News, a Saudi-owned newspaper, has published an editorial calling for a surgical strike on Iran.",UK raises threat level for British forces in Iraq and Gulf,2019-05-16/19:05:22,britain raised the threat level for its forces in iraq and the gulf on thursday as the uk repaired a breach with the united states which had erupted earlier this week after a british general had contradicted claims made by the trump administration the heightened state of alert covers  forces personnel in iraq who provide training and support in the country as well as soldiers and their families based in saudi arabia kuwait and qatar jeremy hunt the uk foreign secretary declared that he and his us secretary of state mike pompeo now shared the same assessment of the heightened threat posed by iran as always we work closely with the us earlier this month the us had accused iranian regime forces of being engaged in provocation in iraq and syria and used that to justify the sending of an aircraft carrier and a bomber taskforce to the middle east but this week the leading british general in the coalition against isis had unexpectedly disagreed with the american assessment of the military threat in the region earning him a rare rebuke from the us maj gen christopher ghika a deputy commander of operation inherent resolve oir had told a pentagon briefing that there was no increased threat from iranian backed forces in iraq and syria us central command which covers the middle east and afghanistan put out a statement which made clear its disagreement shortly after the briefing recent comments from oir s deputy commander run counter to the identified credible threats available to intelligence from us and allies regarding iranian backed forces in the region it said but on thursday the mod indicated that its assessment had changed a spokesman would not comment on the threat level specifically but added we keep the security of our deployed personnel and assets under constant review the spokesman continued there is a range of threats to uk and coalition forces in this part of the world that is why we have a very robust range of force protection measures the uk has long been clear about our concerns over iran s destabilising behaviour in the region in the past week the uk has also reviewed its naval deployment in the region as tensions have risen a type  frigate four minesweepers and a floating bases are already stationed in bahrain royal navy forces participate in various bilateral operations as part of the us fifth fleet in the gulf as well as in a  country coalition whose activities engaged largely in anti piracy measures off the coast of somalia separately iran s foreign minister said sanctions imposed by the trump administration are unacceptable but added that his country is committed to an international nuclear deal that has steadily unraveled amid rising tensions on a visit to tokyo mohammad zarif defended iran s right to respond to the us pullout from the nuclear deal last year and ensuing imposition of sanctions by the trump administration we believe that escalation by the united states is unacceptable and uncalled for we have exercised maximum restraints he said in other comments carried on the semi official mehr news agency zarif was quoted as saying a multilateral deal cannot be treated unilaterally four commercial ships were targets of a sabotage attack off the coast of the uae on sunday east of the emirate of fujairah anwar gargash the country s foreign minister said on thursday that it expected to complete investigations what happened to the ships within the next two days iran should be aware that it is principally responsible for the instability in the region gargash added and demanded that any future nuclear deal had to involve arab states like his own there must be an arab role in any framework of future agreement with iran last may the trump administration pulled out of the iran nuclear deal agreed in  and subsequently reinstated sanctions against the country earlier this month iran responded by threatened to reduce compliance and increase uranium enrichment prompting the us to step up its response arab news a saudi owned newspaper has published an editorial calling for a surgical strike on iran ,Iran Sanctions,0.425694019
"WASHINGTON   - The White House is warning Chinese shipping companies against turning off their ships’ transponders to hide Iranian oil shipments in violation of U.S. sanctions, two senior administration officials said. “We’ve been messaging very heavily to the shipping companies, you don’t want to do this, it’s not worth it,” said  one official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. “It’s incredibly dangerous and irresponsible behavior.”  China is the largest remaining buyer of Iranian oil after U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions on Tehran’s main export. Trump tightened U.S. sanctions in May in an effort to drive Iran’s oil sales to zero. The sanctions are aimed at quashing Iran’s nuclear ambitions, ballistic missile program and influence in Syria, Iraq and other countries. Its oil exports have fallen to less than 400,000 barrels per day from about 2.5 million bpd.  On Sept. 25, the U.S. imposed sanctions on five Chinese individuals and two Chinese COSCO Shipping Corp subsidiaries, saying they had shipped Iranian crude oil in violation of the sanctions.   Days later, 14 COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) vessels, about one-third of its fleet, stopped sending location data from their automatic identification system (AIS) between Sept. 30 and Oct. 7, ship tracking data on Refinitiv Eikon showed. The administration said on Tuesday it had independently confirmed that COSCO had been shutting off AIS on its ships. All but three of the ships have become traceable since Reuters’ report ran on Oct. 9. The latest locations for Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) Yuan Shan Hu and Cosglad Lake were still unavailable between Oct. 8 and Oct. 16, while Aframax-sized tanker Yang Mei Hu has been untraceable since Oct. 11, data showed. COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) said in an e-mail statement that none of its vessels had turned off their AIS controllers or stopped transmitting AIS signals. “Dalian Tanker will continue to adhere to applicable laws and regulations in the conduct of its business operations,” the company said. The International Maritime Organization requires vessels to use transponders for safety and transparency. Crews can turn off the devices if there is a danger of piracy or similar hazards. But transponders are often shut off to conceal a ship’s location during illicit activities. It was not clear what the Trump administration could do to stop the tankers from turning off transponders.  It has warned shipping companies, energy companies and port officials to be wary of trade in Iranian oil, in some cases telling them they could face sanctions for doing so.   The administration believes that sanctions are on the verge of causing an economic depression in Iran, one of the officials said. But Iran has years of experience dealing with sanctions. Some analysts believe Tehran may be attempting to ride out the economic pain until the November 2020 U.S. presidential election, hoping Trump will lose and the next president will take a softer line on Tehran. “If they calculate that there is going to be (a new president) and they are incorrect, that’s bad,” the second official said. “Because I don’t think anybody thinks that they could make it another four years after next November under this kind of sanctions regime.” The Trump administration is watching illegal shipments even if it is not able to stop them, the second official said. “We are literally going ship by ship at this point because each ship is incredibly important” to Iran’s economy, the second official said. Trump wants initial talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, without preconditions, to see whether there is a chance for a deal to ease tensions between the two countries, one official said. The two leaders did not meet at last month’s U.N. General Assembly gathering.  The United States said on Friday it was sending about 3,000 additional American military personnel to Saudi Arabia to bolster defenses after attacks on oil facilities last month, which were widely blamed on Iran. Tehran denies any role.

"NEW YORK   - Oil prices fell on Friday and posted a weekly loss on a faster-than-expected recovery in Saudi output, while investors also worried about global crude demand amid slowing Chinese economic growth. During a volatile session, Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 83 cents, or 1.3%, to settle at $61.91 a barrel, after dropping to a session low of $60.76 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 50 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $55.91 a barrel. It hit a session low of $54.75 a barrel. Brent fell 3.7% for the week, its biggest weekly loss since early August. WTI lost 3.6%, its steepest loss since mid-July. Crude futures fell along with other higher-risk assets after news the U.S. government is considering the possibility of delisting Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges, a source briefed on the matter said on Friday. The move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Earlier in the session, futures fell after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the United States offered to remove all sanctions on Iran in exchange for talks. However, U.S. President Donald Trump then said he had refused the request by Tehran. “We’ve really been following headline to headline,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst with Price Futures Group in Chicago. Also weighing on prices, a Wall Street Journal report citing unnamed sources said Saudi Arabia had agreed a partial ceasefire in Yemen, said analysts in the Reuters Global Oil Forum. “Saudi Arabia has occupied center stage in prompting a major upswing in oil price volatility through most of this month both on a daily and weekly basis,” Jim Ritterbusch, of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Brent is just above its level before attacks on Saudi facilities on Sept. 14, which initially halved the kingdom’s production. Sources told Reuters this week that Saudi Arabia had restored capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day. Saudi Aramco has yet to confirm it is fully back online. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said it might cut its estimates for global oil demand for 2019 and 2020 should the global economy weaken further. In China, the world’s second-largest economy and biggest importer of crude oil, industrial companies reported a contraction in profits in August.  Key oil freight rates from the Middle East to Asia rocketed as much as 28% on Friday in the global oil shipping market, spooked by U.S. sanctions on units of China’s COSCO for alleged involvement in ferrying crude out of Iran. The COSCO vessels account for about 7.5% of the world’s fleet of supertankers, Refinitiv data showed. Emerging details related to the Trump impeachment inquiry also helped to dent demand sentiment, analysts said.  “An impeachment would add to the uncertainty of the U.S. economy,” Flynn said. In an indication of future production, U.S. energy firms reduced the number of oil rigs this week, and for a record 10th month in a row. Drillers cut six oil rigs in the week to Sept. 27, bringing the total count down to 713, the lowest since May 2017, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Sept. 24 by 8,199 contracts to 212,561, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.

"SEOUL   - North Korea is evading U.N. sanctions to cash in on soaring domestic demand for smartphones, using low-cost hardware imports to generate significant income for the regime, according to defectors, experts and an analysis of North Korean-made phones.  Economists estimate as many as six million North Koreans - a quarter of the population - now have mobile phones, a critical tool for participating in an informal market economy that has become a key income source for many. Reuters spoke to some 10 defectors and experts about the use of mobile devices in North Korea, as well as reviewing state media reports and advertisements for mobile devices, and examining two North Korean-branded smartphones.  The phones feature Taiwanese semiconductors, batteries made in China and a version of Google’s open-source Android operating system, analysis of the North Korean phones revealed. United Nations sanctions imposed in 2017 here because of the North's weapons programs prohibit imports of mobile phone hardware.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has endorsed wireless networks, some reportedly built with the help of China’s Huawei Technologies, and local mobile phone brands through public speeches and a tour to a mobile phone factory reported by state media. Basic North Korean phones typically cost between $100 and $400 at state stores or private markets, experts and defectors say. Subscriptions to mobile carriers are registered at the telecom ministry’s stores. Phones are typically sold with service plans that include 200 minutes of calling time. Prepaid plans cost about $13 dollars for 100 minutes, North Korean phone advertisements show.  While those prices are comparable to or higher than what mobile phone customers pay in other countries, North Koreans earn an average of about $100 per month, only about 4% of their southern neighbors, according to South Korean government data.  International brands such as Apple (AAPL.O) iPhones are not publicly on sale, but traders and wealthy North Koreans can buy them outside the country and use them with local SIM cards, defectors say. North Korean phones can only be used to call domestic numbers and have some unique security features.    Downloading or transferring files is severely restricted. Reuters found a warning pop-up when installing an “unidentified program” on the Pyongyang 2418 smartphone stating: “If you install illegal programs, your phone can malfunction or data will get destroyed.” “North Korea puts algorithms and software in its mobile phones to keep data from being copied or transferred,” said Lee Young-hwan, a South Korean software expert studying North Korean smartphones. Apps such as maps, games and an English dictionary show they are developed by North Korean engineers at state-run enterprises or state universities. The regime has also developed a home-grown surveillance tool on mobile phones, according the U.K.-based cybersecurity company Hacker House. When a user accesses illegal or non-state approved media, an alert is generated and stored inside the phone. A modified version of Android also conducts surveillance and tracks users,  Hacker House said.  North Korea’s representatives at the United Nations did not respond to requests for comment. Still, the phones are a big asset in North Korea’s grey market economy, which has flourished since a devastating famine in the 1990s. One young North Korean woman surnamed Choi recalled selling two pigs and smuggling herbs from China to raise the 1,300 Chinese yuan ($183) her family needed to buy a mobile phone in 2013.  She used the phone to help successfully run a retail business selling Chinese clothes and shampoos, arranging deliveries from wholesalers.  “It turned out we could make a way more money than our official salaries,” said Choi, who has since defected to South Korea, declining to give her full name for fear of retribution against relatives still in North Korea. In a survey this year of 126 North Korean defectors who had used mobile phones, more than 90% said cellphones improved their daily lives and about half said they used them for market activities.    “Millions of people are using mobile phones and need them to make a living or show off their wealth,” said Shin Mi-nyeo, executive director of the Organization for One Korea, a South Korean support group for defectors that conducted the poll. “Then their phone bills create huge income for the government.”  Kim Bong-sik, a researcher at South Korea’s Korea Information Society Development Institute, said estimating revenues was difficult, but it was likely to be one of the state’s biggest earners given the scale of the business. SANCTIONS-BUSTING The two Pyongyang-branded smartphones examined by Reuters are powered by chips from Taiwan’s MediaTek (2454.TW) and run a version of Google’s Android operating system, along with the North Korean security software. Ads for an Arirang-branded handset also claimed to use MediaTek chips. The Pyongyang 2423 smartphone manufactured last year featured Mediatek’s MT6737 chipset and a slot for one SIM card and one memory card. The memory card’s serial number showed it was produced by Japanese chip-maker Toshiba (6502.T). The device’s identification number showed the phone was manufactured by the Chinese firm Gionee, a maker of low-end smartphones. Google said any hardware maker can use open-source Android software at no cost, meaning no export rules are being violated in regards to North Korean smartphones. Mediatek said in a statement to Reuters it had not shipped any products to North Korea, and was in full compliance with sanctions. Toshiba also said the company had no business with North Korea. Gionee did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “North Korea cannot make phones without using foreign components and technology,” said Kim, the researcher. “That means it is violating sanctions to keep running the business.”  Official customs data show North Korea imported $82 million worth of mobile phones from China in 2017, the third biggest import item after soybean oil and fabrics.  That number dropped to zero in 2018 as sanctions bit.  But while sanctions eliminated official imports, informal trade along the China-North Korea border appears to be ongoing, experts and defectors say.    William Brown, a retired U.S. intelligence official who studies North Korea said mobile phone hardware parts “are very easily smuggled across the Chinese border.”  Intermediaries make it hard to find those responsible for breaching sanctions, he added.  China is North Korea’s sole major ally, and its mobile phone industry is crowded with little-known local smartphone manufacturers. Chinese officials referred questions to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which declined to comment. China has repeatedly said it upholds U.N. sanctions but has defended what it calls “normal trade” with North Korea. Big Chinese telecommunications brands have previously supplied North Korea as well.  Huawei supplied 3G network equipment to North Korea after late leader Kim Jong Il, the father of Kim Jong Un, toured the Chinese tech giant in 2006, according to U.S. Nautilus Institute and monitoring group 38North. The U.S. Commerce Department has been investigating Huawei since 2016 and is reviewing whether the company violated export control rules in relation to sanctions on North Korea, sources have said. ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) agreed last year to pay a $1 billion fine for violating U.S. sanctions involving shipment of telecom equipment to Iran and North Korea. Huawei and ZTE did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.

"LONDON/NEW YORK   - Refinery outages in Saudi Arabia following weekend attacks on its oil facilities could deal a blow to the shipping industry’s preparations for the biggest switch in fuel standards in decades.  Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil company, shut an estimated 40% of its refining capacity, roughly 1 million barrels per day (bpd), following Saturday’s missile and drone strikes on a major oilfield and the country’s largest processing plant. It remains unclear how long refinery output will be curtailed. The outage has crimped global supplies of diesel, which Saudi Arabia regularly exports in large volumes. The drop in diesel supplies and subsequent sharp rise in diesel refining margins come at a sensitive time for oil traders and shipping firms busy stocking the product before a switch to cleaner marine fuel standards next January. The new rules, aimed at reducing air pollution in seagoing vessels, will require ships globally to use fuels with a sulphur content below 0.5%, down from 3.5% now. The rules, known as IMO 2020, are expected to tighten supplies of distillates, including  diesel.     “The Saudi outages are bad news for IMO preparations,” said Robert Campbell, head of global oil product markets at consultancy Energy Aspects. “We’re losing diesel supplies, at least temporarily, because Saudi Arabia will prioritize restoration of oil exports over refinery output,” he said.  “The question is how long the refineries remain down.” Saudi Arabia exported 1.07 million bpd of gasoil and diesel in June, according to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative, a body that issues energy data using submissions by its members such as Riyadh.  The sharp rise in diesel prices since the attacks has also made storage of the fuel, vital before the switch, less attractive for traders. The attack on the Abqaiq processing plant also hit Saudi Arabia’s supplies of Arab Extra Light crude, a light, sour grade, and Arab Light, a medium sour crude grade.  When processed, both sour grades produce a large proportion of high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO), a cheap and dirty fuel used for ships and power plants, including in Saudi Arabia. Since the attacks, HSFO premiums have hit record highs in Asia. Prices for the fuel had already increased in recent months due to a shortage of sour crudes, largely because of lower exports from Venezuela and Iran resulting from U.S. sanctions. The lower availability of HSFO could have a knock-on effect on IMO preparations as some shippers stick to HSFO even after the switch by using exhaust filters that remove sulphur, said Stephen George, chief economist at energy consultancy KBC. “With an additional 1.5 million bpd of sour residue crudes unavailable, the whole market for the bottom of the barrel becomes tighter and competition will become bigger,” George said.      “The absence of Saudi crude is expected to be a problem in four to six weeks from now. If there is a longer-term impairment to the production of barrels, it could run into the IMO framework and it will take the market some time to sort itself out.” Typical buyers of Arab Light are Asian countries including Japan, South Korea, India and China. They were expected to ramp up buying of light crudes from other countries such as the United States or nations in West Africa.

"PARIS/RIYADH   - An attack on Saudi oil installations that halted half the kingdom’s output could harm French diplomacy meant to avert feared U.S.-Iranian conflict, diplomats said after President Emmanuel Macron’s top envoy held talks in Saudi Arabia. They said France was trying to pinpoint the origin of Saturday’s strike on the oil infrastructure of the world’s top crude exporter as it pursues diplomacy to defuse tensions across the Gulf region.  The United States has blamed Tehran for the attack. Iran has denied responsibility and on Tuesday again ruled out talks with Washington unless it rescinds sanctions and returns to a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that it ditched last year. “Up to now France doesn’t have proof permitting it to say that these drones came from such and such a place, and I don’t know if anyone has proof,” Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters during a visit to Cairo on Tuesday. “We need a strategy of de-escalation for the area, and any move that goes against this de-escalation would be a bad move for the situation in the region,” he said. Macron spent the summer trying to damp down an intensifying crisis between Washington and Tehran, and the attack on Saudi oil facilities has placed him in an awkward with Saudi Arabia, a pivotal regional ally. Three diplomats said Emmanuel Bonne, a Middle East expert who has steered Macron’s diplomacy, met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in Jeddah on Monday. The trip had been scheduled before the weekend attacks.   Macron’s office declined comment.  With Macron’s diplomatic push at stake and the fate of the international nuclear pact with Iran uncertain, France wants to compile an independent assessment of the attack, including the original launch location and the exact weapons used. U.S. officials said Iranian arms were used, but given no proof. “We have some elements on the attack that are not ours that we are studying, but we want to check with our own sources and it takes time,” a French diplomatic source said on Tuesday. “The attack doesn’t help what we are trying to do, but before we leap into the blame game, we need something concrete.” Macron sent Bonne to meet senior Iranian officials during the summer and tried to use his personal rapport with U.S. President Donald Trump to open talks between the two sides. European leaders have struggled to quell the confrontation between Tehran and Washington since Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal, which promised Iran access to world trade and investment in return for curbs on its disputed nuclear activity. At a G7 summit in France last month, Trump suggested a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani could happen within weeks, which would mark a diplomatic coup for Macron.  But Trump and Rouhani have since played down that possibility. Iran has retreated from full compliance with the deal since the U.S. pullout, exceeding limits on uranium enrichment. To reverse Iran’s retaliatory moves and launch broader talks covering its ballistic missiles and regional behavior, as Trump demands, Macron has suggested a multi-billion-dollar credit line to enable Tehran to ease an economic crisis wrought by U.S. sanctions that have decimated Iran’s vital oil trade. But that hinges on some U.S. flexibility in applying sanctions including waivers for European allies buying Iranian oil. Washington has shown no signs of backing down.  “When both sides don’t want to play ball there’s only so much we can do,” said a second French diplomat.

"SINGAPORE/WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to extend a reprieve given to Huawei Technologies that permits the Chinese firm to buy supplies from U.S. companies so that it can service existing customers, two sources familiar with the situation said. The “temporary general license” will be extended for Huawei for 90 days, the sources said.  Commerce initially allowed Huawei to purchase some American-made goods in May shortly after blacklisting the company in a move aimed at minimizing disruption for its customers, many of which operate networks in rural America. An extension will renew an agreement set to lapse on August 19, continuing the Chinese company’s ability to maintain existing telecommunications networks and provide software updates to Huawei handsets. The situation surrounding the license, which has become a key bargaining chip for the United States in its trade negotiations with China, remains fluid and the decision to continue the Huawei reprieve could change ahead of the Monday deadline, the sources said. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to discuss Huawei in a call this weekend, one of the sources said. Huawei did not have an immediate comment. China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. When the Commerce Department blocked Huawei from buying U.S. goods earlier this year, it was seen as a major escalation in the trade war between the world’s two top economies. The U.S. government blacklisted Huawei alleging the Chinese company is involved in activities contrary to national security or foreign policy interests. As an example, the blacklisting order cited a criminal case pending against the company in federal court, over allegations Huawei violated U.S. sanctions against Iran. Huawei has pleaded not guilty in the case. The order noted that the indictment also accused Huawei of “deceptive and obstructive acts”.             At the same time the United States says Huawei’s smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans, allegations the company has repeatedly denied. The world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker is still prohibited from buying American parts and components to manufacture new products without additional special licenses. Many Huawei suppliers have requested the special licenses to sell to the firm. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told reporters late last month he had received more than 50 applications, and that he expected to receive more. Out of $70 billion that Huawei spent buying components in 2018, some $11 billion went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm, Intel and Micron Technology. The Commerce Department late on Friday declined to comment, referring to Ross’s comments to CNBC television earlier this week in which he said the existing licenses were in effect until Monday. Asked if they would be extended he said: “On Monday I’ll be happy to update you.” ",Exclusive: U.S. set to give Huawei another 90 days to buy from American suppliers - sources,"August 17, 2019 /  3:25 AM ",singapore washington the u s commerce department is expected to extend a reprieve given to huawei technologies that permits the chinese firm to buy supplies from u s companies so that it can service existing customers two sources familiar with the situation said the temporary general license will be extended for huawei for  days the sources said commerce initially allowed huawei to purchase some american made goods in may shortly after blacklisting the company in a move aimed at minimizing disruption for its customers many of which operate networks in rural america an extension will renew an agreement set to lapse on august  continuing the chinese company s ability to maintain existing telecommunications networks and provide software updates to huawei handsets the situation surrounding the license which has become a key bargaining chip for the united states in its trade negotiations with china remains fluid and the decision to continue the huawei reprieve could change ahead of the monday deadline the sources said u s president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping are expected to discuss huawei in a call this weekend one of the sources said huawei did not have an immediate comment china s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment when the commerce department blocked huawei from buying u s goods earlier this year it was seen as a major escalation in the trade war between the world s two top economies the u s government blacklisted huawei alleging the chinese company is involved in activities contrary to national security or foreign policy interests as an example the blacklisting order cited a criminal case pending against the company in federal court over allegations huawei violated u s sanctions against iran huawei has pleaded not guilty in the case the order noted that the indictment also accused huawei of deceptive and obstructive acts at the same time the united states says huawei s smartphones and network equipment could be used by china to spy on americans allegations the company has repeatedly denied the world s largest telecommunications equipment maker is still prohibited from buying american parts and components to manufacture new products without additional special licenses many huawei suppliers have requested the special licenses to sell to the firm commerce secretary wilbur ross told reporters late last month he had received more than  applications and that he expected to receive more out of  billion that huawei spent buying components in  some  billion went to u s firms including qualcomm intel and micron technology the commerce department late on friday declined to comment referring to ross s comments to cnbc television earlier this week in which he said the existing licenses were in effect until monday asked if they would be extended he said on monday i ll be happy to update you ,Iran Sanctions,0.218437672

"PARIS   - French carmaker Renault (RENA.PA) posted a 6.7% decline in first-half vehicle sales amid a global auto slowdown, but said a forthcoming product offensive would begin to help soften the blow in key markets. Sales fell to 1.94 million light vehicles in January-June from 2.08 million a year earlier, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. The slump was outpaced by a 7.1 percent global market contraction, it added. The sales announcement comes amid gathering gloom for the global auto industry, with major markets in decline and trade barriers looming. It also comes a day after domestic rival PSA (PEUP.PA) recorded a 12.8% slump in deliveries. “Renault maintained its market share in the first half of the year in a market that was in sharp decline,” the carmaker said, adding that it had held its ground with “no new products”. The rollout of a new Clio mini will help lift sales in the second half, sales chief Olivier Murguet told reporters, bolstered by an updated Zoe electric car. Global sales of battery-powered models rose 42.9% in the first half. While the core Renault brand’s sales fell 11.5% in the first half, lower-cost brands showed gains, with Dacia up 4.5% and the Russian Lada marque advancing 6.8%. Group sales were flat in a declining European market but down 27.7% in the sales region spanning Africa, the Middle East and India, - largely as a result of Renault’s 2018 withdrawal from Iran under threat of U.S. sanctions. Deliveries fell 5.2 percent in the Eurasia region including Russia, and 3.9% in the Americas, where Renault sees the Brazilian market rebounding 8% this year. The global market will show a new decline of about 3% this year, Renault said, with Russia down a further 2-3% and Europe stable, assuming that a hard Brexit is averted.

"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump said he does not want to listen to an audio recording of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi despite facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia for the killing. Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, and Turkey has given the U.S. government a recording of the murder, but Trump said he would not listen to it “because it’s a suffering tape, it’s a terrible tape.” “I don’t want to hear the tape, no reason for me to hear the tape,” Trump said in an interview with “Fox News Sunday.”  “I know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it ... It was very violent, very vicious and terrible.” Trump also said he wants to maintain a close alliance with Saudi Arabia despite Khashoggi’s death and questioned the alleged role of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is known as MbS and is the kingdom’s de facto ruler. “He told me that he had nothing to do with it,” Trump said, adding that “many people” also said the crown prince had no knowledge of the killing. The interview was taped on Friday, hours before government sources said the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had briefed the Trump administration on the murder and its belief that MbS ordered it. Trump said on Saturday that the CIA assessment was “very premature” and in the interview that aired on Sunday he said it may never be possible to know who ordered Khashoggi’s murder.     Trump faces intense pressure from senior Democratic and Republican lawmakers to take tougher action against Saudi Arabia. Some have said Trump should suspend arms sales to the kingdom and drop his support for MbS, but Trump has so far resisted that pressure. The administration on Thursday imposed economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing, but they did not target the Saudi government. Saudi Arabia is a major oil supplier and a close ally of the United States in countering Iranian power in the Middle East. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump, said on Sunday he had no doubt about MbS’ involvement in ordering the murder of Khashoggi.       “They are an important ally but when it comes to the crown prince, he’s irrational, he’s unhinged and I think he’s done a lot of damage to the relationship (between) the United States and Saudi Arabia. And I have no intention of working with him ever again,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  ",Trump does not want to hear tape of 'vicious' Khashoggi murder,"November 18, 2018 /  4:12 PM ",washington u s president donald trump said he does not want to listen to an audio recording of the murder of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi despite facing mounting pressure to punish saudi arabia for the killing khashoggi was killed inside the saudi consulate in istanbul on oct  and turkey has given the u s government a recording of the murder but trump said he would not listen to it because it s a suffering tape it s a terrible tape i don t want to hear the tape no reason for me to hear the tape trump said in an interview with fox news sunday i know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it it was very violent very vicious and terrible trump also said he wants to maintain a close alliance with saudi arabia despite khashoggi s death and questioned the alleged role of saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman who is known as mbs and is the kingdom s de facto ruler he told me that he had nothing to do with it trump said adding that many people also said the crown prince had no knowledge of the killing the interview was taped on friday hours before government sources said the central intelligence agency cia had briefed the trump administration on the murder and its belief that mbs ordered it trump said on saturday that the cia assessment was very premature and in the interview that aired on sunday he said it may never be possible to know who ordered khashoggi s murder trump faces intense pressure from senior democratic and republican lawmakers to take tougher action against saudi arabia some have said trump should suspend arms sales to the kingdom and drop his support for mbs but trump has so far resisted that pressure the administration on thursday imposed economic sanctions on  saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing but they did not target the saudi government saudi arabia is a major oil supplier and a close ally of the united states in countering iranian power in the middle east republican senator lindsey graham a close ally of trump said on sunday he had no doubt about mbs involvement in ordering the murder of khashoggi they are an important ally but when it comes to the crown prince he s irrational he s unhinged and i think he s done a lot of damage to the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia and i have no intention of working with him ever again he said on nbc s meet the press ,Iran Sanctions,0.220200002
"NEW YORK   - Oil prices fell almost 4% to their lowest in over two months on a smaller-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories and fears of a global economic slowdown due to the U.S.-China trade war. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said U.S. crude stockpiles fell nearly 300,000 barrels last week, less than the 900,000-barrel decline analysts forecast in a Reuters poll and  well below the 5.3 million-barrel drawdown the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported late Wednesday.  The decline last week reduced crude stocks from their highest since July 2017 seen the previous week, but at 476.5 million barrels, they were still about 5% above the five-year average for this time of year. “The oil inventories report has added to the bearish sentiment prevailing in today’s trading session,” said Abhishek Kumar, head of analytics at Interfax Energy in London, noting “Demand-side concerns emerging from the ongoing U.S.-China trade war are expected to remain the key driver weighing on oil prices.” Brent futures fell $2.58, or 3.7%, to settle at $66.87 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropped $2.22, or 3.8%, to close at $56.59. Those were the lowest closes for Brent since March 12 and WTI since March 8. For the month, Brent is on track to fall about 8% and WTI around 11%, which would be the first monthly decline for both contracts in five months. The premium of Brent over WTI , meanwhile, fell to around $10 per barrel, down from a more than four-year high of $11.59 on Wednesday. “An escalating U.S.-China trade war represents a risk to oil markets,” Bernstein Energy said in a note.  A senior Chinese diplomat compared trade actions from Washington to “naked economic terrorism.” Bernstein Energy said under “a full-blown trade war scenario,” global oil demand would grow by just 0.7% this year, half of current estimates. Because of weakening demand, Bernstein said any upside for oil markets was capped despite relatively tight supply. Oil prices have been supported this year by output cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers, as well as by falling supplies from OPEC members Iran and Venezuela due to U.S. sanctions. Iranian May crude exports dropped to less than half of April levels at around 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) after the United States tightened sanctions on Tehran’s main source of income. Iran needs to export at least 1.5-2.0 million bpd of crude to balance its books. “We see an abundance of escalation risks in large part because the U.S. sanctions are subjecting Iran to almost unprecedented economic pain,” said Helima Croft, managing director of RBC Capital Markets.  Arab leaders gather in Saudi Arabia on Thursday for emergency summits that Riyadh hopes will deliver a strong message to Iran that regional powers will defend their interests against any threat following attacks on Gulf oil assets this month. As Arab leaders gathered in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Iran envoy said the United States will respond with military force if its interests are attacked by Iran. Many analysts also expect OPEC-led supply cuts to be extended until the end of 2019 as the group wants to prevent oil prices from falling back to levels seen in late 2018 when Brent slumped to $50 per barrel. Since OPEC and its allies started withholding supply in January, oil prices have risen by about 30%. (GRAPHIC: Iran crude oil shipments link: tmsnrt.rs/2WabNSp).

"NEW YORK   - Oil futures were up more than 1% on Thursday as tensions in the Middle East grew, with a Saudi-led coalition launching air strikes in retaliation for recent attacks on its crude infrastructure. Brent crude futures settled at $72.62 a barrel, up 85 cents, or 1.18%, after touching their highest level in three weeks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled at $62.87 a barrel, gaining 81 cents, or 1.37%, after hitting its strongest level in two weeks. The Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen carried out several air strikes on the Houthi-held capital Sanaa on Thursday after the Iranian-aligned movement claimed responsibility for drone attacks on two Saudi oil pumping stations earlier in the week.  Saudi Arabia’s deputy defense minister accused Iran of ordering the drone attack on the pumping stations. It comes after attacks on four oil tankers off the coast of United Arab Emirates on Sunday.  Taken together, the escalation of tensions has compounded fears of lowered supply in the Middle East. U.S. staff were ordered to leave the American embassy in Baghdad on Wednesday out of concern about perceived threats from Iran.  “These types of tensions are unlike what we’ve seen in a very long time, and I think the market is starting to wake up to the fact that the risks are getting graver,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “When you’ve got shootings at pipelines, you’ve got drone attacks... the odds for some type of conflict, or supply disruption, go up.” Iraq’s oil minister Thamer Ghadhban said Thursday that international oil companies have said they are operating as normal in the country, Iran’s direct neighbor.      Asian shippers and refiners have put ships heading to the Middle East on alert and are expecting a possible rise in marine insurance premiums after the attacks. “Until there’s some kind of stepback from that situation, this market is going to have a tough time trading lower,” said Mizuho director of futures Bob Yawger.  Tight gasoline supplies and a rally in equities also helped to boost crude futures, Yawger said. The market still faces uncertainty over whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers will continue with supply cuts that have boosted prices more than 30% so far this year.

"GENEVA   - U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil industry will damage the stability of global oil markets, a senior Iranian official was quoted as saying on Monday. “These sanctions are an example of America’s bullying reaction in trying to change the balance of power in the world,” Amir Hossein Zamaninia, a deputy oil minister, said in a report carried by the oil ministry’s news website SHANA.  Oil prices hit their highest level since November last week after Washington announced all waivers on imports of sanctions-hit Iranian oil would end this week, pressuring importers to stop buying from Tehran and further tightening global supply. The United States demanded last Monday that buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions, ending six months of waivers which allowed Iran’s eight biggest buyers, most of them in Asia, to continue importing limited volumes. The White House said after its Iran move it was working with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to ensure oil markets were “adequately supplied” but traders worried about tight supplies. Other countries can not fill Iran’s place in the oil market, Zamaninia said, according to SHANA. “This idea that some countries can fill the empty place of Iran’s oil in the market is incorrect from different aspects, including a technical and political view,” Zamaninia said. Separately, Zamaninia said the Gulf can only remain an international route for transferring oil if all countries are able to use it. The commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ navy said last week that Iran would close the strategic Strait of Hormuz if Tehran is barred from using it.

"BEIJING   - China’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it has formally complained to the United States over its decision to end waivers on sanctions on Iranian oil imports, adding another fault line to already complicated Beijing-Washington ties.  China is Iran’s largest crude oil customer, with total imports last year of 29.27 million tonnes, or about 585,400 barrels a day, roughly 6 percent of China’s total oil imports, according to customs data. Washington has announced that all Iran sanction waivers will end by May, causing crude oil prices to rise and pressuring importers to cut their Iranian imports to zero. China was one of eight global buyers that won exemptions to import crude oil last November. China is resolutely opposed to the United States enforcing unilateral sanctions or “long armed jurisdiction”, Geng Shuang, a ministry spokesman, told a daily news briefing.  “The decision from the U.S. will contribute to volatility in the Middle East and in the international energy market. We urge the United States to take a responsible attitude and play a constructive role, not the opposite,” Geng said. “China has already lodged representations with the U.S. side about this.” The “normal” energy cooperation China and other countries have with Iran within the framework of international law is lawful and reasonable, and should be respected, he added. “China urges the U.S. side to earnestly respect China’s interests and concerns and not take any wrong actions that harm China’s interests.” China will continue to work to protect the legitimate rights of Chinese firms, Geng said. Beijing and Tehran have long had close relations, especially in the energy sector.  Some of China’s refineries are configured to process the Iranian crude and refinery officials say Iranian oil typically yields better margins compared similar grades from rival suppliers such as Saudi Arabia.  State-owned Sinopec Group and China National Petroleum Corp both produce oil in Iran, having spent billions of dollars on oil fields such as Yadavaran and North Azadegan. They have been sending the oil from the fields to China. China and the United States are currently working to end a bitter trade war, but have numerous other areas of disagreement, including the South China Sea and U.S. support for self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a wayward province.

"NEW YORK   - Crude oil jumped almost 3% on Monday after the United States said it will take more steps to choke off Iranian oil exports, while U.S. equities were mixed as Wall Street braced for corporate results in a busy earnings week. The dollar eased against a basket of currencies in thin holiday-impacted trading as gold held above a near four-month low on support from the weaker greenback.  The United States said it will eliminate all waivers that allowed eight countries to buy Iranian oil without facing U.S. sanctions, demanding that the purchases of Iranian oil stop by May 1. The announcement sent oil prices to 2019 highs.Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose as much as 3.5% a barrel and settled at $74.04 a barrel, up $2.07. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose $1.70 to settle at $65.70 after rising as much as 3% during the session. Another drop in Iranian exports would further squeeze supply in a market already tightened through U.S. sanctions against Iran and fellow OPEC member Venezuela, along with voluntary cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. “This does bring a lot more uncertainty in terms of global supplies,” said Olivier Jakob, analyst at Petromatrix. “It is a bullish surprise for the market.” Major financial markets in Europe were closed for Easter Monday, as were markets in Australia and Hong Kong.  Stocks on Wall Street hovered near break-even as the benchmark S&P 500 index was about 1% away from the record high hit in September, boosted in part by largely positive earnings in a market that had sharply lowered its expectations. About one-third of S&P 500 companies, including Boeing Co, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc, will report their quarterly earnings this week. The results will determine whether investors should be concerned about the start of an earnings recession or whether back-to-back quarters of negative growth can be avoided.  S&P 500 profits are expected to drop 1.7% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv data, in what could be the first earnings contraction since 2016. “The market knows and understands earnings are going to be markedly lower this quarter,” said Robert Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston. “It’s the beginning of the next turn in the cycle which is softer earnings.”  The S&P energy index jumped 2.05%, easily the most among the major S&P sectors, as oil prices surged on the U.S. crackdown on Iranian oil exports. [O/R] The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 48.49 points, or 0.18%, to 26,511.05. The S&P 500 gained 2.94 points, or 0.10%, to 2,907.97 and the Nasdaq Composite added 17.21 points, or 0.22%, to 8,015.27. Overnight in Asia shares slipped, pulled lower by underperforming Chinese stocks that retreated from a 13-month high. Comments from top policy-making bodies raised investor fears that Beijing will slow the pace of policy easing after some signs of stabilization. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.3%, edging away from a nine-month peak last week after Chinese economic data beat expectations and eased concerns about the health of the world economy. The Shanghai Composite Index closed down 1.7 percent and Japan’s Nikkei edged up 0.08%. The greenback has found support in recent weeks on the back of a gradual rise in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields and signs of strength in the world’s top economy, including better-than-expected retail sales in March. The dollar index fell 0.19%, with the euro up 0.11% to $1.1258. The Japanese yen was flat versus the greenback at 111.95 per dollar. The Treasury yield curve steepened at the start of a busy week in which $237 billion of new U.S. government debt will be auctioned off.  The spread between the two- and 10-year note yields, the most common measure of the yield curve, steepens when longer-dated yields rise faster than shorter-dated yields, suggesting bullish investor sentiment.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 8/32 in price to push its yield up to 2.5867%. U.S. gold futures settled 0.1% higher at $1,277.60 an ounce.

"NEW YORK   - Oil prices jumped more than 2 percent on Monday to a near six-month high, on growing concern about tight global supplies after the United States announced a further clampdown on Iranian oil exports. Washington said it will eliminate in May all waivers allowing eight economies to buy Iranian oil without facing U.S. sanctions. “The geopolitical risk premium is back in the oil market, in a big way,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. “Most, if not all, legitimate commercial interests will avoid Iran oil purchases. Iran’s flow will be reduced to a trickle.” Brent crude futures rose $2.07, or 2.88 percent, to settle at $74.04 a barrel. The session high of $74.52 a barrel for the international benchmark was the highest since Nov. 1. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures climbed $1.70, or 2.66 percent, to settle at $65.70 a barrel. The contract hit $65.92 a barrel, the highest since Oct. 31. In November the United States reimposed sanctions on exports of Iranian oil but granted waivers to Iran’s eight main buyers: China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Italy and Greece. They were allowed to keep making limited purchases for six months. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated that Washington’s goal was to bring down exports of Iranian oil to zero and said there were no plans for a grace period beyond May 1. U.S. officials are seeking ways to prevent Iran from circumventing oil sanctions, a senior administration official said. Iran said the decision not to renew the waivers has “no value” but Tehran was in touch with European partners and neighbors and would “act accordingly,” Iranian news agencies reported, citing the Foreign Ministry. Another drop in Iranian exports would further squeeze supply in a tight market. The United States has also sanctioned OPEC member Venezuela, and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers including Russia have voluntarily cut output, which has helped raise oil prices more than 35 percent this year. Iran’s biggest oil customers are China and India. India hopes Washington will allow allies to keep buying some Iranian oil instead of halting the purchases altogether from May, a source familiar with U.S.-India talks said. Trump said Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations could “more than make up” for any drop in Iranian oil supplies.  Saudi Arabia said it would coordinate with other producers to ensure an adequate crude supply and a balanced market. “By and large, we expect the Saudis to up output in likely capping Brent price advances to around the $75-76 area followed by some leveling through much of the spring period,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.

"NEW YORK   - Oil climbed about 2 percent to new 2019 highs on Monday, with Brent crude touching $69 a barrel, after positive signs for the global economy and tighter supplies drove both benchmarks’ largest first-quarter gains in nearly a decade.   Brent crude ended the session up $1.43, or 2.1 percent, at $69.01 a barrel after rising to $69.19, its highest since November. The global benchmark rose 27 percent in the January-March period. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures settled up $1.45, or 2.4 percent, at $61.59 per barrel, after reaching their highest in nearly five months at $61.72. WTI gained 32 percent in the first quarter.  “It was the 1-2 punch in terms of positive manufacturing PMI data from China and the U.S., two big economies, and that has emboldened the bulls in the market,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “The big headwind was the string of weak economic data and that has been relieved today, so the bullish narrative is not being held back.”    U.S. stocks rallied after upbeat manufacturing numbers from the United States and China eased worries about slowing global growth. China’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth for the first time in four months in March. U.S. manufacturing numbers also came in better-than-expected in March, helping investors overlook soft retail sales data for February. The United States and China said they made progress in trade talks that concluded on Friday in Beijing, with Washington saying the negotiations were “candid and constructive” as the world’s two largest economies try to resolve their trade war.   China’s State Council said on Sunday that the country would continue to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. vehicles and auto parts after April 1, in a goodwill gesture following a U.S. decision to delay tariff hikes on Chinese imports. “This bull market in energy that has entered its fourth month in duration appears capable of continuing,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates. Production cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries helped push the group’s supply to a four-year low in March, a Reuters survey found, as top exporter Saudi Arabia over-delivered on the group’s supply-cutting pact while Venezuelan output fell further due to U.S. sanctions and power outages. Analysts have turned cautiously optimistic on the oil market, a monthly Reuters poll showed on Friday, lifting their forecast for the average Brent price in 2019 for the first time in five months to $67.12. Hedge funds and money managers raised bullish wagers on U.S. crude to the highest in more than five months, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday. Brent crude speculators also raised net long positions by 13,429 contracts to 322,035 in the week to March 26, data from the Intercontinental Exchange showed. That was the highest level since late October. On the supply front, booming American production has steadied, with the U.S. government reporting on Friday that domestic output in the world’s top crude producer edged lower in January to 11.9 million barrels per day.  U.S. energy companies last week reduced the number of oil rigs operating to the lowest level in nearly a year, cutting the most rigs during one quarter in three years, energy services firm Baker Hughes said.

"HONG KONG   - China’s Huawei is set to reward employee shareholders with a 3 percent rise in cash dividends that are worth billions of dollars, according to company sources and Reuters calculations - a move expected to boost morale as it battles a U.S.-led drive against its telecom gear. The payout also appears to indicate profit growth as well as confidence the company can survive U.S. accusations that its telecoms network equipment may enable espionage by the Chinese government, analysts said. Known for its so-called “wolf culture” that demands high levels of dedication from employees in return for high pay, Huawei Technologies Ltd boasts that some 80,000 of its workers own nearly all of the company’s shares - a scheme viewed as unique for a firm of its size. The cash dividend per share for 2018 is expected to rise to 1.05 yuan per share from 1.02 yuan, six employee-shareholder sources told Reuters, citing internal notices handed down over the past month.    Total returns per share dropped 7 percent to 2.61 yuan, they added. That follows a stock split. There will also be a 1 to 1.56 stock split for 2018, the sources said. “I am satisfied with the number given the macro environment,” said one of sources. Like the other employee shareholders, the source was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be identified. A spokesman for Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker and no. 2 manufacturer of smartphones, said the company does not publicly disclose its dividend policy. The payout comes amid an unprecedented crisis for Huawei as Washington calls on governments around the world to stop using its gear, particularly in 5G networks. The United States has also charged Huawei with bank fraud related to sanctions against Iran and is seeking to extradite Meng Wanzhou, its CFO and the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, from Canada on related charges. Canada on Friday authorized an extradition hearing. Huawei has repeatedly denied its equipment represents a security risk and Meng has said she is innocent of the allegations made against her. Unlisted Huawei discloses very little about its employee shareholder scheme beyond the number of participants and the 1.14 percent holding of founder Ren. But the state-owned Securities Times in February 2018 reported a figure for outstanding shares and a stock split, citing a Huawei internal memo. That implies 20.3 billion shares currently outstanding, which would translate to a cash dividend of 21.3 billion yuan ($3.2 billion). “The dividend shows business fundamentals are good,” said Zhou Zhanggui, an independent Huawei analyst, adding that profits for its smartphone business are likely to come in ahead of expectations. Analysts said the calculations of total dividend payouts seemed accurate based on available information. Huawei said in December it expects 2018 revenue to rise 21 percent to $109 billion, its fastest pace in two years. The company, which made a net profit of 47.5 billion yuan in 2017, is due to announce figures for last year in late March. According to the Securities Times report, its total dividend payout for 2017 was 16.8 billion yuan, equivalent to 35 percent of net profit. Huawei’s hard-driving culture calls for all employees to work every last Saturday of the month, albeit for double pay. Tough postings in remote locations are also not uncommon. Even so, the employee shareholder scheme, a legacy of 1990s reforms in China, is the big draw for many and enables Huawei to rank as the biggest employer of fresh graduates from China’s top two universities. The cash dividend can be as much as annual salary or even more, the sources said. Huawei employs some 180,000 people globally and the shareholder scheme is not open to all, with staff usually only able to take part after three years of strong performance. Before joining the scheme, workers also need to sign a ‘declaration of dedication’ that they voluntarily give up benefits such as paid annual leave, which some jokingly describe as a “slave contract”. “It is a bit like joining the Communist Party or the Youth League at school - it is half voluntary, half mandatory.

"NEW YORK   - Oil futures tumbled more than 3 percent on Monday in their largest daily percentage drop this year after U.S. President Donald Trump called on OPEC to ease its efforts to boost crude prices, which he said were “getting too high.” Brent crude futures fell $2.36, or 3.5 percent, to settle at $64.76 a barrel. U.S. crude ended $1.78, or 3.1 percent, lower at $55.48.  “Oil prices getting too high. OPEC, please relax and take it easy. World cannot take a price hike - fragile!” Trump wrote, in the latest in a series of tweets about oil prices since April 2018. The comments triggered a selloff that halted momentum from Friday’s session, when both benchmarks hit more than three-month highs on expectations for tightening supply and rising hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal.  “I think that tweet set a lot of downward momentum early in the day, and we haven’t recovered,” said Michael O’Donnell, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago.  Crude prices have risen by about 20 percent since the start of the year when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-member producers, such as Russia, cut production to reduce a global glut.  “Trump appears to be attempting to micromanage the oil... to maintain strong enough production to keep global supplies in surplus,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a client note.  “But as far as the Saudis are concerned, today’s tweets could even embolden their efforts toward restraint.” Saudi Arabia recently estimated its production will fall in March by more than anticipated under the supply-reduction agreement, to 9.8 million barrels per day.  In addition, U.S. sanctions on exports from Iran and Venezuela have tightened the market even as production in the United States surges.  “If you read into (Trump’s comments), I think there’s speculation there will, in fact, be another round of waivers granted to countries and companies to buy Iranian oil,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management, said about Trump’s tweet. “That’s also why you’re seeing the negative reaction.” Washington surprised the market after granting waivers to eight Iranian oil buyers when the sanctions on oil imports started in November. Brent futures fell 22 percent that month and the waivers influenced OPEC’s December decision to cut supply starting in 2019. (GRAPHIC: Trump Tweets on oil - tmsnrt.rs/2Evscq7) Goldman Sachs analysts said “the near-term outlook for oil is modestly bullish over the next two to three months”, but added that the outlook for later in 2019 was weaker due to surging U.S. exports and an “an increasingly uncertain economic, policy and geopolitical backdrop”.

"WASHINGTON   - Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday said Congress would oppose U.S. military intervention in Venezuela and challenged the credibility of President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Elliott Abrams, over his past embrace of American covert action. The Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, expressed concern about Trump’s hints that military action was an option in Venezuela, where President Nicolas Maduro is under intense international pressure to step aside and the country’s economy is in chaos. “I do worry about the president’s saber rattling, his hints that U.S. military intervention remains an option. I want to make clear to our witnesses and to anyone else watching: U.S. military intervention is not an option,” Engel told a hearing on the OPEC nation. The head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, Juan Guaido, invoked a constitutional provision to assume the presidency three weeks ago, arguing that Maduro’s re-election last year was a sham. Most Western countries, including the United States, have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state, but Maduro’s socialist government retains the backing of Russia and China, as well as control of state institutions including the military. Under U.S. law, Congress - not the president - must approve foreign military action. At the hearing, Democrats on the committee pressed Abrams on his views on military intervention, but questions about his credibility provoked the most heated exchanges. Abrams, an assistant secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan, was convicted in 1991 of withholding information from Congress during the Iran-Contra scandal, in which U.S. officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran and funneled the money to rebels fighting Nicaragua’s leftist government. He was pardoned by President George H.W. Bush. Representative Joaquin Castro asked Abrams if he was aware of any transfers of weapons or defense equipment by the U.S. government to groups in Venezuela opposed to Maduro. Abrams responded that he was not. “I ask this question because you have a record of such actions,” Castro said. “Can we trust your testimony today?” Representative Ilhan Omar discussed U.S. support for anti-communists in Central America during the Cold War and cited Abrams’ initial dismissal of reports of the 1981 El Mozote massacre in El Salvador as left-wing propaganda. “Would you support an armed faction within Venezuela that engages in war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide if you believe they serve the U.S. interests as you did in Guatemala, El Salvador or Nicaragua?” Omar asked. “I am not going to respond to that question,” Abrams replied. He called her questioning a personal attack. Abrams also drew intermittent outbursts from protesters at the hearing. “You are a convicted criminal!” one man shouted before being escorted out.   Abrams said Washington would keep up pressure on Maduro and his inner circle by “a variety of means.” “But we will also provide off-ramps to those who will do what is right for the Venezuelan people,” he said. Engel warned about the possible effects on the Venezuelan people of U.S. sanctions on state oil company PDVSA. The United States in January imposed sanctions aimed at limiting Maduro’s access to oil revenue. “I appreciate the need to squeeze Maduro,” Engel said. “But the White House must think through the potential repercussions that these sanctions could have on the Venezuelan people if Maduro does not leave office in the coming weeks.” Panel witnesses described a devastating humanitarian situation. Steve Olive of the U.S. Agency for International Development said hospitals faced drastically reduced supplies, there were concerns about the power grid and rising reports of malnutrition. “The situation is deteriorating on a daily basis,” he said.

"LONDON   - OPEC oil supply has fallen in January by the largest amount in two years, a Reuters survey found, as Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies over-delivered on the group’s supply-cutting pact while Iran, Libya and Venezuela registered involuntary declines. The 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 30.98 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, the survey showed on Thursday, down 890,000 bpd from December and the largest month-on-month drop since January 2017. The survey suggests OPEC is almost three quarters of the way in delivering supply cuts that started on Jan. 1 in an effort to avert a glut, even though the group’s second-largest producer Iraq and some smaller members pumped above agreed levels. An OPEC official said he hoped more members would deliver on their pledges and that the drop in supply so far was acceptable, calling it a “good start”. Crude oil has risen to $62 a barrel after a dip below $50 in December, boosted by the Saudi cuts, a host of involuntary curbs in other OPEC countries and the prospect of lower supply from Venezuela after U.S. President Donald Trump this week imposed sanctions on its oil industry.  OPEC, Russia and other non-members - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1. OPEC’s share of the cut is 800,000 bpd, to be delivered by 11 members - all except Iran, Libya and Venezuela. In January the 11 OPEC members bound by the supply-limiting agreement achieved 70 percent of the pledged cuts, the survey found. Further declines in Iran, Libya and Venezuela boosted the total OPEC decline to 890,000 bpd. The latest OPEC+ deal came months after they had agreed to pump more oil, which in turn partially unwound their original supply-limiting accord that took effect in 2017. The biggest drop in supply came from Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest oil producer, which pumped 350,000 bpd less than in December, the survey showed. Saudi supply in November had hit a record-high 11 million bpd, after Trump demanded more be pumped to curb rising prices and make up for losses from Iran. The kingdom rapidly changed course as prices slid on the prospect of oversupply in 2019. The second- and third-biggest drops occurred in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi delivered a larger cut than required under the deal, the survey found. Of the three OPEC members exempted from making voluntary cuts, Libyan production fell the most as unrest kept the country’s biggest oilfield, Sharara, offline for a month. Output from Iran declined further as U.S. sanctions discouraged companies from buying its oil. Iran has managed to maintain crude exports of as much as 1 million bpd, helped by sanctions waivers and its efforts to keep selling crude. Production in Venezuela, once a top-three OPEC producer but whose output has been sliding amid the country’s economic collapse, posted a further drop in January, the survey found. The U.S. sanctions imposed on state oil firm PDVSA this week are keeping tankers stuck at ports and expected to accelerate the supply drop in February. Among countries showing lower compliance, Iraq reduced output in January but pumped more than its target, as did Nigeria and Algeria. Gabon kept output steady. The Reuters survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Refinitiv Eikon flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

"NEW YORK   - Gold hit an eight-month high while world stock markets were mixed ahead of further U.S.-Sino trade talks, a raft of technology company results, including Apple’s, and a Federal Reserve decision on U.S. interest rates. The U.S. dollar traded little changed and oil prices rose after Washington slapped sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil firm in a bid to curb its crude exports as traders prepared for major events, including a key Brexit vote late in the day. Sterling fell after British lawmakers rejected most amendments that aimed to keep Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal, reviving worries of a chaotic withdrawal from the trading bloc that would damage the UK economy. Sterling fell sharply after a brief rise and was down 0.75 percent. Investors expect the Fed, the U.S. central bank, to show a more cautious stance when policymakers release a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting. U.S. economic data in December that was softer than expected and a sharp downturn in financial markets are likely to keep the Fed from raising rates.  Equity markets in Europe rose as investors bid up stocks considered safer during times of economic uncertainty, such as utilities. However, a gauge of global stock performance edged lower as stocks on Wall Street fell amid a ream of mixed earnings reports and caution due to the U.S.-China trade spat. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe was little changed, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares in Europe closed 0.8 percent higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 51.74 points, or 0.21 percent, to 24,579.96. The S&P 500 lost 3.85 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,640 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 57.40 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,028.29. The information glut this week will make it hard for people to reach a conclusion but the trade talks with China, which begin Wednesday, are the overriding issue for the world economy, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. What Washington, and possibly Beijing, fail to understand is that the uncertainty about trade is slowing the global economy, which will show up in East Asian PMI manufacturing data for January to be released on Thursday, Kelly said.  “The biggest tax levy by Washington is an uncertainty tax, and it’s the biggest threat to the markets and the economy this year,” Kelly said. Tensions were high after U.S. officials announced criminal charges against China’s telecom giant Huawei for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. For Asia, the blow was cushioned by promises of more Chinese stimulus but Beijing berated Washington for blocking tactics in its World Trade Organization appeal against U.S. tariffs. Amid the uncertainty, safe-haven gold broke through $1,310 an ounce in spot prices to reach its highest since last May.  U.S. gold futures settled up 0.4 percent at $1,308.90 per ounce. Oil price gains were capped by abundant supply and signs of a slowing Chinese economy. Brent crude oil futures rose $1.39 to settle at $61.32 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained $1.32 to settle at $53.31. Market participants will have catalysts for trading all week, with more than one-fifth of companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index reporting results, including Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook.  Apple Inc reported earnings after the bell and said sales for its fiscal second quarter would most likely be lower than Wall Street expected.  The outlook suggested Apple still faces weak demand for its iPhone, especially in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market. But Apple shares rose 4.3 percent in after-hours trading on upbeat comments from Chief Executive Tim Cook. U.S. Treasury yields fell across maturities as investors anticipated strong demand for $78 billion of new issues on sale later in the day and on data showing U.S. consumer confidence at its lowest since July 2017. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 9/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.7116 percent. The dollar index rose 0.06 percent, while the euro gained 0.01 percent to $1.1434.
