557,"Donald Trump will meet China’s negotiating team at the White House on Friday for the latest round of talks aimed at ending a 15-month trade battle that is weighing on the global economy.“Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I?” the president tweeted. On Wall Street stocks moved higher on hopes that there would be a breakthrough in the dispute.Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House.China’s vice-premier, Liu He, is leading the delegation in negotiations with the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin.This is the 13th round of talks between the two sides and the world’s two biggest economies are deadlocked over US allegations that China steals technology and pressures foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as part of a sharp-elbowed drive to become a world leader in advanced industries such as robotics and self-driving cars.Ahead of the meeting a Chinese official told Bloomberg that China was open to a “partial trade deal” but talks have been further complicated by the US decision to blacklist 28 Chinese tech firms over Beijing’s treatment of Uighur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. That decision came just days before the latest talks were due to start.US-China relations have been further strained by a tweet from Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team, in support of the Hong Kong democracy movement. The tweet, since deleted, led to the cancellation of NBA events in China this week.Under Trump, the US has slapped tariffs on more than $360bn worth of Chinese imports and is planning to hit another $160bn 15 December. That would extend import taxes to virtually everything China ships to the United States. China has hit back by targeting about $120bn in US goods, focusing on farm products.The high cost of the tariffs and uncertainty over when and how the trade war will end have taken an economic toll, especially on manufacturing companies. A private survey last week found that US factory output had dropped to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was in the grips of a deep recession.“Both sides have been losing, and so has the global economy,” said Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce.Brilliant, who spoke with both delegations before the meetings, sounded optimistic about the chances of progress, noting that Beijing has stepped up purchases of US soybeans in a goodwill gesture. He said he hoped a productive meeting would persuade the Trump administration to call off or postpone plans next Tuesday to hike tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports from 25% to 30%.“We all know we can’t afford a further escalation of the trade war,” Brilliant said.Still, Beijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy Washington. Doing so would probably require scaling back the Chinese leaders’ aspirations to technological dominance they see as crucial to their country’s future prosperity.The news came amid the chaos of the impeachment inquiry engulfing US politics, which is examining Trump’s phone call in July where he asked the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate Joe Biden, a leading Democratic rival in the 2020 US presidential election.Trump also last week brazenly asked China in public to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden over their international business dealings, despite no evidence of illicit activity and despite conspiracy theories about the Bidens and Ukraine having been debunked.",Trump to meet with China for talks aimed at ending trade war,2019-10-10/17:37:18,donald trump will meet china s negotiating team at the white house on friday for the latest round of talks aimed at ending a  month trade battle that is weighing on the global economy big day of negotiations with china they want to make a deal but do i the president tweeted on wall street stocks moved higher on hopes that there would be a breakthrough in the dispute big day of negotiations with china they want to make a deal but do i i meet with the vice premier tomorrow at the white house china s vice premier liu he is leading the delegation in negotiations with the us trade representative robert lighthizer and the treasury secretary steven mnuchin this is the th round of talks between the two sides and the world s two biggest economies are deadlocked over us allegations that china steals technology and pressures foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as part of a sharp elbowed drive to become a world leader in advanced industries such as robotics and self driving cars ahead of the meeting a chinese official told bloomberg that china was open to a partial trade deal but talks have been further complicated by the us decision to blacklist  chinese tech firms over beijing s treatment of uighur muslims and other predominantly muslim ethnic minorities that decision came just days before the latest talks were due to start us china relations have been further strained by a tweet from daryl morey the general manager of the houston rockets basketball team in support of the hong kong democracy movement the tweet since deleted led to the cancellation of nba events in china this week under trump the us has slapped tariffs on more than bn worth of chinese imports and is planning to hit another bn  december that would extend import taxes to virtually everything china ships to the united states china has hit back by targeting about bn in us goods focusing on farm products the high cost of the tariffs and uncertainty over when and how the trade war will end have taken an economic toll especially on manufacturing companies a private survey last week found that us factory output had dropped to its lowest level since  when the economy was in the grips of a deep recession both sides have been losing and so has the global economy said myron brilliant head of international affairs at the us chamber of commerce brilliant who spoke with both delegations before the meetings sounded optimistic about the chances of progress noting that beijing has stepped up purchases of us soybeans in a goodwill gesture he said he hoped a productive meeting would persuade the trump administration to call off or postpone plans next tuesday to hike tariffs on bn of chinese imports from  to  we all know we can t afford a further escalation of the trade war brilliant said still beijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy washington doing so would probably require scaling back the chinese leaders aspirations to technological dominance they see as crucial to their country s future prosperity the news came amid the chaos of the impeachment inquiry engulfing us politics which is examining trump s phone call in july where he asked the president of ukraine volodymyr zelenskiy to investigate joe biden a leading democratic rival in the  us presidential election trump also last week brazenly asked china in public to investigate biden and his son hunter biden over their international business dealings despite no evidence of illicit activity and despite conspiracy theories about the bidens and ukraine having been debunked ,US China Trade War,0.223221138
1530,"Donald Trump continued to defend his trade war with China on Tuesday, claiming “great patriot farmers” in the US would benefit from tariff increases that triggered sell-offs in stock markets across the world.In a series of tweets, Trump promised a new deal with China would be reached soon and made a case for how farmers would benefit from a tariff increase that many of them oppose.If China stops buying American farm products because of tariffs, Trump said, farmers will be compensated. “This money will come from the massive tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us. The farmers have been ‘forgotten’ for many years. Their time is now!”The long-running trade dispute between the US and China escalated on Friday after Trump raised tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. China retaliated on Monday with tariffs on $60bn of US imports, precipitating a dive on the US stock markets.American farmers are likely to feel the pain first. Soybean exports to China collapsed last year when the trade war began, and agricultural exports will be hit harder when, or if, the new tariffs are imposed. Farmers are also suffering from extensive flooding that has delayed planting.“The sentiment out in farm country is getting grimmer by the day,” said John Heisdorffer, the chairman of the American Soybean Association. “Our patience is waning, our finances are suffering and the stress from months of living with the consequences of these tariffs is mounting.”The new round of tariffs will hit other parts of the US food industry, with beans, lentils, honey, flour, corn and oats all on the list of goods that will be taxed.Despite the mounting economic threat and escalating tensions, Trump was optimistic about reaching a deal with China.“When the time is right we will make a deal with China,” Trump tweeted. “It will all happen, and much faster than people think!”Trump’s position has divided Republicans, especially those in agricultural districts who fear the retaliatory tariffs will burden farmers, agricultural businesses and consumers.The president’s supporters claim short-term economic pain will have positive long-term consequences.The Republican senator Chuck Grassley, who represents Iowa, a state heavily reliant on agriculture, has called for a quick resolution to the dispute. “Americans understand the need to hold China accountable, but they also need to know that the administration understands the economic pain they would feel in a prolonged trade war,” Grassley said in a statement.• This article was amended on 15 May 2019. An earlier version said that Trump raised tariffs on $200m of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%.

1561,"World markets plunged further on Tuesday following heavy losses on Wall Street after China delivered a swift rebuff to Donald Trump by imposing retaliatory tariffs on $60bn of US imports.Beijing ignored warnings from Trump about the dangers of escalating the trade conflict and sent tremors through global markets by announcing a new 25% import duty on a range of US products.In early trade on Tuesday, Hong Kong led losses when the market reopened after a long weekend. The Hang Seng Index sank 1.7% while Shanghai shed 0.2% and Tokyo was off 0.7% at the break.Sydney and Singapore each dropped more than one percentage point, with Manila and Jakarta both down 1.6%. There were also losses in Taipei and Wellington, though Seoul edged up slightly.Medha Samant, director of investment at Fidelity International, told Bloomberg TV: “In the short term, it looks like volatility is here to stay and we could see this risk-off, risk-on going on for a long time.”The retreat came after the Nasdaq on Wall Street suffered its worst day of 2019 and the Dow ended at its lowest point in more than three months.In the latest stage of the tit-for-tat battle between the world’s two biggest economies, China targeted almost 2,500 products, from food and consumer goods to chemicals and machinery, and said the increases would come into force next month.Apple, Boeing and Caterpillar were the biggest casualties of a global market sell-off as investors concluded that they would be among the companies most affected by China’s action.The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 600 points, both it and the S&P 500 recording their biggest losses since January, after hopes of a speedy resolution to the dispute were replaced by fears of a long and damaging trade war.In London, the blue-chip FTSE 100 fell 39 points, or 0.55%, to end Monday at 7,163, its lowest level since 13 March, while the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized, more UK-focused companies, fell more than 1.2% to a six-week low. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index also hit a two-month low, down 1.2%. Consumer goods-makers and technology firms led the fallers.Trump has drawn up plans to extend US tariffs to the $300bn-plus of Chinese imports not currently targeted, while there were hints from Beijing that it would start to sell some of the US Treasury bonds it holds.The US president took action last week after what the US considered backtracking by China’s president, Xi Jinping, on commitments contained in a 150-page draft trade deal between the two countries.But despite warnings from Trump of the risks of retaliation, China said it would “never surrender” to US pressure.US President Donald Trump Trump has often repeated that China pays for US tariffs on its goods. 'We have billions of dollars coming into our treasury from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our treasury; now we have billions coming in' he said on 24 January 2019. On 5 May he tweeted: 'For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA.' But that is not how tariffs work.China's government and companies in China do not pay tariffs directly. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by US-registered firms to US customs for the goods they import into the United States. Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers - manufacturers and consumers in the United States - by raising their prices.Chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of US tariffs in indirect ways. Exporters sometimes, for instance, are forced to offer US importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher US duties. Chinese companies might also lose business if US importers find another tariff-free source of the same goods outside China. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has acknowledged that 'both sides will suffer on this' contradicting the president. In a series of tweets, Trump said: “I say openly to President Xi & all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don’t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries. Too expensive to buy in China. You had a great deal, almost completed, & you backed out!”He added: “There will be nobody left in China to do business with. Very bad for China, very good for USA! But China has taken so advantage of the US for so many years, that they are way ahead (Our Presidents did not do the job). Therefore, China should not retaliate-will only get worse!”China criticised the White House for its “escalation of Sino-US economic and trade frictions, contrary to the consensus between China and the United States on resolving trade differences through consultations, jeopardising the interests of both sides and not meeting the general expectations of the international community.”Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics, said China’s move would risk provoking Trump. “That could make the prospect of US tariffs being imposed on the remaining $300bn of Chinese imports – provisional details of which were due to be published by the US trade representative later on Monday – even more likely.”China’s new 25% tariff will affect almost 2,500 items, from food and consumer goods to chemicals and machinery. Other products will soon incur a 20% or 10% additional levy.China’s Global Times newspaper reported that Beijing was also considering cutting orders for new Boeing planes and boycotting US agricultural products.Timme Spakman, economist at ING bank, said China’s response could have been harsher and showed that Beijing was keen to keep the door open for negotiations.Trump ordered the tariff increases after talks in Washington with China’s vice-premier Liu He ended with no deal in sight.The president suggested that manufacturers who make goods in China could shift production to other countries to avoid the tariffs. Trump said in another Twitter post that the trade war would not have a significant impact on US trade. “We are right where we want to be with China. Remember, they broke the deal with us and tried to renegotiate. We will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from China. Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal), or buy it from non-tariffed countries.”",Global markets fall as China hits back at US with new import tariffs,2019-05-14/04:47:17,world

1566,"Donald Trump has again defended tariffs as his dogged, often self-contradictory pursuit of a trade war with China put allies and opponents alike in a difficult spot.Stocks tumbled after China said it would impose higher tariffs on US goods including frozen vegetables and liquefied natural gas, in retaliation for America raising tariffs on $200bn in Chinese imports. Trump has threatened to extend tariffs to the remaining $300bn or so in Chinese imports that have not been targeted yet, but told reporters on Monday: “I have not made that decision yet.”As the clash of the world’s two biggest economies raised fears of global shockwaves, Trump denied American consumers would pay the price.“There is no reason for the US consumer to pay the tariffs, which take effect on China today,” Trump tweeted, before offering a convoluted explanation.That put him at odds with his own national economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who was asked on Fox News Sunday: “It’s US businesses and US consumers who pay, correct?”Kudlow replied: “Yes, I don’t disagree with that.”He also acknowledged that “both sides will suffer”.Not for the first time, Trump is scrambling political allegiances. It is especially awkward for Republicans. The president’s protectionist “America first” agenda flies in the face of the party’s free market principles and threatens to hurt voters in red states.Farmers are one example. At a news conference organised by the campaign group Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, in response to the raising of tariffs to 25%, Brent Bible, a soybean and corn farmer in Lafayette, Indiana, said: “Our competitive advantage has always been we are a reliable source of product. This has taken that away.“It has made it … so uncompetitive that other countries are willing to now take the risk that some of the South American countries have in terms of logistics, safety and being reliable. China and others are now willing to take that risk since we are priced so far out of the market.”Trump has promised to “make it up” to farmers hurt by Chinese tariffs against soybeans and other agricultural products. Previously set at $12bn, on Monday he suggested the compensation could go even higher.He said: “We’re going to take the highest year, the biggest purchase that China has ever made with from our farmers, which is about $15bn, and do something reciprocal to our farmers so our farmers can do well.”US President Donald Trump Trump has often repeated that China pays for US tariffs on its goods.

This is no different.Last week the White House issued a list of those who back Trump for taking a hard line after China allegedly reneged on commitments made during months of talks. It included Senator Marco Rubio of Florida: “Not surprised #China is trying to go back on changes they had previously agreed to. For years they have had counterparts so desperate for a deal they allowed them to get away with this. [Trump] is the first to ever pose a credible threat to walk away from a bad deal.”Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said: “I completely support President [Trump]’s approach in trade negotiations with China. This is the last, best chance for America and the world to get China to play by the rules.”Intriguingly, the roll call also quoted Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate: “Hang tough on China, President [Trump]. Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.”Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another Democrat, said: “China’s cheating has hurt American workers for far too long. Tariffs brought China to the negotiating table and now that we’re there, the president must secure real changes to level the playing field.”The remarks illustrate the dilemma facing Democrats. Former vice-president Joe Biden, the frontrunner for 2020, was recently condemned for remarks that played down Chinese competition. “China is going to eat our lunch?” he said. “Come on, man.”Bernie Sanders has pledged to label China a currency manipulator, a stand Trump vowed he would make but was talked out of by advisers. Sanders and another progressive candidate, Elizabeth Warren, share Trump’s distaste for Republican worship of the free market.But centrist Democrats are going on the offensive. Another 2020 contender, the Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton, told Fox News Sunday:“Wielding tariffs like a cudgel because it makes the president look tough? That only hurts American families.”Many feel Trump has hit upon an important theme – the threat posed by China and its long history of flouting rules.A few Republican voices have warned against a prolonged dispute. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told ABC’s This Week he advised the president to finalise a deal with China soon, “because the longer we’re involved in a tariff battle or a trade war, the better chance there is that we could actually enter into a recession because of it”.Trump said on Monday he plans a meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, next month at the G20 summit in Japan. He insisted: “We’re in a great position right now, no matter what we do. I think China wants to have it.”The Associated Press contributed reporting",Trump defends China tariffs as trade war leaves allies and opponents in bind,2019-05-13/21:18:14,donald trump has again

1599,"The US expects China to retaliate over the Trump administration’s latest tariff hike, chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday.“The expected countermeasures have not yet materialized,” Larry Kudlow told Fox News Sunday. “We may know more today or even this evening or tomorrow.”As markets digested the comments, futures trading pointed to a drop in Wall Street stocks on Monday while Asian shares slipped in early trade.Talks ended on Friday and Trump raised the spectre of a full-blown trade war when he ordered that tariffs on Chinese imports worth around $200bn be raised from 10% to 25%.Beijing retaliated for previous tariff hikes by raising duties on $110bn of US imports. Chinese officials have also targeted US companies by slowing customs clearance and stepping up regulatory scrutiny.On Saturday he had tweeted saying Beijing had deliberately sought to delay negotiations. “China felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election, 2020, to see if they could get lucky [and] have a Democrat win,” he said.Kudlow told Fox no more talks were planned but also said there was a “strong possibility” Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping “will meet in Japan at [the] G20” summit at the end of June.In China, state media said the door to talks was always open but China would not yield on important issues of principle. In a commentary carried by the official Xinhua news agency, the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily said there are no winners in any trade war and China did not want to fight but would not be afraid to do so.China and the US are sparring over allegations that China steals technology and pressures US companies into handing over trade secrets, as part of a campaign to turn Chinese companies into world leaders in robotics, electric cars and other advanced industries.Kudlow said China had not implemented changes Washington wanted, including strong enforcement provisions on issues such as forced technology transfer and intellectual property.“We have to have a very strong agreement,” he said, “to correct, to right these wrongs before we will be satisfied”.Kudlow also said Trump’s plan to raise tariffs across the board could take “a couple of months. Call it three months. I don’t know. That will take some time and then of course the president’s going to have to make the final decision on that.”The face-off with China has proved tricky political territory for Democrats, given Trump’s framing of his stance as a defence of American workers.On Sunday the California senator Kamala Harris, a leading contender for the presidential nomination, was asked on CNN’s State of the Union if she agreed with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who this week told Trump he should “hang tough” in his dispute with Beijing.Harris dodged the question, choosing instead to criticise Trump for not working with allies and for “conducting trade policy, economic policy, foreign policy by tweet”.“That’s irresponsible,” she said. “It is a display of a president who thinks that unilateral action is better than working with the friends to address issues that not only impact our country, but impact the globe. And I think it puts us in a weaker position.”Continuing his Twitter thought on Saturday, Trump said “the only problem” with China’s approach to talks “is that they know I am going to win (best economy & employment numbers in US history, & much more), and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!”Many observers have suggested Trump seems not to understand the economic impact of tariffs. One study released this week said that as companies which import steel absorb the cost of tariffs by passing it on to their customers, American consumers and businesses are paying $900,000 a year for every job created or saved by the US action.On Sunday evening Trump returned to Twitter to claim the US was “right where we want to be with China”, and would “be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from China”. He added that “buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal), or buy it from non-tariffed countries”.In a confused pair of tweets, the president also claimed the US would “spend (match or better) the money that China may no longer be spending with our Great Patriot Farmers (Agriculture), which is a small percentage of total tariffs received, and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world! GREAT! #MAGA”.On Sunday, Kudlow conceded to Fox that China does not actually “pay” tariffs, but claimed “the Chinese will suffer GDP losses and so forth with respect to a diminishing export market”.On Sunday the Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul warned that Trump’s policies could damage his claim to the “best economy in US history”, a key line of attack as the 2020 election approaches.Speaking to ABC’s This Week, Paul advised the president to finalise a deal with China soon, “because the longer we’re involved in a tariff battle or a trade war, the better chance there is that we could actually enter into a recession because of it”.","China expected to retaliate over Trump tariff hike, economic adviser says",2019-05-13/02:22:27,the us expects china to retaliate over the trump

1623,"Donald Trump’s obsession with tariffs may be based on one of his few core beliefs. Or it may be part of a grand strategy to win votes. Either way, triggering a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies represents a huge gamble ahead of next year’s US presidential election.The US has raised tariffs on $200bn in imports from China to 25% from 10%, with another round in the offing. Beijing vowed to retaliate but Trump, ever the salesman, claimed on Twitter that the new tariffs will bring “FAR MORE wealth” to America.Trump is notoriously a non-ideological pragmatist who has switched parties and positions on countless issues, but for four decades he has taken a tough line on trade. Dan DiMicco, the former chief executive of the steel company Nucor, told the Washington Post in 2018: “People think he just came to this issue last year, but he came to it on his own, decades ago, seeing what was going on in the ’70s and ’80s with job losses and manufacturing in decline.”Defying Republican party free market orthodoxy, Trump talked about trade relentlessly during the 2016 election campaign and it worked with enough people to help win the electoral college. He therefore sees no reason not to pursue the same course while in office and in the 2020 election.Indeed, Trump and allies insist that the current trade policy has helped generate positive economic growth – 3.2% in the first quarter – though most experts contend that tariffs reduce economic activity by raising prices for consumers.Politically, however, Trump senses an opportunity to divide his opponents and put Democrats in an awkward spot. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, has repeatedly praised him for taking a harder line on China than either Barack Obama or George W Bush.US President Donald Trump Trump has often repeated that China pays for US tariffs on its goods. 'We have billions of dollars coming into our treasury from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our treasury; now we have billions coming in' he said on 24 January 2019. On 5 May he tweeted: 'For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA.' But that is not how tariffs work.China's government and companies in China do not pay tariffs directly. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by US-registered firms to US customs for the goods they import into the United States. Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers - manufacturers and consumers in the United States - by raising their prices.Chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of US tariffs in indirect ways. Exporters sometimes, for instance, are forced to offer US importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher US duties. Chinese companies might also lose business if US importers find another tariff-free source of the same goods outside China. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has acknowledged that 'both sides will suffer on this' contradicting the president. But other Democrats, Trump believes, are vulnerable to the accusation of “weak on China” while he plays strongman putting America first. Former vice-president Joe Biden, currently leading the primary polls, raised eyebrows last week by downplaying the threat of Beijing.At a rally this week in Panama City, Florida, Trump cast doubt on whether another contender, the South Bend mayor, Pete Buttigieg, 37, is up to the job. “We have a young man, Buttigieg … He’s got a great chance, doesn’t he? He’ll be great, representing us against President Xi of China – that’ll be great. I want to be in that room. I want to watch that one.”But there are clear political perils. One of Trump’s favourite applause lines at rallies is the health of the stock market and the stalled talks threaten that run. Studies also show consumers and companies are already paying billions more in higher taxes and lost efficiency.And farmers are especially vulnerable from lost sales to China, an issue on which the president seems to be in denial. He tweeted on Friday: “Your all time favorite President got tired of waiting for China to help out and start buying from our FARMERS, the greatest anywhere in the World!”In fact China is the fourth biggest export market for US agriculture. It bought $9.3bn in American agricultural products last year, according to the US agriculture department. Losing farmers’ votes could prove costly to Trump at the ballot box. And if his tariffs tunnel vision brings about an economic slowdown or worse, his central argument for re-election will be lost.",Tariffs: Donald Trump's trust in trade war tactic is big electoral gamble,2019-05-12/07:00:25,donald trump s obsession with tariffs may be based on one of his few core beliefs or it may be part of a grand strategy to win votes either way triggering a trade war between the world s two biggest economies represents a huge gamble ahead of next year s us presidential election the us has raised tariffs on bn in imports from china to  from  with another round in the offing beijing vowed to retaliate but trump ever the salesman claimed on twitter that the new tariffs will bring far more wealth to america trump is notoriously a non ideological pragmatist who has switched parties and positions on countless issues but for four decades he has taken a tough line on trade dan dimicco the former chief executive of the steel company nucor told the washington post in  people think he just came to this issue last year but he came to it on his own decades ago seeing what was going on in the s and s with job losses and manufacturing in decline defying republican party free market orthodoxy trump talked about trade relentlessly during the  election campaign and it worked with enough people to help win the electoral college he therefore sees no reason not to pursue the same course while in office and in the  election indeed trump and allies insist that the current trade policy has helped generate positive economic growth   in the first quarter though most experts contend that tariffs reduce economic activity by raising prices for consumers politically however trump senses an opportunity to divide his opponents and put democrats in an awkward spot chuck schumer the minority leader in the senate has repeatedly praised him for taking a harder line on china than either barack obama or george w bush us president donald trump trump has often repeated that china pays for us tariffs on its goods we have billions of dollars coming into our treasury from china we never had  cents coming into our treasury now we have billions coming in he said on  january  on  may he tweeted for  months china has been paying tariffs to the usa but that is not how tariffs work china s government and companies in china do not pay tariffs directly tariffs are a tax on imports they are paid by us registered firms to us customs for the goods they import into the united states importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers manufacturers and consumers in the united states by raising their prices chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of us tariffs in indirect ways exporters sometimes for instance are forced to offer us importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher us duties chinese companies might also lose business if us importers find another tariff free source of the same goods outside china white house economic adviser larry kudlow has acknowledged that both sides will suffer on this contradicting the president but other democrats trump believes are vulnerable to the accusation of weak on china while he plays strongman putting america first former vice president joe biden currently leading the primary polls raised eyebrows last week by downplaying the threat of beijing at a rally this week in panama city florida trump cast doubt on whether another contender the south bend mayor pete buttigieg  is up to the job we have a young man buttigieg he s got a great chance doesn t he he ll be great representing us against president xi of china that ll be great i want to be in that room i want to watch that one but there are clear political perils one of trump s favourite applause lines at rallies is the health of the stock market and the stalled talks threaten that run studies also show consumers and companies are already paying billions more in higher taxes and lost efficiency and farmers are especially vulnerable from lost sales to china an issue on which the president seems to be in denial he tweeted on friday your all time favorite president got tired of waiting for china to help out and start buying from our farmers the greatest anywhere in the world in fact china is the fourth biggest export market for us agriculture it bought  bn in american agricultural products last year according to the us agriculture department losing farmers votes could prove costly to trump at the ballot box and if his tariffs tunnel vision brings about an economic slowdown or worse his central argument for re election will be lost ,US China Trade War,0.177981302
1655,"The economic conflict that has been simmering between the US and China has entered a new and dangerous phase. Without question, the world is closer to a full-blown trade war than it has been since the 1930s.The issue now is whether the two sides can step back from the brink. So far, financial markets think the standoff is akin to the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962, the closest the US and the Soviet Union came to nuclear conflict during the cold war.Seen this way, Donald Trump is John F Kennedy, Xi Jinping is Nikita Khrushchev and the goods that have just left Chinese ports on their way to the US are the Soviet missiles en route to Cuba.That Trump’s decision to increase tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200bn (£154bn) of goods only applies to items leaving China after the measure was announced just reinforces the historical parallel. As there was time for Khrushchev to back down, so there is time for Washington and Beijing to do a deal while the ships are crossing the Pacific.China has more to lose from a trade war. It exports far more to the US than it imports, the Chinese economy is slowing and there are only a limited number of additional US products to which tariffs could be applied in the event the tit-for-tat protectionism continues.What’s more, China is more to blame for the hotting up of the trade cold war than the US. The US thought a 150-page draft agreement was the basis for a comprehensive deal, only to find Beijing had filleted the document of its concessions in contentious areas, such as the theft of US intellectual property rights.Now China has met with firm US resistance, the expectation is Xi will back down – as Khrushchev did. Since Trump has no desire to see a meltdown on Wall Street, both sides will seek to avoid the mutually assured destruction a full-blown trade war would involve.But what if the idea that sense will prevail is wrong? What if neither side is prepared to back down? Then, this is not 1962 but the summer of 1914, after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Trump and Xi – both self-styled hardmen with an aversion to backing down – are not Kennedy and Khrushchev but Kaiser Wilhelm II and Tsar Nicholas II.Politically, Trump is seeking to make capital out of the fact he is prepared to stand up to China. In contrast to the views of most economists, he thinks protectionism is good for the US and plays well in swing states.For his part, Xi says he would prefer to talk, but he is prepared to fight if that’s what the US wants. Nationalism plays well in China, so Beijing says reluctantly it has no choice but to respond to Trump’s tariffs with equivalent action of its own. Washington retaliates by putting import duties on the $325bn of Chinese goods it has yet to target.Beijing then starts to make it more difficult for US companies to operate in China and says that if Trump doesn’t back off, it will stop buying US treasury bonds. The White House says it has no intention of doing so and events are set in train that lead remorselessly to the doomsday outcome nobody wanted.",Could doomsday be nearing as US-China trade war heats up?,2019-05-10/18:25:09,the economic conflict that has been simmering between the us and china has entered a new and dangerous phase without question the world is closer to a full blown trade war than it has been since the s the issue now is whether the two sides can step back from the brink so far financial markets think the standoff is akin to the cuban missile crisis of october  the closest the us and the soviet union came to nuclear conflict during the cold war seen this way donald trump is john f kennedy xi jinping is nikita khrushchev and the goods that have just left chinese ports on their way to the us are the soviet missiles en route to cuba that trump s decision to increase tariffs from  to  on bn bn of goods only applies to items leaving china after the measure was announced just reinforces the historical parallel as there was time for khrushchev to back down so there is time for washington and beijing to do a deal while the ships are crossing the pacific china has more to lose from a trade war it exports far more to the us than it imports the chinese economy is slowing and there are only a limited number of additional us products to which tariffs could be applied in the event the tit for tat protectionism continues what s more china is more to blame for the hotting up of the trade cold war than the us the us thought a  page draft agreement was the basis for a comprehensive deal only to find beijing had filleted the document of its concessions in contentious areas such as the theft of us intellectual property rights now china has met with firm us resistance the expectation is xi will back down as khrushchev did since trump has no desire to see a meltdown on wall street both sides will seek to avoid the mutually assured destruction a full blown trade war would involve but what if the idea that sense will prevail is wrong what if neither side is prepared to back down then this is not  but the summer of  after the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand trump and xi both self styled hardmen with an aversion to backing down are not kennedy and khrushchev but kaiser wilhelm ii and tsar nicholas ii politically trump is seeking to make capital out of the fact he is prepared to stand up to china in contrast to the views of most economists he thinks protectionism is good for the us and plays well in swing states for his part xi says he would prefer to talk but he is prepared to fight if that s what the us wants nationalism plays well in china so beijing says reluctantly it has no choice but to respond to trump s tariffs with equivalent action of its own washington retaliates by putting import duties on the bn of chinese goods it has yet to target beijing then starts to make it more difficult for us companies to operate in china and says that if trump doesn t back off it will stop buying us treasury bonds the white house says it has no intention of doing so and events are set in train that lead remorselessly to the doomsday outcome nobody wanted ,US China Trade War,0.200746402
1657,"Donald Trump has insisted that there is “no rush” to secure a deal with China despite growing business and Wall Street fears that the ratcheting up of US tariffs risks a full-blown trade war between the world’s two economic superpowers.US shares, which were falling for much of the day, staged a late rally on Friday night after Trump tweeted that trade talks “will continue” after the hiking of tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.China’s vice-premier Liu He left talks with US Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer after just 90 minutes in Washington, adding to speculation that the gap between the two sides was large.Trump had earlier prompted a warning from the International Monetary Fund that the tariff war posed a threat to the global economy, but the president subsequently used a series of tweets to insist that tariffs were good for the US economy.Beijing has yet to respond to the new US duties – which have been raised from 10% to 25% on $200bn of new Chinese imports into the US – with tariffs of its own but has insisted that it will take retaliatory measures. Meanwhile, Trump threatened to expand tariffs to all Chinese imports into the US.Traders seized on Trump’s later comments over talks, and remarks from Mnuchin that negotiations had been “constructive”. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 114 points, or 0.4% to close at 25,942, earlier it had fallen by more than 300 points.Trump sounded a defensive note after coming under fire from business lobby groups fearful that higher import costs would force US companies and farmers to lay off workers.Trump tweeted: “Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also, much easier & quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted, or go to new source!”Ignoring concerns that purchasing US goods and food and then dumping them on developing world countries could put local firms and farmers out business, he said: “With the over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs that we take in, we will buy agricultural products from our Great Farmers, in larger amounts than China ever did, and ship it to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance.“In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with China in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal!,” he added.China’s ministry of commerce said in a statement just after the scheduled tariffs went into effect: “The Chinese side deeply regrets that it will have to take necessary countermeasures”.“It is hoped that the US and the Chinese side will work together to resolve existing problems through cooperation and consultation,” it said, noting that “high-level economic and trade consultations” were underway. The increased tariffs apply only to goods leaving China after Friday’s deadline and will go into effect only once shipments reach the US, which could take two or three weeks, leaving room still for negotiations.However, investors now face the prospect of a damaging trade war which many fear could destabilise the already slowing global economy and escalate tensions between the two superpowers over flash points such as the South China Sea and industrial espionage. Higher tariffs act like a tax, raising prices and cutting the spending power of consumers.Trump has also said he is preparing the “paperwork” for tariffs of 25% on an additional $325bn worth of Chinese imports, which would mean almost all Chinese goods exported to the US would be levied. Chinese exports to the US accounted for about $540bn last year.The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse. Chinese imports to the US totalled $539.5bn last year, while $120.3bn was sold the other way – leaving a trade deficit of $419.2bn.The president has accused Beijing of “unfair” trade policies, including allowing the theft of US companies’ intellectual property. The threat of import tariffs on Chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks where Trump is seeking changes to Beijing’s trade policy.Tariffs have been imposed by Washington on some Chinese goods sold in the US for about a year. They came on top of broader tariffs used by Trump that have hit China and other trading partners such as the EU, Canada and Mexico, on goods including steel and aluminium.In May 2019 the US president further ratcheted up existing import tariffs of 10% on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods sold in the US to 25%, hitting everything on a long list of products. Trump has previously warned that 25% tariffs could be slapped on a further $325bn of goods in future – which would mean all Chinese imports being covered by tariffs.Richard Partington and Jasper JollyThe US action followed several days in which Trump had lambasted China for backtracking on a deal negotiated over the past five months by making extensive changes to a draft 150-page agreement. Analysts say Beijing may have believed the US was in a weaker bargaining position, based on Trump’s calls to cut interest rates.After several days of near silence on Trump’s threats – state media did not report the president’s comments and social media platforms censored images of his tweets – China has now started to take a more strident stance.Commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said on Thursday: “The US side has given many labels recently: ‘backtracking,’ ‘betraying,’ ... China sets great store on trustworthiness and keeps its promises, and this has never changed”.An editorial published by a government-affiliated Wechat account said: “If you are willing to talk, we’ll talk. If you intend to have a war, then we fight”.China’s options for retaliation include blocking soybean purchases from the US, devaluing the yuan to counteract the tariffs, or setting up non-tariff trade

1679,"Donald Trump has raised the stakes in the simmering US-China trade war, imposing higher tariffs on $200bn (£154bn) of Chinese goods. Here are the answers to key questions about the dispute between the world’s two largest economies.The US president has ratcheted up existing import tariffs of 10% on certain Chinese goods sold in the US to 25%.The increase came into effect on Friday on a long list of products shipped after 12.01am EDT.There was no breakthrough in talks in Washington between the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the Chinese vice-premier Liu He before the midnight deadline.Trump has warned 25% tariffs could be imposed on a further $325bn of goods in future, which would mean all Chinese imports being covered by tariffs.The short answer is, we do not know. Geng Shuang, at China’s foreign ministry, told reporters to “stay tuned” about any retaliation.In a statement shortly after the tariff increase came into effect, China’s commerce ministry said it “deeply regrets” the need to take “necessary countermeasures”.What is clear is that Beijing will not be able to impose reciprocal tariffs, because China’s imports from the US are less than $200bn. But it does have other options, including raising existing tariffs, restricting US companies in China and making it tougher for Americans to qualify for visas.That said, China has also expressed hope both sides could reach an agreement.Recent stock market moves had been relatively muted as negotiations continued, but Trump’s escalation of tensions at the start of the week prompted a major selloff. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average had its worst one-day drop since January.However, there was little reaction in European markets on Friday morning, with all investors firmly focused on the talks.Investors also took heart from the unofficial grace period offered by Washington, which means goods that set off from China to the US before the midnight deadline will still be taxed at 10%.These are only the latest tariffs imposed in the tit-for-tat dispute. Washington has put tariffs on some Chinese goods sold in the US for about a year. They are on top of broader tariffs used by Trump that have affected China and other trading partners such as the EU, Canada and Mexico, on goods including steel and aluminium.The Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on $50bn of Chinese tech goods in June 2018, covering aerospace, automobiles, communications and robotics, in an attempt to hinder Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” initiative aimed at strengthening its manufacturing and technology base.The White House then imposed tariffs of 10% on $200bn of goods in September, on a wider range of products including food ingredients, construction materials, bike parts and burglar alarms. These are the tariffs that have been increased to 25%.China has retaliated to previous measures with $110bn of tariffs on US goods, including agricultural produce such as soya beans, as well as cars, luggage, electronics, housewares and food.The roots of the dispute are Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’s position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse. According to US Census Bureau data, Chinese imports to the US totalled $539.5bn last year, while $120.3bn was sold the other way – a trade deficit of $419.2bn.The US president has accused Beijing of “unfair” trade policies, including allowing the theft of US companies’ intellectual property. The threat of import tariffs on Chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks in which Trump is seeking changes to Beijing’s trade policy.Trump has sold the tariffs as a boon for US workers (and voters) that will bring back employment to “rust belt” industrial areas that have lost jobs to China. However, the overwhelming economic consensus is that tariffs are mostly passed on via higher prices – ultimately paid by those same workers.Shipping times between the US and China mean the majority of price increases are likely to be passed on in two to four weeks’ time – enough time for a deal that would avoid higher prices and potentially dodge a significant blow to economic growth.Trump is well known for ramping up the rhetoric in trade talks and has previously said he can only secure new trade deals by threatening or imposing tariffs on trading partners. Having said that, the White House has confirmed talks between the two sides would resume on Friday, with hopes a deal could still be reached.Trump said on Thursday he had received a “beautiful letter” from China’s president, Xi Jinping. He quoted Xi as saying: “Let’s work together, let’s see if we can get something done.”",US-China trade war: all you need to know about Trump's tariffs,2019-05-10/11:45:59,donald trump has raised the stakes in the simmering us china trade war imposing higher tariffs on bn bn of chinese goods here are the answers to key questions about the dispute between the world s two largest economies the us president has ratcheted up existing import tariffs of  on certain chinese goods sold in the us to  the increase came into effect on friday on a long list of products shipped after  am edt there was no breakthrough in talks in washington between the us trade representative robert lighthizer and the chinese vice premier liu he before the midnight deadline trump has warned  tariffs could be imposed on a further bn of goods in future which would mean all chinese imports being covered by tariffs the short answer is we do not know geng shuang at china s foreign ministry told reporters to stay tuned about any retaliation in a statement shortly after the tariff increase came into effect china s commerce ministry said it deeply regrets the need to take necessary countermeasures what is clear is that beijing will not be able to impose reciprocal tariffs because china s imports from the us are less than bn but it does have other options including raising existing tariffs restricting us companies in china and making it tougher for americans to qualify for visas that said china has also expressed hope both sides could reach an agreement recent stock market moves had been relatively muted as negotiations continued but trump s escalation of tensions at the start of the week prompted a major selloff on tuesday the dow jones industrial average had its worst one day drop since january however there was little reaction in european markets on friday morning with all investors firmly focused on the talks investors also took heart from the unofficial grace period offered by washington which means goods that set off from china to the us before the midnight deadline will still be taxed at  these are only the latest tariffs imposed in the tit for tat dispute washington has put tariffs on some chinese goods sold in the us for about a year they are on top of broader tariffs used by trump that have affected china and other trading partners such as the eu canada and mexico on goods including steel and aluminium the trump administration imposed  tariffs on bn of chinese tech goods in june  covering aerospace automobiles communications and robotics in an attempt to hinder beijing s made in china  initiative aimed at strengthening its manufacturing and technology base the white house then imposed tariffs of  on bn of goods in september on a wider range of products including food ingredients construction materials bike parts and burglar alarms these are the tariffs that have been increased to  china has retaliated to previous measures with bn of tariffs on us goods including agricultural produce such as soya beans as well as cars luggage electronics housewares and food the roots of the dispute are trump s america first project to protect the us s position as the world s leading economy while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the us and to manufacture products there trump complains of a large trade deficit with china which he views as a symbol of the us s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse according to us census bureau data chinese imports to the us totalled  bn last year while  bn was sold the other way a trade deficit of  bn the us president has accused beijing of unfair trade policies including allowing the theft of us companies intellectual property the threat of import tariffs on chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks in which trump is seeking changes to beijing s trade policy trump has sold the tariffs as a boon for us workers and voters that will bring back employment to rust belt industrial areas that have lost jobs to china however the overwhelming economic consensus is that tariffs are mostly passed on via higher prices ultimately paid by those same workers shipping times between the us and china mean the majority of price increases are likely to be passed on in two to four weeks time enough time for a deal that would avoid higher prices and potentially dodge a significant blow to economic growth trump is well known for ramping up the rhetoric in trade talks and has previously said he can only secure new trade deals by threatening or imposing tariffs on trading partners having said that the white house has confirmed talks between the two sides would resume on friday with hopes a deal could still be reached trump said on thursday he had received a beautiful letter from china s president xi jinping he quoted xi as saying let s work together let s see if we can get something done ,US China Trade War,0.311648816
1701,"Investors were hopeful of a breakthrough in talks between the US and China as negotiators worked to prevent an escalation in tit-for-tat tariffs that threaten a full-scale trade war between the world’s two largest economies.Amid rising concerns that President Donald Trump would unilaterally raise tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods on Friday, Beijing scrambled to assure Washington that it was sincere in wanting to reach a deal.President Xi Jinping sent a message to Trump that he would talk to his US counterpart ahead of the deadline of 0500 GMT, which Trump has said could also trigger tariffs on a further $325bn of goods, covering almost the total volume of Chinese imports to the US. A full-blown trade war between Washington and Beijing would send shockwaves through the global economy – investors registered their concern by posting steep declines in stock markets this week.Trump said on Thursday he had received a “beautiful letter” from Xi as negotiations on a trade deal between the two countries continued in Washington.“He just wrote me a beautiful letter. I’ve just received it and I’ll probably speak to him by phone,” said Trump. Later he quoted Xi as saying in the letter: “Let’s work together, let’s see if we can get something done.” The US president added he believed a deal could be done this week, but accused China of sabotaging recent talks by seeking a renegotiation.“We’re getting very close to a deal then they started to renegotiate the deal. We can’t have that. We can’t have that,” said Trump.It is understood a day of talks with China’s vice-premier, Liu He, had made progress, but it was unclear whether the two sides were close to reaching an agreement.The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse.

Hong Kong’s main benchmark fell 2.4% and the Shanghai composite index lost 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones index was down 0.6% on Thursday afternoon.Analysts said the modest losses were an indication that investors expected the two sides to reach a deal, though the volatile path of trade negotiations meant an escalation was possible before one could be signed.Earlier in the day, the US trade representative’s office filed the paperwork in preparation for a tariff hike, giving Trump the authority to increase tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200bn of goods including food, chemicals and building materials.The move followed a breakdown in talks last weekend when the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, accused China of going back on commitments previously made in talks.Officials close to the talks said they got an inkling of China’s second thoughts about prior commitments during talks last week in Beijing, but that the backsliding became even more apparent in exchanges over the weekend. Neither side has provided details of specific issues involved, although the clashes are thought to include differences over intellectual property theft and requiring US companies operating in China to share technology with Chinese counterparts.The US is keen to open up Chinese markets to US businesses and protect them from being forced to hand over technology and go into partnership with Chinese firms. Lighthizer has also stressed Beijing must agree to a transparent dispute resolution regime.But Trump has appeared more concerned with trying to bring down the US’s huge trade deficit with China. Unfortunately for the White House, his tactics so far have depressed trade with China but failed to halt Washington’s growing trade deficit with the rest of the world.Figures show the US trade deficit – the difference between US exports and imports – hitting a record $621bn in 2018, with China accounting for $419.2bn of that.Marianne Schneider-Petsinger, a trade analyst at the thinktank Chatham House, said: “The Chinese response so far has been quite measured, knowing that Trump is playing to a domestic audience and with his re-election looming needs a strong US economy.“Even with this latest escalation, both sides have a strong interest in striking a deal,” she said.Some Chinese commentators said Beijing was ready for a fight with the US.“China is not afraid of conflict,” said the Global Times, a newspaper published by the ruling Communist party’s People’s Daily, which is known for its nationalist tone. It said Beijing had measures in place to minimise losses for its companies.“Mentally and materially, China is much better prepared than its US counterpart,” the newspaper said.However, factories in Chinese coastal regions have suffered declines of up to 40% in sales to the US, increasing the pressure on Xi to find a way to sign a deal.In April, Chinese exports to the US plunged 13% compared with a year ago, and are down 9.7% since the start of 2019. Total Chinese exports fell 2.7% in April. Imports of American goods tumbled 26%.

1737,"Donald Trump has accused China of “breaking” a deal it had reached in trade talks with the US, as the two countries moved to within 36 hours of a full-scale trade war and the US trade representative’s office filed the formal paperwork needed to increase duties on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods.Speaking at a rally in Florida on Wednesday night, the US president said: “By the way, you see the tariffs we’re doing? … Because they broke the deal. They broke the deal. So they’re flying in, the vice premier tomorrow’s flying in – good man – but they broke the deal. They can’t do that, so they’ll be paying.”The president added: “If we don’t make the deal, nothing wrong with taking it over $100bn a year – $100bn, we never did that before.”Beijing said it would be forced to impose “necessary countermeasures” if the increases take effect on Friday, though it gave no details of what that would entail. “China deeply regrets that if the US tariff measures are carried out, China will have to take necessary countermeasures,” said the commerce ministry in a statement.The last-minute sparring came after Washington published a list of imported products that will face higher tariffs from Friday.Trump earlier held out the prospect that China would make concessions at an 11th-hour meeting in Washington but financial markets – unsettled by the most serious threat of protectionism since the 1930s – were downbeat about a breakthrough. China has threatened to retaliate against any step up in US action.Share prices have been rising since the turn of the year on hopes that the world’s two biggest economies would settle their differences.But the mood has darkened in the past week after the Trump administration accused Beijing of backtracking on measures the US believed had been agreed. These included addressing issues such as the theft of US intellectual property and trade secrets; the forced transfer of technology; competition policy; access to financial services and currency manipulation.After a fall of almost 500 points on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed with little change on Wednesday but the jittery mood led to investors seeking out traditional safe havens such as gold.Washington said China was seeking to renege on its commitments, rendering the 150-page draft agreement worthless. The US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has been insisting China make changes to its domestic laws to prove it would not renege on the deal.But the US found in each of the seven chapters of the draft trade deal, China had deleted commitments, raising doubts in Washington about whether Beijing would comply. As a result, Trump has said he will end the moratorium on higher tariffs on Chinese imports that has been in place since a truce was called at the end of 2018.The US president said he hoped a Chinese delegation – due to arrive in the US on Thursday and led by vice-premier Liu He – would do a deal in this week’s talks but also made it clear Washington was prepared to ratchet up tariffs.Trump tweeted: “The reason for the China pullback & attempted renegotiation of the Trade Deal is the sincere HOPE that they will be able to “negotiate” with Joe Biden or one of the very weak Democrats, and thereby continue to ripoff the United States (($500 Billion a year)) for years to come.“Guess what, that’s not going to happen! China has just informed us that they (Vice-Premier) are now coming to the US to make a deal. We’ll see, but I am very happy with over $100 Billion a year in Tariffs filling U.S. coffers...great for U.S., not good for China!”The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse.

Jennifer McKeown, of Capital Economics, said goods exports to the US accounted for 3.2% of China’s national output, while exports to China made up only 0.6% of US gross domestic product. So far, McKeown added, tariffs had knocked 0.4 points off China’s growth and 0.2% off US growth.“We think that the direct effect of an increase in the tariff on the $200bn list to 25% would be to hit Chinese GDP by around another 0.1 percentage points. If the 25% tariff were extended to the rest of Chinese exports to the US that might knock a further 0.3 percentage points off GDP. The effects on the US would probably be minimal, due to the lesser importance of trade with China and the fact that China would struggle to retaliate as it is running out of imports to tax.”Liam Fox, the UK’s trade secretary, said he understood the Trump administration’s frustration with China over issues such as forced technology transfers and the dumping of goods on global markets but the dispute would be better solved through the multilateral system.",'They'll be paying': Trump blasts China as US prepares to raise trade tariffs,2019-05-09/06:37:03,donald trump has accused china of

1808,"China’s chief trade negotiator will travel to Washington this week, according to the commerce ministry, tempering fears that talks to resolve a protracted trade war between the US and Beijing had been scuppered.Liu He, a vice-premier, will hold negotiations in Washington on Thursday and Friday, according to the Chinese ministry, which did not elaborate on the agenda.Beijing has been largely muted in its response to Donald Trump’s threat on Sunday to raise tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods by the end of the week. On Monday, the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, said China had gone back on commitments previously made in talks.Speaking on Tuesday at a regular press briefing, Geng Shuang, the foreign ministry spokesman, said: “Adding tariffs can’t resolve any problem. Talks are by their nature a process of discussion. It is normal for both sides to have differences. China won’t shun problems and is sincere about continuing talks.”While the official Chinese stance has remained restrained, an editorial published in state media outlets including the People’s Daily and Xinhua took a stronger line, calling out the US for attempting to place “extreme pressure” on China.The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse. Chinese imports to the US totalled $539.5bn last year, while $120.3bn was sold the other way – leaving a trade deficit of $419.2bn.The president has accused Beijing of “unfair” trade policies, including allowing the theft of US companies’ intellectual property.

Trump has previously warned that 25% tariffs could be slapped on a further $325bn of goods in future – which would mean all Chinese imports being covered by tariffs.Richard Partington and Jasper Jolly“The US needs to recognise the situation and see where its best interest[s] lie … before that day, maintaining strength is the most important factor in dealing with the Sino-US issue.

Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, said: “For us at the IMF, it’s imperative that trade tensions are resolved in a way satisfying for everyone, because clearly tensions between the US and China are the threat to the global economy.”",China confirms vice-premier Liu He will visit US for trade talks,2019-05-07/12:13:48,china s chief trade negotiator will travel to washington this week according to the commerce ministry tempering fears that talks to resolve a protracted trade war between the us and beijing had been scuppered liu he a vice premier will hold negotiations in washington on thursday and friday according to the chinese ministry which did not elaborate on the agenda beijing has been largely muted in its response to donald trump s threat on sunday to raise tariffs from  to  on bn bn of chinese goods by the end of the week on monday the us trade representative robert lighthizer said china had gone back on commitments previously made in talks speaking on tuesday at a regular press briefing geng shuang the foreign ministry spokesman said adding tariffs can t resolve any problem talks are by their nature a process of discussion it is normal for both sides to have differences china won t shun problems and is sincere about continuing talks while the official chinese stance has remained restrained an editorial published in state media outlets including the people s daily and xinhua took a stronger line calling out the us for attempting to place extreme pressure on china the roots of the dispute come from us president donald trump s america first project to protect the us position as the world s leading economy while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the us and to manufacture their products there trump complains of a large trade deficit with china which he views as a symbol of the us s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse chinese imports to the us totalled  bn last year while  bn was sold the other way leaving a trade deficit of  bn the president has accused beijing of unfair trade policies including allowing the theft of us companies intellectual property the threat of import tariffs on chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks where trump is seeking changes to beijing s trade policy tariffs have been imposed by washington on some chinese goods sold in the us for about a year they came on top of broader tariffs used by trump that have hit china and other trading partners such as the eu canada and mexico on goods including steel and aluminium in may  the us president further ratcheted up existing import tariffs of  on bn bn of chinese goods sold in the us to  hitting everything on a long list of products trump has previously warned that  tariffs could be slapped on a further bn of goods in future which would mean all chinese imports being covered by tariffs richard partington and jasper jolly the us needs to recognise the situation and see where its best interest s lie before that day maintaining strength is the most important factor in dealing with the sino us issue no matter what the situation is the pace of our development will not change and cannot change said the editorial published under the wechat account taoran notes things we believe are advantageous for us we will do without anyone asking things that are unfavourable to us no matter how you ask we will not take any step back don t even think about it the editorial said adding that the chinese economy s recent recovery shows the country s resilience bai ming the deputy director of the commerce ministry s international market research institute told the state run global times on monday the us should know by now that china will never give in to pressure despite signalling its resolute stance the fact that china is still sending a delegation may be a sign of beijing s eagerness to reach a deal diana choyleva the chief economist at enodo economics said china needs a deal more than the us and the last thing it wants is to see tariffs go up to  she pointed out the resumption of talks is a cause for optimism this is a positive sign although it doesn t mean there won t be more nasty bumps along the road to a deal choyleva said on tuesday germany s economy minister and france s finance minister both called on the us and china to resolve the trade war christine lagarde the head of the international monetary fund said for us at the imf it s imperative that trade tensions are resolved in a way satisfying for everyone because clearly tensions between the us and china are the threat to the global economy ,US China Trade War,0.30603081
1856,"Donald Trump has escalated the trade war with China by announcing plans to hike the tariff imposed on $200bn of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on Friday.The US president also threatened to impose tariffs on all Chinese trade with America, a move that could further destabilise relations between the two economic powers.The move prompted sharp falls in stocks in Asia Pacific on Monday with China’s blue chip stock index dropping 4% – its biggest fall for two months – while the Hang Seng fell 2.5%. Fears that Trump’s comments could sink the trade talks were compounded when the editor of China’s Global Times newspaper said on Monday that China’s vice premier Liu He was now “very unlikely” to go to the United States this week.“Let Trump raise tariffs. Let’s see when trade talks can resume,” Hu Xijin said in a tweet.Trump announced the move on Twitter, complaining that negotiations between the two countries were proceeding too slowly.He tweeted: For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200 Billion Dollars of other goods. These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results. The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday. 325 Billions Dollars....The move will affect more than 5,000 products made by Chinese farms and factories, from fresh and frozen food to chemicals, textiles, metalwork, building materials, electronics and consumer goods.Trump originally imposed a 10% tariff on these goods last September in an attempt to cut America’s trade deficit with China and force concessions on issues such as intellectual property rights. It had been scheduled to jump to 25% in January but the president held back while talks between the two sides continued.Currently, almost half of China’s sales to America are affected by tariffs and Trump is now aiming for the remaining $325bn.The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there.Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse. Chinese imports to the US totalled $539.5bn last year, while $120.3bn was sold the other way – leaving a trade deficit of $419.2bn.The president has accused Beijing of “unfair” trade policies, including allowing the theft of US companies’ intellectual property. The threat of import tariffs on Chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks where Trump is seeking changes to Beijing’s trade policy.Tariffs have been imposed by Washington on some Chinese goods sold in the US for about a year. They came on top of broader tariffs used by Trump that have hit China and other trading partners such as the EU, Canada and Mexico, on goods including steel and aluminium.In May 2019 the US president further ratcheted up existing import tariffs of 10% on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods sold in the US to 25%, hitting everything on a long list of products. Trump has previously warned that 25% tariffs could be slapped on a further $325bn of goods in future – which would mean all Chinese imports being covered by tariffs.Richard Partington and Jasper JollyHe warned: “325 Billions Dollars of additional goods sent to us by China remain untaxed, but will be shortly, at a rate of 25%. The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China. The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!”Such a move could cause further pain and disruption to the Chinese economy, and probably trigger retaliatory action by Beijing.Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management, warned that Trump’s move could disappoint investors and push markets down.“The prospect of higher and broader tariffs was one factor that drove markets down in the fourth quarter of 2018, but markets have since come to believe that some sort of deal was imminent to avoid them,” Chovanec said.But Reva Goujon, vice president for global analysis at Stratfor, suggested that Trump’s move could be a ploy to help get negotiations over the line.#Trump threat to impose 25% #tariffs on remaining Chinese goods may ironically be a sign of real progress.

5402,"As tensions between China and the US mount over trade and the extradition of a senior Huawei executive, Beijing has reserved its most colourful language for America’s allies.On Tuesday, China’s ministry of foreign affairs called on Canada to “stop pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the US” after the unsealing of a 13-count indictment against the Huawei chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada in December. An editorial in the state-run Global Times put it more bluntly: “You cannot live the life of a whore and expect a monument to your chastity … If Canada insists on wrong practice, it must pay for it.”Analysts say China is trying to isolate the US by going after its allies. Two Canadians remain in detention in China over unspecified allegations of endangering national security and a third was sentenced to death for drug smuggling after a sudden retrial — cases widely believed to be retaliation for Ottawa’s arrest of Meng at the request of the US.“China is trying to divide and conquer. It wants to put maximum pressure on individual countries and not have them band together,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution in Washington.Canada is not the only US ally to get on the wrong side of Beijing. Chinese state media called Poland an “accomplice of the US”, saying Warsaw “must pay for the offence” after Polish authorities arrested a Huawei employee on suspicions of espionage.And an Australian-Chinese writer, Yang Hengjun, was detained in China just weeks after Australia voiced concern over China’s detention of Canadian citizens. Australian officials say they do not believe Yang’s arrest is related to the Huawei case.“One tactic the Chinese Communist party appears to be using is to attempt to drive wedges between the US and its allies, with the goal of forcing countries to make a choice between the US and China,” said Samantha Hoffman, an analyst on Chinese security.Under President Xi Jinping, China has departed from a decades-long policy of keeping a low profile, to assert itself more on the international stage. China is wooing more countries with economic projects such as the  “belt and road” initiative, a massive global investment and trade push that will involve more than 70 countries and more than a third of global GDP.As China’s economic presence grows worldwide, its lobbying efforts have expanded to Nato allies and other US partners previously outside the traditional range of US-China competition, according to Rorry Daniels, an Asia security expert and consultant.“What Beijing has done is to give US allies a stake in China’s continued economic growth and to use those economic ties as leverage to reward or punish allies in accordance with China’s interests,” Daniels said.Some say Beijing’s efforts are part of a larger goal of undermining alliances altogether, as the US under Donald Trump has cast doubt on the international system. Over the past year, president Trump has questioned the common defence principle of Nato, which maintains that an attack on one member is an attack on all.“Beijing is taking advantage of an opportunity presented by Washington,” Daniels said. “Beijing has long seen US alliances as a constraint on its ability to use its power to advance its national interests and would like to see these relationships weakened or ended.”In addition to carrots in the form of economic incentives, observers worry Beijing is deploying increasingly larger sticks. Both Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, were detained within 10 days of Meng’s arrest in Canada.That same month, a court suddenly ordered the retrial of Canadian Robert Schellenberg, previously sentenced to 15 years of prison for drug smuggling, in a case that took more than three years to settle.“The Chinese government is making it very difficult for democratic governments to respond. Liberal democracies certainly cannot respond reciprocally to the PRC’s tactics without undermining their own political systems. Governments are also being forced into an ethical dilemma,” Hoffman said.Such efforts could prove counterproductive, with more countries opting to take a harder line against China and blocking Huawei products and services. Germany is considering banning Huawei 5G equipment. New Zealand and Australia have already barred the use of its equipment, while BT in the UK said it had removed Huawei kit.Others point out that China’s efforts are no different from the lobbying and diplomatic campaigns of most countries. “At the very least, they want more people to hear China’s views,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor at Renmin University and expert on US-China relations.“What China is doing is natural, it’s not about exerting pressure. This hasn’t worked in the short term, but in the long term it will — along as China uses appropriate methods and language.”",'Divide and conquer': China puts the pressure on US

6376,"US and Chinese officials held their first face-to-face negotiations since a 90-day truce was declared in a trade war between Washington and Beijing, in the hope of ending a bruising confrontation between the world’s two largest economies.Hopes that the sixth round of negotiations between the two sides could yield a breakthrough helped Asian shares rise on Monday, combined with optimism about the state of the global economy on the back of strong US jobs figures on Friday.In Tokyo, the Nikkei soared more than 3% and there were also strong positive moves in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney.Talks among mid-level US and Chinese trade representatives were scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. Chinese vice-premier and economic czar Liu He unexpectedly attended the talks, according to Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources.After failing to reach an agreement in December when Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met, both sides agreed to suspend tariff increases while holding discussions on technology transfers, as well as intellectual property theft and cybersecurity. If no agreement is reached, US tariffs on $200bn (£160bn) of Chinese goods will increase in March to 25% from the current 10%.Trump said on Sunday that China was under pressure to do a deal amid signs of a slowdown in its economy. “I think China wants to get it resolved. Their economy’s not doing well. I think that gives them a great incentive to negotiate,” he said.Analysts believe the talks were unlikely to produce a major breakthrough but will lay important groundwork for an agreement that both sides appear increasingly eager to reach.“The situation now is that both sides are facing some economic problems. China is facing an export pressure and a likely economic downturn. The US is facing a falling stock market. Thus, both sides are willing to talk and are expecting a deal,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “I think it’s possible to reach a deal before March if both sides talk and move fast,” he said.China’s leaders in particular are under pressure to end a trade war that is exacerbating an already slowing Chinese economy in which exports, factory output, and consumer confidence have all declined.“China’s slowdown is occurring across the board, affecting almost every industry and region,” said Scott Kennedy, a trade expert focused on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Resolving the trade war or at least finding some common ground with Washington will be needed to fully restore confidence,” he said.The delegation, led by the US deputy trade representative, Jeffrey Gerrish, does not include any top US officials from the administration, a sign the talks will be a precursor to higher-level meetings.Chinese vice-premier Liu He, may travel to Washington in February and Trump may meet the Chinese vice-president, Wang Qishan, at the World Economic Forum in Davos near the end of this month, according to reports.The US delegation includes officials from the Treasury, and energy and agriculture departments, as well as the State Department and the White House, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.“It promises to be the first time that the core of the agenda will centre around the problems caused by Chinese industrial policy and the need to marketise China’s economy,” said Kennedy.“If they can make sufficient progress on identifying the key issues and narrowing in on the possible solutions, that will pave the way for Chinese vice-premier Liu He to visit Washington in the coming weeks,” he added.Key US exports including soya beans, corn and pork, as well as liquefied natural gas, are currently subject to retaliatory tariffs from China. China’s industrial policy, “Made in China 2025”, which the US argues violates World Trade Organization rules, is likely to be a topic of discussion.China is likely to raise the issue of the telecoms firm Huawei, whose global ambitions have been thwarted by a US ban on its products. The arrest in Canada of a senior Huawei official, Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the US has spiralled into a diplomatic incident, which includes two Canadians still detained in China.Gerrish, the head of the US delegation, is likely to follow the lead of the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, one of the most hawkish members of the Trump administration. Gerrish has previously described Lighthizer as one of his “incredible mentors”.Observers say that beyond reaching an agreement, a major sticking point will be over how to confirm that both sides uphold it. Chinese officials have reportedly indicated a willingness to establish such a mechanism.“The big issue is not just that an agreement is reached, but verifiability – that China is living up to their end of the bargain,” said Christopher Balding, a former associate professor of business and economics at the HSBC business school in Shenzhen, who writes about the Chinese economy.In recent weeks, Beijing has made some conciliatory gestures, including drafting new rules that would ban forced technology transfers. China has promised to buy more US goods as well as cut tariffs, and improve market access for foreign companies in China. Still, these concessions and economic pressures both sides face may not be enough to bring both sides to a deal.“The US is very wary of Chinese changes as simply being paper reforms that change little on the ground. That perception will be very difficult to overcome,” said Roland Rajah, the director of the international economy programme at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. He said that any agreement is likely to be framed as part of ongoing negotiations, with the threat of tariffs kept in place.He said: “The broader relationship has been deteriorating quite rapidly, meaning neither side want to cave in too much on the substantive issues as they see it as part of a broader and longer term strategic battle.” ",US and China resume trade talks with both eager for

7379,"Even by Donald Trump’s standards his Twitter rant attacking China on Friday was extraordinary. In a series of outbursts Trump “hereby ordered” US companies to stop doing business with China, accused the country of killing 100,000 Americans a year with imported fentanyl and stealing hundred of billions in intellectual property.The attack marked a new low in Sino-US relations and looks certain to escalate a trade war already worrying investors, manufacturers and economists who are concerned that the dispute between the two economic superpowers could trigger a recession.Not so long ago Trump called China’s president, Xi Jinping, “a good friend”. Now he is an “enemy”. How did we get here?On the campaign trail Trump railed against China accusing it of pulling off “one of the greatest thefts in the history of the world” and “raping” the US economy.Trump repeated the word China so often it spawned a viral video of him saying it over and over again. The attacks were a hit with voters and helped get him elected. He has continued lambasting China – to cheers – at rallies ever since.His main beef? The trade deficit.The US imported a record $539.5bn in goods from China in 2018 and sold the Chinese $120.3bn in return. The difference between those two numbers – $419.2bn – is the trade deficit.That deficit has been growing for years as manufacturing has shifted to low-cost China and, according to Trump, it explains the hollowing out of US manufacturing.For Trump, and especially for his adviser Peter Navarro, who once described China as “the planet’s most efficient assassin”, trade deficits represent an existential threat to US jobs and national security. China makes up the largest part of the US trade deficit but those fears are also behind his disputes with the EU, Canada and Mexico.His detractors argue these deficit worries are hyperbole and a result of the US’s stronger economy, which allows consumers to buy goods at cheaper prices.The truth is probably somewhere in between.While it’s true that unemployment is at record lows and consumers continue to prop up the economy, manufacturing jobs have been lost (automation is also to blame for this) and with them wage growth (although the hollowing out of unions plays a part here).But it is not just deficits that concerns Trump.China has a deserved reputation for intellectual property theft. On Friday, Trump estimated China robs the US of “hundreds of billions” a year in ideas.In March, a CNBC poll found one in five US corporations had intellectual property stolen from them within the last year by China.According to the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, the theft costs $600bn a year.Like Tesla, Nio, a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company, is suffering as subsidies for EVs are phased out. Unlike Tesla, Nio has Xi. China is pumping $1.5bn into the company to keep it on the road, the latest in a series of handouts that the Trump administration believes are unfair.Cheap steel and aluminium, subsidized by the Chinese government, are the origins of this trade dispute. According to the White House, last year alone China dumped and unfairly subsidized goods including steel wheels, tool chests and cabinets and rubber bands on to the US market.To be fair the US too is more than willing to bail out its industries (see: the banks or the automakers) at the taxpayers’ expense. But at this point “fair” is not up for discussion.Earlier this month the US officially accused China of manipulating its currency “to gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade”.It was the first time since 1994 that such a complaint has been made official and comes as the dollar has strengthened against world currencies. The dispute adds another layer of tension to a complex situation.China disputed the charge accusing the US of “deliberately destroying international order” with “unilateralism and protectionism”.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears to be on China’s side, arguing the devaluation of the yuan is largely in line with worsening economic conditions in China.The US has now slapped billions of dollars on tariffs on Chinese goods. China retaliated, again, on Friday with more levies on US goods. China’s economic growth has slowed to levels unseen since 1992; US economic forecasts have also been cut. American farmers were the first to feel the result, as China has canceled orders, and manufacturers are increasingly gloomy. So far US consumers have not felt the pinch but JP Morgan estimates the average US household will end up paying an extra $1,000 a year for goods if the latest set of tariffs go through.The unanswerable question is whether any of this will sway Trump. If his supporters continue to see a trade war with China – and the pain it will cause – as the necessary price to Make America Great Again, then the answer is probably no.",Here are the reasons for

8084,"Global stocks fell sharply on Friday after Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on $300bn (£247.6bn) of Chinese goods in a rapid escalation of the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Trump is applying pressure to try to force China to narrow the trade deficit – the gap between imports and exports – between the two countries. He complains that China buys fewer US goods than the US buys from China, a gap worth $419.5bn last year. He has also accused Chinese firms of stealing US companies’ intellectual property and called for Beijing to alter its rules.Tariffs are border taxes imposed by one country or economic bloc on goods shipped from a trading partner. The idea is to drive up the cost of those goods to make them less attractive to consumers than domestic produce. The taxes are paid by buyers of goods when they cross the border into the country imposing the tariff.Trump is threatening tariffs of 10% on $300bn of Chinese imports. The White House already levies tariffs of 25% on $250bn of Chinese goods. Adding both together would mean roughly all Chinese imports to the US face higher taxes. China sold $539.7bn of goods to the US last year.Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of up to 25% on US goods worth $113bn. China is constrained by how much further it can go, given that total imports from the US were worth $120.1bn last year. However, the trade war has extended beyond tariffs before, with rules to make life difficult for US or Chinese companies, such as the US blacklisting the Chinese technology company Huawei.The International Monetary Fund has said the US-China trade war is dragging on global growth. Last month it said the conflict would cut growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2019 and 2020 from its April forecasts, at 3.2% and 3.5% respectively. International trade growth has stalled and business investment has been paused because of the uncertainty over trade. Factory output has stalled in several countries including the UK, Germany and Italy, with a knock-on impact on growth. Central banks including the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are under pressure to cut interest rates as a consequence.The escalation from Trump was a surprise and China has said it will not be intimidated – a sign that the conflict will not dissipate quickly. Economists believe tariffs could just be a negotiating tactic and the US president has flip-flopped before, raising hopes of a resolution. Trump could also expand his trade war to involve other nations, as well as the EU. He has tariffs on car imports in his sights, ostensibly to protect the US auto industry. Economists say imposing car tariffs on the EU would dramatically escalate the global trade war and further damage global growth.",Why is Trump imposing tariffs on China and how could it affect global economy?,2019-08-02/13:06:14,global stocks fell sharply on friday after donald trump threatened to impose tariffs on bn  bn of chinese goods in a rapid escalation of the trade war between the world s two biggest economies trump is applying pressure to try to force china to narrow the trade deficit the gap between imports and exports between the two countries he complains that china buys fewer us goods than the us buys from china a gap worth  bn last year he has also accused chinese firms of stealing us companies intellectual property and called for beijing to alter its rules tariffs are border taxes imposed by one country or economic bloc on goods shipped from a trading partner the idea is to drive up the cost of those goods to make them less attractive to consumers than domestic produce the taxes are paid by buyers of goods when they cross the border into the country imposing the tariff trump is threatening tariffs of  on bn of chinese imports the white house already levies tariffs of  on bn of chinese goods adding both together would mean roughly all chinese imports to the us face higher taxes china sold  bn of goods to the us last year beijing has retaliated with tariffs of up to  on us goods worth bn china is constrained by how much further it can go given that total imports from the us were worth  bn last year however the trade war has extended beyond tariffs before with rules to make life difficult for us or chinese companies such as the us blacklisting the chinese technology company huawei the international monetary fund has said the us china trade war is dragging on global growth last month it said the conflict would cut growth by   percentage points in  and  from its april forecasts at   and   respectively international trade growth has stalled and business investment has been paused because of the uncertainty over trade factory output has stalled in several countries including the uk germany and italy with a knock on impact on growth central banks including the us federal reserve and european central bank are under pressure to cut interest rates as a consequence the escalation from trump was a surprise and china has said it will not be intimidated a sign that the conflict will not dissipate quickly economists believe tariffs could just be a negotiating tactic and the us president has flip flopped before raising hopes of a resolution trump could also expand his trade war to involve other nations as well as the eu he has tariffs on car imports in his sights ostensibly to protect the us auto industry economists say imposing car tariffs on the eu would dramatically escalate the global trade war and further damage global growth ,US China Trade War,0.303900987
9182,"Donald Trump has threatened fresh tariffs on $4bn (£3.2bn) of European products including cheese, scotch whisky and olives, ratcheting up pressure on the EU in a long-running row over aircraft subsidies.The US trade representative’s office released a list of 89 additional items – including olives, Italian and Dutch cheese, Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, pasta, coffee and ham – that could face tariffs. These join products worth $21bn that were announced as potential targets for tariffs in April, which included roquefort cheese, wine, champagne, olive oil and seafood such as oysters. The latest list also includes a number of copper products and other metals.The move came days after a truce was reached in the trade war between the US and China.The US and the EU have both threatened to impose tariffs on planes, tractors and food in a tit-for-tat trade row that was sparked by aircraft subsidies given to US aircraft maker Boeing and its European rival, Airbus.Trump imposed a 25% tariff on European steel and 10% on aluminium imports that came into effect in May 2018, as he claimed  “trade wars are good”. The EU responded in February by imposing limits on steel imports.Tariffs are border taxes charged on foreign imports. Importers pay them upon entry to the customs agency of the country or bloc imposing them.Tariffs can be levied in different ways. It can be a flat-rate tariff linked to weight, or calculated as a proportion of the overall value of the goods. It can also be a mixture of both. A country can set a quota, enabling a certain volume of a product to flow in before a higher tariff rate kicks in.Tariffs raise money for governments, but are primarily used to raise the price of foreign goods, protecting domestic producers from global competition.Countries signed up to the World Trade Organization (WTO) must impose tariffs at the same level for all other WTO-member trading partners under the organisation’s “most favoured nation” rule – unless they secure alternative deals with particular countries or trading blocs.Richard PartingtonThe World Trade Organization has found that Boeing and Airbus, the world’s two largest aircraft makers, received billions of dollars of subsidies, in the world’s largest-ever corporate trade dispute. The WTO is expected to rule on the US sanctions request over the summer, although this could be postponed to September.However, during the Paris Air Show in mid-June, Reuters reported that the US could be open to negotiations on an “enforceable mechanism” that would allow Airbus to receive government funding on commercial terms.

10118,"In the end, it was not the ceaseless lying, the Muslim ban, the alleged obstruction of justice, the pandering to white supremacists, the demonization of immigrants, or the climate change denialism that most outraged Donald Trump’s party. The norm-shattering president finally became too much for Republican politicians when he threatened to do something else entirely – impose tariffs on Mexican imports.On Tuesday, Republican senators emerged enraged from a meeting with Trump, unwilling to stomach his threat to level tariffs as high as 25% on Mexican goods in retaliation for migrants crossing the border. Even Senator Ted Cruz, the former Trump punching-bag (“Lyin’ Ted”) who has since become a reliable Trump ally, railed against the proposed tariffs, calling them “new taxes” on Texas farmers, manufacturers and small businesses. Otherwise spineless Republican senators are having this change of heart because of an important political reality: tariffs will make goods more expensive in the states they need to capture in 2020.Like Texas, Michigan would be hit hard by a trade war. Thanks to the automobile industry’s complex supply chains, it is the state most dependent on imports from Mexico – and, as Republicans know all too well, crucial to Trump’s re-election prospects. He is already running 12 points behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders there, according to one recent poll.Trump’s ongoing trade war with China has cost him political capital throughout the midwest, where farmers depend on imports and exports. His approval rating in Iowa has dropped a staggering 21 points since he took office. In Wisconsin, he’s lost 19 points, and in Ohio, 18. Trump’s base alone cannot carry him, especially with so many Democrats motivated to drive him out of office.US President Donald Trump Trump has often repeated that China pays for US tariffs on its goods. 'We have billions of dollars coming into our treasury from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our treasury; now we have billions coming in' he said on 24 January 2019. On 5 May he tweeted: 'For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA.' But that is not how tariffs work.China's government and companies in China do not pay tariffs directly. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by US-registered firms to US customs for the goods they import into the United States. Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers - manufacturers and consumers in the United States - by raising their prices.Chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of US tariffs in indirect ways. Exporters sometimes, for instance, are forced to offer US importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher US duties. Chinese companies might also lose business if US importers find another tariff-free source of the same goods outside China. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has acknowledged that 'both sides will suffer on this' contradicting the president. This is the only kind of math Republican lawmakers understand, because it speaks to their survival. The most ravenous Republicans will never desert Trump, and his approval rating among party regulars remains strong, but his 2016 success hinged on razor-thin margins in a handful of midwestern states. There is no path to victory without them. Conservatives beyond the cult of Trump comprehend this – that their dear leader is not infallible, that his 30-year obsession with combating trade deficits could be his undoing.He lashes out at allies and trading partners around the globe, a jingoistic braying with no true end-gameTrump, more through instinct than any kind of sober economic analysis, has long understood that the free-trade agreements of the 1990s hastened globalization, punished the American worker, and allowed jobs to flee elsewhere. He violated the GOP’s orthodoxy on free trade and still commandingly won a primary. He knew tacking left on trade wasn’t going to cost him votes.But Trump’s hatred of a globalized world that would cheapen the value of labor is not tied up in any defense of the American worker. If it were, he would embrace strong labor unions, consumer protections, universal healthcare and cheap housing for America’s precarious working class. He rejects actual uplift in favor of lashing out at allies and trading partners around the globe, a jingoistic braying with no true endgame. He says his Mexican tariffs will begin on Monday. And then what?If Trump doesn’t get the immigration concessions from Mexico that he wants, and overrides Republican opposition to impose tariffs starting at 5% on imports, how far will Republicans in Congress go to oppose him?So far, they have been the most pliant class of lawmakers in recent history, tolerating his rank incompetence in the hope he implements enough of the conservative agenda to set Democrats back a generation. Denying science or catering to white supremacists was not enough to foment any kind of rebellion among Republicans in Congress – they, too, reject the reality of climate change and refuse to ostracize the most hateful elements of their base – but tariffs could do the trick, if only because they pose an electoral challenge for Trump 2020.There is no Trump economic policy or Trump government as much as the man himself, executing ill-informed policy on instinct. Dissenting voices have been excised. How far Trump goes with his tariffs will be up to Trump. If Trump is defeated next year, it will be because of Trump – his motives, his decisions, his rage.

10647,"Over the last week, China’s state media outlets have called the US government delusional, compared it to apes shouting on a river bank, and offered to teach the Americans a Chinese idiom: diandao heibai, “to invert black and white”, or deliberately distort the truth.As trade tensions mount between the US and China, Beijing faces the difficult task of appealing to national pride to shore up confidence in the leadership while also keeping public anger in check.As US-China ties have deteriorated over the last year, Chinese officials and state media have been relatively restrained. Official statements refer to “trade frictions” with the US, rather than a “trade war”, and have been careful not to name Donald Trump directly or criticise the country as a whole.“They want to send the message that they are being firm, that they are in control, that China’s economy is healthy and capable of self-sufficiency,” said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, a research programme affiliated with the University of Hong Kong.“I believe the thinking here is not to directly antagonise Trump, not to escalate and makes things too personal. Because at some point, for all the talk of self-reliance and preparing for a new ‘long march’ and so on, China wants to get back to the table,” he said.After the breakdown of trade talks and US moves to list Huawei and potentially other Chinese companies on a trade blacklist, voices within Chinese state and private media are growing more strident.An editorial in the People’s Daily on Wednesday accused the US of “bullyism”, while a bulletin on the state broadcaster CCTV said the US was “delusional” if it believed “technological bullying” could contain China. “This shows some American politicians are extremely narrow-minded and cannot tolerate the normal pursuit of development and progress of other countries,” the announcer said.The harsher sentiments appear to be resonating with the public. Earlier in the week, a song written by a former Chinese official about the trade war, set to the tune of a fight song featured in an anti-Japanese wartime film, had been viewed thousands of times on WeChat.A clip of a CCTV news segment from last week promising that China would “fight to the end” was one of the top viewed posts on the microblogging site Weibo. And last weekend, a CCTV film channel aired a series of documentaries about the Korean war, when Chinese and US forces clashed. “We are using movies to echo the current era,” the broadcaster said on its Weibo account on Saturday.But Mao-era levels of mobilisation or overzealous nationalism could turn into something difficult for authorities to control. In 2012, anti-Japanese riots erupted across Chinese cities over rights to disputed islands in the East China Sea.The CCTV segment from Wednesday night garnered more than 1,100 comments, with many commentators supporting a harder government line. “Less slogans, more real strength,” one said.“For China’s leadership, nationalism is a very useful part of a coherent super-narrative about China’s return to greatness under the leadership of the party,” Bandurski said. “But the party is insistent on keeping the party at the very centre of national pride.“Anti-Americanism could very easily become a force the party cannot control.”",'We'll fight to the end': China's media ramps up rhetoric in US trade war,2019-05-23/11:06:14,over the last week china s state media outlets have called the us government delusional compared it to apes shouting on a river bank and offered to teach the americans a chinese idiom diandao heibai to invert black and white or deliberately distort the truth as trade tensions mount between the us and china beijing faces the difficult task of appealing to national pride to shore up confidence in the leadership while also keeping public anger in check as us china ties have deteriorated over the last year chinese officials and state media have been relatively restrained official statements refer to trade frictions with the us rather than a trade war and have been careful not to name donald trump directly or criticise the country as a whole they want to send the message that they are being firm that they are in control that china s economy is healthy and capable of self sufficiency said david bandurski co director of the china media project a research programme affiliated with the university of hong kong i believe the thinking here is not to directly antagonise trump not to escalate and makes things too personal because at some point for all the talk of self reliance and preparing for a new long march and so on china wants to get back to the table he said after the breakdown of trade talks and us moves to list huawei and potentially other chinese companies on a trade blacklist voices within chinese state and private media are growing more strident an editorial in the people s daily on wednesday accused the us of bullyism while a bulletin on the state broadcaster cctv said the us was delusional if it believed technological bullying could contain china this shows some american politicians are extremely narrow minded and cannot tolerate the normal pursuit of development and progress of other countries the announcer said the harsher sentiments appear to be resonating with the public earlier in the week a song written by a former chinese official about the trade war set to the tune of a fight song featured in an anti japanese wartime film had been viewed thousands of times on wechat a clip of a cctv news segment from last week promising that china would fight to the end was one of the top viewed posts on the microblogging site weibo and last weekend a cctv film channel aired a series of documentaries about the korean war when chinese and us forces clashed we are using movies to echo the current era the broadcaster said on its weibo account on saturday but mao era levels of mobilisation or overzealous nationalism could turn into something difficult for authorities to control in  anti japanese riots erupted across chinese cities over rights to disputed islands in the east china sea the cctv segment from wednesday night garnered more than   comments with many commentators supporting a harder government line less slogans more real strength one said for china s leadership nationalism is a very useful part of a coherent super narrative about china s return to greatness under the leadership of the party bandurski said but the party is insistent on keeping the party at the very centre of national pride anti americanism could very easily become a force the party cannot control ,US China Trade War,0.163627222
10755,"A few years ago, as part of a western delegation to China, I met Xi Jinping in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. When addressing us, Xi argued that China’s rise would be peaceful, and that other countries – namely, the US – need not worry about the “Thucydides trap”, so named for the Greek historian who chronicled how Sparta’s fear of a rising Athens made war between the two inevitable. In his 2017 book Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?, Harvard University’s Graham Allison examines 16 earlier rivalries between an emerging and an established power, and finds that 12 of them led to war. No doubt, Xi wanted us to focus on the remaining four.Despite the mutual awareness of the Thucydides trap – and the recognition that history is not deterministic – China and the US seem to be falling into it anyway. Though a hot war between the world’s two major powers still seems far-fetched, a cold war is becoming more likely.The US blames China for the current tensions. Since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has reaped the benefits of the global trading and investment system, while failing to meet its obligations and free riding on its rules. According to the US, China has gained an unfair advantage through intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, subsidies for domestic firms and other instruments of state capitalism. At the same time, its government is becoming increasingly authoritarian, transforming China into an Orwellian surveillance state.For their part, the Chinese suspect that the US’s real goal is to prevent them from rising any further or projecting legitimate power and influence abroad. In their view, it is only reasonable that the world’s second-largest economy (by GDP) would seek to expand its presence on the world stage. And leaders would argue that their regime has improved the material welfare of 1.4 billion Chinese far more than the west’s gridlocked political systems ever could.Regardless of which side has the stronger argument, the escalation of economic, trade, technological, and geopolitical tensions may have been inevitable. What started as a trade war now threatens to escalate into a permanent state of mutual animosity. This is reflected in the Trump administration’s national security strategy, which deems China a strategic “competitor” that should be contained on all fronts.Accordingly, the US is sharply restricting Chinese foreign direct investment in sensitive sectors, and pursuing other actions to ensure western dominance in strategic industries such as artificial intelligence and 5G. It is pressuring partners and allies not to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s massive programme to build infrastructure projects across the Eurasian landmass. And it is increasing US Navy patrols in the East and South China Seas, where China has grown more aggressive in asserting its dubious territorial claims.The global consequences of a Sino-American cold war would be even more severe than those of the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union. Whereas the Soviet Union was a declining power with a failing economic model, China will soon become the world’s largest economy, and will continue to grow from there. Moreover, the US and the Soviet Union traded very little with each other, whereas China is fully integrated in the global trading and investment system, and deeply intertwined with the US, in particular.A full-scale cold war thus could trigger a new stage of deglobalisation, or at least a division of the global economy into two incompatible economic blocs. In either scenario, trade in goods, services, capital, labour, technology and data would be severely restricted, and the digital realm would become a “splinternet,” wherein western and Chinese nodes would not connect to one another. Now that the US has imposed sanctions on ZTE and Huawei, China will be scrambling to ensure that its tech giants can source essential inputs domestically, or at least from friendly trade partners that are not dependent on the US.In this Balkanised world, China and the US will both expect all other countries to pick a side, while most governments will try to thread the needle of maintaining good economic ties with both. After all, many US allies now do more business (in terms of trade and investment) with China than they do with America. Yet in a future economy where China and the US separately control access to crucial technologies such as AI and 5G, the middle ground will most likely become uninhabitable. Everyone will have to choose, and the world may well enter a long process of deglobalisation.Whatever happens, the Sino-American relationship will be the key geopolitical issue of this century. Some degree of rivalry is inevitable. But, ideally, both sides would manage it constructively, allowing for cooperation on some issues and healthy competition on others. In effect, China and the US would create a new international order, based on the recognition that the (inevitably) rising new power should be granted a role in shaping global rules and institutions.If the relationship is mismanaged – with the US trying to derail China’s development and contain its rise, and China aggressively projecting its power in Asia and around the world – a full-scale cold war will ensue, and a hot one (or a series of proxy wars) cannot be ruled out.

1530,"  - Gap Inc (GPS.N) said on Thursday it plans to hire more than 30,000 seasonal workers for the upcoming holiday season, lower than the 65,000 target the apparel retailer had set for 2018. The holiday season, which includes Black Friday, Christmas and New Year, is the busiest time of the year for retailers and brings in a majority of their total sales. A Gap spokeswoman said total seasonal hiring is lower this year to give current employees the opportunity to pick up more hours.  Hiring plans often indicate sales expectations of retailers and come against the backdrop of a softening retail environment and a prolonged U.S.-China trade war that has threatened to increase costs for retailers. Big-box retailer Target Corp (TGT.N) said earlier this month that it planned to hire more than 130,000 store employees for the holiday season, a roughly 8% rise from last year, but much lower than the 20% increase in 2018 and a 43% jump in 2017. Retail jobs contracted for a seventh straight month in August to hit their lowest since January 2016, which hinted at softer U.S. consumer spending going into the Christmas season.   Gap said on Thursday it would host a one-day event on Oct. 5 at all its stores, as well as select distribution and customer centers across the United States and Canada to hire as many as 5,000 work associates as part of the holiday hiring plan. Shares of the company were down about 2% in afternoon trading.

4869,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. business inventories rose moderately in May as sales rebounded, suggesting that inventory accumulation could have been a drag on economic growth in the second quarter. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that business inventories increased 0.3% after advancing 0.5% in April. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. May’s reading was in line with economists’ expectations. Retail inventories increased 0.4% in May instead of  rising 0.5% as estimated in an advance report published last month. Motor vehicle inventories rose 0.7% in May, rather than advancing 0.8% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.3% as reported last month.  Economists expect inventories subtracted from GDP growth in the second quarter after contributing 0.55 percentage point to the economy’s 3.1% annualized growth pace in the January-March period. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 1.4% rate in the second quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP next week.  The accumulation in inventories reflects tepid domestic demand early in the year. A trade war between the United States and China has also added to the inventory bloat as businesses stocked up in an effort to get ahead of the tariff fight. Wholesale inventories increased 0.4% in May. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.2%. Most of the inventory overhang is in the automobile industry, which is experiencing a slowdown in sales, contributing to weak production at factories. Business sales rebounded 0.2% in May after falling 0.2% in the prior month. At May’s sales pace, it would take 1.39 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from April.  The motor vehicle inventory-to-sales ratio was unchanged at 2.35 months in May.

6000,"  - Wall Street surged on Tuesday and the S&P 500 approached a record high after Washington rekindled trade talks with Beijing, boosting sentiment along with growing investor confidence that the Fed will cut interest rates this year. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit later this month, and said talks between the two countries would restart after a recent lull. Global stock markets have rallied and retreated repeatedly in recent months in reaction to comments from Trump about progress - or lack of progress - in negotiating an end to the trade conflict. Trump’s statement on Tuesday pushed trade-sensitive industrials up 1.9% and technology stocks gained 1.7%. Together, they were the biggest boost to the benchmark index.  Chip companies, which have a sizable revenue exposure to China, led the rally in tech stocks, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index surging 4.3%. “We can’t discount how big a deal it is for China and the U.S. not to go into a prolonged trade spat. I don’t think we’re out of the woods yet, though,” said King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.  “I’d wait for the G20 meeting to see actual discussions coming out of that before we go back into a risk-on mode,” he said.  The U.S.-China trade war and its impact on economic growth have investors increasingly expecting the Federal Reserve will cut rates to preserve the U.S. economic expansion, which would be the longest on record this summer. The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its two-day policy meeting that ends Wednesday, while laying the foundation for a cut later this year. The Fed is scheduled to release its statement at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Wednesday and Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference shortly after. The S&P 500 has gained 6% so far this month, and is only about 1% from the all-time high hit in early May.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.35% to end at  26,465.54 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.97% to 2,917.75. The Nasdaq Composite surged 1.39% to 7,953.88. Comments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi  indicating the possibility of fresh rate cuts or asset purchases also lifted sentiment. Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp rose between 0.8% and 2.4%, with the tech triumvirate contributing more than any other stocks to increases in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Boeing Co jumped 5.4%, buoying the Dow, after the planemaker received an order for its 737 MAX jets valued at more than $24 billion at list prices; the 737 MAX has been grounded since March after two deadly crashes.     The utilities, real estate and consumer staples sectors, all of which are viewed as defensive, were the only decliners. With about two weeks left in the second quarter, analysts on average expect second-quarter S&P 500 earnings per share to increase by 0.2%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In early April, that estimate stood at 2.8% growth. The S&P 500 posted 57 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 46 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.0 billion shares, compared to the 6.8 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

6376,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING   - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was ready to impose another round of punitive tariffs on Chinese imports if he cannot make progress in trade talks with China’s President at a Group of 20 summit later this month. Since two days of talks to resolve the U.S.-China trade dispute last month in Washington ended in a stalemate, Trump has repeatedly said he expected to meet President Xi Jinping at the June 28-29 summit in Osaka, Japan. China has not confirmed any such meeting. Trump said last week he would decide after the meeting of the leaders of the world’s largest economies whether to carry out a threat to impose tariffs on at least $300 billion in Chinese goods.  In comments to reporters on Monday, Trump said he still thought the meeting with Xi would happen. “We are scheduled to talk and to meet. I think interesting things will happen. Let’s see what happens,” Trump told reporters at the White House. The United States has already imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods.  China’s foreign ministry said on Monday that China is open to more trade talks with Washington but has nothing to announce about a possible meeting. Tensions between Washington and Beijing rose sharply in May after the Trump administration accused China of having reneged on promises to make structural economic changes during months of trade talks. The United States is seeking sweeping changes, including an end to forced technology transfers and theft of U.S. trade secrets. It also wants curbs on subsidies for Chinese state-owned enterprises and better access for U.S. firms in Chinese markets. On May 10, Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods up to 25% and took steps to levy duties on an additional $300 billion in Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated with tariff hikes on a revised list of $60 billion in U.S. goods. The U.S. government has also angered China by putting Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on a blacklist that effectively bans U.S. companies from doing business with the Chinese firm, the world’s biggest telecoms equipment maker. Investors worry China will retaliate by putting U.S. companies on a blacklist or banning exports to the United States of rare earth metals, which are used in products such as memory chips, rechargeable batteries and cell phones. Fitch Ratings said on Monday any such move would be disruptive to the U.S. technology sector and could hurt some Chinese sectors as well, though it added that it was too early to assess potential credit implications. In an interview with CNBC, Trump said the Huawei dispute could be addressed as part of a trade deal with China. The escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies has unnerved financial markets with worries that it could further disrupt global manufacturing and supply chains and push an already slowing global economy into recession. On Sunday, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said resolving the current trade tensions should be the top priority for G20 economies. China reported on Monday its exports unexpectedly grew 1.1 percent in May from a year ago despite the higher U.S. tariffs, but imports fell the most in nearly three years. Some analysts suspect Chinese exporters may have rushed out shipments to the United States to avoid potential new U.S. tariffs. Many U.S. business groups oppose the tariffs, with companies worried about slowing demand as they pass higher prices along to consumers and manufacturers across a range of products. Late last month Trump said he would impose tariffs on Mexican goods if Mexico did not agree to take strong steps to curb the flow of mostly Central American migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Washington and Mexico City reached a deal on Friday to avert the tariffs, removing for the time being at least the prospect that the United States would find itself in trade wars with two of its three largest trading partners. Global equities rose on Monday and the U.S. dollar gained against a basket of currencies. The Mexican peso rose more than 2% against the greenback, reversing most of its losses from the past couple of weeks.  Trump, who has embraced protectionism as part of an “America First” agenda, said on Monday the tariff threat on Mexico would be reinstated if Mexico’s Congress did not ratify another part of the migration pact.

11238,"WASHINGTON   - President Donald Trump on Friday said he is confident the United States can forge a trade deal with China, but added that he thinks his country would do very well with or without an agreement with the world’s second-largest economy.  Asked if he was still confident he could get a deal with China: “Sure, I’m confident, but if we don’t make a very good deal for our country, I wouldn’t make a deal,” Trump said. Asked about a report that China was not positive about a trade deal and that a meeting with President Xi Jinping might not happen, Trump said “I haven’t heard that. I think we’re doing well ... We’ll do very well either way, with or without a deal.”   Speaking on Bloomberg TV, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the two countries could meet soon to continue hammering out a deal. “It could go into April ... We made a lot of agreements here in Washington two weeks ago ... Now it has to go back and clear the top level of President Xi and the politburo in Beijing ... That’s the key – not the timing, not even the place – we have to get it right so it’s in America’s interest,” Kudlow said. China’s exports tumbled the most in three years in February while imports fell for a third straight month, pointing to a further slowdown in the economy and stirring talk of a “trade recession”, despite a spate of support measures. The increasingly weak China data comes amid months of intense negotiations between Washington and Beijing aimed at ending their trade dispute.

11348,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that trade talks with China were moving along well and predicted either a “good deal” or no deal between the world’s two largest economies. Washington and Beijing have been locked in intense negotiations to end a months-long trade war. Trump, citing progress in talks, last week delayed a planned tariff increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods. “They’re moving along well and we’ll see what happens,” the president said on Wednesday during a meeting in the Oval Office, referring to the trade talks. He said there would either be “a good deal or it’s not going to be a deal, but I think they’re moving along very nicely.” Trump’s comments after the Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the U.S. goods trade deficit surged to a record high in 2018 as strong domestic demand fueled by lower taxes pulled in imports, despite the president’s tariffs and “America First” policies aimed at shrinking the trade gap. Talks are primarily taking place via video teleconference and going well, Ted McKinney, undersecretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, told a press call.   “Right now, I think there’s just a lot of work in getting words down ... a contract or agreement, and that’s the current status,” he added. The United States has demanded that China make substantial changes to its laws and practices to protect U.S. intellectual property, end forced transfers of U.S. technology to Chinese firms, curb generous industrial subsidies and open the domestic market to U.S. companies. In addition, Washington has sought increased Chinese purchases of U.S. goods, including farm and energy commodities and manufactured products, to reduce a U.S. trade deficit with China that it estimates at more than $417 billion for 2018. People familiar with the talks told Reuters the two sides still had substantial work ahead to reach agreement on a way to ensure China follows through on any pledges. Talks could still collapse if a deal cannot be reached on enforcement of these “structural” issues.

12197,"HONG KONG/LONDON   - HSBC warned it may have to delay some investments this year as Europe’s biggest bank missed 2018 profit forecasts due to slowing growth in its two home markets of China and Britain. Its shares fell 3 percent and analysts cut their forecasts as HSBC reported a drop in fourth-quarter revenue amid tumbling stock markets that sapped customer’s confidence in investing. The results spoke to a wider problem for European banks, which are struggling to return to growth after a decade of post-crisis restructuring due to a worsening global economic outlook.       At the end of his first year in charge, Chief Executive John Flint said HSBC may have to delay investment plans in order to avoid missing a key target known as ‘positive jaws’ - which tracks whether the bank is growing revenues faster than costs - for a second straight year. “We will be proactive in managing costs and investment to meet the risks to revenue growth where necessary, but we will not take short-term decisions that harm the long-term interests of the business,” Flint said on Tuesday, after HSBC reported a lower-than-expected 16 percent rise in 2018 profit before tax. In June, Flint had said HSBC would invest $15-$17 billion over three years in areas including technology and China, while keeping profitability and dividend targets little changed.  “The key thing is just to moderate the pace of  investments ... not to cancel it or change the shape of the investments,” Flint told Reuters. The bank said it failed to achieve positive jaws in 2018 due to the weakness of markets in the fourth quarter. A combination of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in former hot spots wiped 10 percent off MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index last year, its first double-digit loss in any year since the 2008 global financial crisis. Flint’s comments come as an economic slowdown in China challenges HSBC’s strategy of pouring more resources into Asia where it already makes nearly 90 percent of its profits. China’s economic growth slowed to 6.6 percent in 2018, the weakest in 28 years, weighed down by rising borrowing costs and a clampdown on riskier lending that starved smaller, private companies of capital and stifled investment. Pressure on the world’s second-largest economy could increase if Beijing and Washington do not reach a deal soon to end their year-long trade dispute, which is taking a growing toll on export-reliant economies from Asia to Europe. HSBC’s profits in Asia grew by 16 percent to $17.8 billion last year, accounting for 89 percent of group profit. “Clearly our customers are really more cautious and are more thoughtful around this trade war with the U.S.,” Flint said. “It’s possible that we’ll see a slightly lower growth rate this year but we are still going to see a growth rate.” Since taking over from Stuart Gulliver last February, Flint has largely stuck to the same China-focused strategy as his predecessor while attempting to revive HSBC’s ailing U.S. franchise and putting less emphasis on its investment bank. HSBC set aside $165 million against possible future bad loans in Britain, which it said reflected the increased risks of a potential economic hit from Britain’s departure from the European Union, scheduled for next month. HSBC joined UK peer Royal Bank of Scotland in warning that uncertainties related to Brexit could also drive businesses under. “The longer we have the uncertainty the worse it’s going to be for the customers. Customers are absolutely postponing investment decisions ... and that’s been the part of this slowdown that we have seen in the UK,” Flint said. HSBC reported a profit before tax of $19.9 billion for 2018, versus $17.2 billion the year before, but below an average estimate of $22 billion, according to Refinitiv data based on forecasts from 17 analysts. The bank said it would pay a full-year dividend of $0.51 per share, roughly in line with analysts’ expectations. HSBC was confident of maintaining the dividend at this level, it said. The bank’s core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, fell to 14 percent at the end of December from 14.5 percent at the end of 2017, mainly due to adverse foreign exchange movements.

12268,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON   - The United States and China will resume trade talks next week in Washington with time running short to ease their bruising trade war, but U.S. President Donald Trump repeated on Friday that he may extend a March 1 deadline for a deal and keep tariffs on Chinese goods from rising. Both the United States and China reported progress in five days of negotiations in Beijing this week. Trump, speaking at a White House news conference, said the United States was closer than ever before to “having a real trade deal” with China and said he would be “honored” to remove tariffs if an agreement can be reached. But he added that the talks were “very complicated.” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Friday the two economic superpowers “will continue working on all outstanding issues in advance of the March 1, 2019, deadline.  “These detailed and intensive discussions led to progress between the two parties. Much work remains, however,” Sanders said about the Beijing talks. She added that the two countries agreed to state any commitments they make in a memorandum of understanding. China’s Vice Premier and chief trade negotiator Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would be leading the talks in Washington, a White House source said. U.S. duties on $200 billion in imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no deal is reached by March 1 to address U.S. demands that China curb forced technology transfers and better enforce intellectual property rights.  Trump, asked whether he would grant Beijing a 60-day extension to the deadline, said: “There is a possibility that I will extend the date. But if I do that - if I see that we’re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction - I would do that at the same tariffs that we’re charging now, I would not increase the tariffs.” Trump also said he would consider bringing top U.S. Democrats - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer - into the final stages of the talks to minimize their dissent with the deal. Spokespersons for the two lawmakers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The conclusion of the Beijing talks prompted optimism on Wall Street, where major stock indexes ended higher. The U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies doing business in China, applauded the announcement that the two sides would put specific language in a memorandum of understanding and said its existence could cause the Trump to push back deadline. “It does appear that enough progress has been made to possibly extend the deadline,” said Craig Allen, president of the Washington-based group. “The memorandum of understanding might not finish all the details, but if it contained the final picture ... that would be a huge step forward.” Chinese state news agency Xinhua said on Friday that China and the United States had reached a “consensus in principle” on some key issues, adding they had a detailed discussion on a memorandum of understanding on trade and economic issues. It gave no details. The countries focused this week on technology, intellectual property rights, agriculture, services, non-tariff barriers and currency, and discussed potential Chinese purchases of U.S. goods and services to reduce a “large and persistent bilateral trade deficit,” Sanders said.  Chinese President Xi Jinping met Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday after a week of talks at senior and deputy levels, and called for a deal both sides could accept, Chinese state media said. After talks on Thursday, Mnuchin said on Twitter that he and Lighthizer had held “productive meetings” with Xi’s top economic adviser, Liu He.  “The consultations between the two sides’ teams achieved important step-by-step progress,” Xi said, according to state television. “I hope you will continue efforts to advance reaching a mutually beneficial, win-win agreement,” Xi said at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. He added that China was willing to take a “cooperative approach” to settling bilateral trade frictions. Lighthizer told Xi the senior officials had “two very good days” of talks.  “We feel that we have made headway on very, very important, and very difficult issues. We have additional work to do but we are hopeful,” Lighthizer told Xi in a pool video shown to foreign media. Neither country has offered new details on how they might de-escalate the tariff war that has roiled financial markets and disrupted manufacturing supply chains. Although Trump said this week that an extension of the tariff deadline was possible if a “real deal” was close, Larry Kudlow, director of the U.S. National Economic Council, has said the White House had made no such decision.  But several sources informed about the meetings told Reuters there was little indication negotiators had made major progress on sticking points to pave the way for a potential meeting between Xi and Trump in coming weeks to hammer out a deal. “Stalemate on the important stuff,” said one source. All of the sources requested anonymity because the talks are confidential.  “There’s still a lot of distance between parties on structural and enforcement issues,” said a second source. “I wouldn’t quite call it hitting a wall, but it’s not a field of dreams either.” A third source told Reuters the White House was “irate” over earlier reports that the Trump administration was considering a 60-day extension of the tariff deadline.

12289,"NEW YORK   - Wall Street rallied on Friday, with the Dow and the Nasdaq posting their eighth consecutive weekly gains as investors grew hopeful that the United States and China would hammer out an agreement resolving their protracted trade war. All three major U.S. indexes ended the session higher, and for the fourth straight session, the S&P 500 held above its 200-day moving average, a key technical level. Talks between the United States and China will resume in Washington next week, with both sides saying progress has been made toward resolving the two countries’ contentious trade dispute. Tariff-vulnerable industrials provided the biggest lift to the blue-chip Dow, led by bellwethers Boeing Co, 3M Co, United Technologies Inc and Caterpillar Inc. “This may be just false hope with the tariff situation as thorny details still need to be agreed upon,” said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. “It’s good news but its not over yet.” Indeed, the trade row’s effects were reflected in Deere & Co’s earnings report, which came in below analyst estimates in part because of slowing international trade. The agricultural equipment manufacturer’s shares fell 2.1 percent. “Solving the trade issue could give global growth the boost it needs,” Carter added. “Absent a tariff solution, growth will continue to slow.” With nearly 80 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported, fourth-quarter earnings season is largely in the rearview mirror. Analysts now see a profit increase of 16.2 percent for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Going forward, however, the outlook continues to worsen. First quarter earnings are currently seen falling by 0.5 percent, the first year-on-year decline since mid-2016.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 443.86 points, or 1.74 percent, to 25,883.25, the S&P 500 gained 29.87 points, or 1.09 percent, to 2,775.6 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.46 points, or 0.61 percent, to 7,472.41. All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in the black. The rate-sensitive financial sector led the S&P 500’s advance, bouncing back from Thursday’s sell-off as U.S. Treasury yields crept back up. Shares of PepsiCo were up 3.1 percent even after the snack and beverage company forecast a surprise drop in full-year profit. Nvidia Corp rose 1.8 percent following the company’s forecasts for its current fiscal year topped Wall Street expectations. The chipmaker gave the second-largest boost to the closely-watched Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index, which was up 0.5 percent. The index has jumped nearly 18 percent so far this year. Amazon.com shares were down 0.9 percent after scrapping its plans for a New York headquarters. In fact, each of Amazon’s fellow FAANG members, a group of momentum stocks which also includes Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc also ended the session in the red.

12319,"LONDON   - The world economy is caught in a “delicate equilibrium” between stabilization and a further downturn, according to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, and that balance could look even shakier over the next few days. Early measures of factory activity from Asia, Europe and the United States – which typically give signals of momentum in the overall economy - will be scrutinized by investors, many of whom fear that the sudden weakness of late 2018 is intensifying. Trade tensions have weighed heavily on factories around the world, something that is likely to be high on the minds of negotiators from the United States and China when they resume their talks to avert an escalation of their tariff war. Things looked very different a year ago. The world economy seemed to have finally kicked into a higher gear, nearly a decade after the financial crisis of 2007-08, with all regions joining in the upswing. But a combination of U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive stance on trade and worries about the impact of central banks raising interest rates - the U.S. Federal Reserve increased borrowing costs four times in 2018 - has raised fears that the world could be heading back into recession. Carney, in a speech on Feb. 12, said he believed growth was likely to stabilize at its new slower pace, helped by central banks scaling back their plans for removing the massive levels of stimulus they have held in place for a decade. “But this is a judgment, not a guarantee. The world is in a delicate equilibrium,” Carney warned. The most recent signs from the world economy have not been promising. U.S. retail sales for December were far weaker than expected and Germany avoided a recession by the narrowest of margins. Britain - weighed down by the uncertainty about Brexit as well as the global weakness - is heading for its slowest year of growth since 2009, according to the BoE, while China’s economic growth last year was the weakest in 28 years. In the next few days, a string of surveys of manufacturing will give a fresher sense of whether the slowdown of last year is dissipating or getting worse. Purchasing manager indexes (PMIs) for the euro zone, the United States and Japan are due on Feb. 21 and there will be other measures of factory output in the form of U.S. durable goods data and industrial orders in Japan and Italy. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit which publishes the PMIs, said that in late 2017 only one country’s factory sector - Colombia’s - was shrinking. Now 11 of the 30 countries he covers are contracting, including those in China and Germany, from where problems are rippling out into Asia and eastern Europe respectively. “A lot of the anecdotal evidence that we get is blaming trade wars and tariff worries, and the gloom it is casting over the prospects for the year ahead,” Williamson said. Markit’s global export index had been in decline for five months, highlighting how the slowdown was led by weaker trade, although a slight pick-up in optimism among manufacturers around the world in January offered a hint of hope. Much of that optimism hinges on the chance of the United States and China finding a way to de-escalate their trade war. Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Friday that talks with the United States would continue in the coming days and he hoped the two sides will be able to reach a deal. But many investors want to see more definitive signs that the clouds hanging over the economy really are lifting. Toby Vaughan, chief investment officer with Brown Shipley, a British private bank and wealth management firm, said his team scaled back on equity holdings in October and have not yet raised their exposure back up. “The reality is, none of those factors have really changed. There are some encouraging signs, but it’s headlines and rhetoric with regard to U.S.-China for example,” he said. While Washington and Beijing are sounding positive about their trade stand-off, officials in Europe are worried that the Trump administration is preparing to hit European automobile exports with tariffs, citing national security grounds. “Such a development would likely be taken negatively by markets as it would risk a direct response of tariffs from the EU and a step up in tensions,” economists at ING said in a note to clients. “Businesses and consumers will face higher prices in such a scenario along with the likely disruption to supply chains -

12364,"NEW YORK   - The S&P 500 and the Dow slipped while the Nasdaq posted a slim gain on Thursday as investors struggled to square grim retail sales data with hopes that high-level talks in Beijing could resolve the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute. Paring earlier losses, the S&P 500 held above its 200-day moving average, a key technical level, for the third straight session. All three major U.S. stock indexes were held back by rate-sensitive financial stocks as U.S. Treasury yields fell on the weaker-than-expected economic data.  Talks to defuse the ongoing tariff dispute between the world’s two largest economies moved to a higher level as U.S.-China negotiations progressed in Beijing ahead of the March 1 deadline.  But trade optimism was undercut by a report from the U.S. Commerce Department showing retail sales in December suffered their biggest drop in more than nine years, stoking fears of an economic slowdown.   “The market has been climbing this wall of worry since Christmas,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “Some of that worry might turn into reality, and that’s what’s holding investors back.” “I wouldn’t say there’s a lot of conviction out there,” Ghriskey added.      With the fourth-quarter reporting season now more than three-fourths complete, analysts now see earnings growth of 16.2 percent for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data.  But first-quarter estimates are less favorable. They show a 0.3 percent year-on-year decline, which would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings recession that ended in 2016.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.88 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,439.39, the S&P 500 lost 7.3 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,745.73 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.58 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,426.96. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, 6 closed in negative territory, with consumer staples and financials showing the biggest percentage declines. Cisco Systems Inc rose 1.9 percent on the heels of a better-than-expected earnings report as the network gear maker benefited from strength in newer businesses and shrugged off the impact of the U.S.-China trade war. Shares of American International Group Inc slid 9.0 percent, marking its worst day in four years after the global insurer posted a quarterly loss. Coca-Cola Co shares fizzled, dropping 8.4 percent and providing the biggest drag on the Dow after its full-year profit forecast fell well below Wall Street expectations.

13623,"DAVOS, Switzerland   - As central banks stock up on policy ammunition in the face of a worsening global economic outlook, they are having to reassess one of their most delicate weapons - the ‘forward guidance’ they use to flag their intentions to the markets. Forced to slash borrowing costs, in some cases below zero, to fight the global financial crisis, the big central banks relied heavily on verbal hints and signals to set expectations about the future path of rates. By promising to keep monetary conditions ultra-loose, they hoped to push down longer-term rates and spur growth. A decade on, they are again grappling for the right language as they wind down crisis-era measures while still facing an array of daunting risks, from the U.S.-China trade war to Brexit and slowing global growth. Conditions have not deteriorated to the point where central banks need to ponder reverting to extreme measures. The Fed can pause its rate hike cycle, the European Central Bank can go slow in raising rates and the Bank of Japan feels maintaining its current stimulus will be enough. But policymakers gathering in Davos for the World Economic Forum this week - including central bank chiefs Haruhiko Kuroda of Japan and Mark Carney of Britain - will be taking a hard look at what ammunition they have left to battle the next economic downturn. While shrugging off fears of an imminent global recession, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde warned policymakers on Monday to brace for a “serious slowdown” as trade protectionism, higher tariffs and financial market turbulence darken the outlook. “After two years of solid expansion, the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising,” Lagarde told reporters in Davos after the global lender cut its estimates for global economic growth this year and next. [L1N1ZL0BZ] The U.S. Federal Reserve has been weaning itself off forward guidance as it dials back crisis-mode policies, removing last year a phrase that policy will stay “accommodative” for some time. But other central banks, notably the BOJ, have been forced to maintain or even strengthen forward guidance to make up for a lack of alternative tools. Compared with other options, this  has the advantage that it only requires tweaking language. While central banks may eventually turn to radical means like quantitative easing (QE), depending on the severity of the situation, they could prepare such steps or complement them with forward guidance to buy time or maximize the stimulus effect. “Policymakers at both the Fed and the ECB will want to keep forward guidance as a tool of monetary stimulus in future,” said Mansoor Mohi-uddin, Macro Strategist at NatWest Markets. The BOJ could be among the major central banks most reliant on forward guidance. Already owning half of Japan’s government bond market, there are limits to how much more QE it can do. Rate cuts are also controversial as years of ultra-low rates have narrowed financial institutions’ margins, enough to draw concerns within the BOJ of the rising cost of prolonged easing. The BOJ could thus consider offering stronger forward guidance, such as binding itself to keep interest rates at current ultra-low levels until inflation approaches 2 percent, if it were to ramp up stimulus again, say sources familiar with the central bank’s thinking. “It’s definitely among tools the BOJ will consider when the economy is hit by a big shock,” one of the sources said, a view echoed by two other sources. Forward guidance could also come in handy for the ECB, as reverting to QE would be difficult given it has essentially run out of bonds to buy within its self-imposed role. The ECB has pledged to keep its deposit rate at minus 0.4 percent at least until the summer of 2019 but does not provide guidance beyond that. The likely response to any further economic slowdown would be to push out rate hike expectations even further, a relatively easy move. “Interest rate cuts and quantitative easing will likely remain the main instruments for reviving demand when the next recession strikes,” said Mohi-uddin of NatWest Markets. There is debate, however, on how well central bankers could steer market expectations without confusing investors. ECB President Mario Draghi sent bond yields soaring in September last year when he talked about a “vigorous” inflation rise, sparking expectations of an imminent lift-off. BOJ Governor Kuroda also jolted markets in late 2017 when he spoke of a “reversal rate,” or the rate at which the cost of easing exceeds the benefits, stoking fears his central bank would soon dial back stimulus. Market expectations on the Fed’s policy path whip-sawed after its chairman Jerome Powell gave conflicting signs on how quickly the Fed would hike rates and shrink its balance sheet. Striking the right balance between transparency and flexibility has also always been tricky. “Forward guidance is effective at times but not always. It needs to be realistic and credible. That’s not easy,” said Kazuo Momma, executive economist at Mizuho Research Institute and a former senior BOJ official with experience of drafting monetary policy. “It’s pretty hard to deal with various situations by forward guidance alone. If it’s too ambiguous, it doesn’t have punch. But if you’re too clear, the guidance could bind future policy.” Former BOJ board member Sayuri Shirai, who has worked with the IMF, said central banks need to be more creative on how to maximize the effect of forward guidance. “Forward guidance was effective after the Lehman crisis because it was something new and surprised people,” she said. “Now, everyone got used to it. That raises the hurdle for central banks to make forward guidance work.” Davos influence graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2HgY4lx ","As outlook darkens, central banks think hard about their language","January 21,

13667," (This Jan 18 story was refiled to delete extraneous wording in paragraph 15) By Michael Martina and Chris Prentice BEIJING/WASHINGTON   - The United States is pushing for regular reviews of China’s progress on pledged trade reforms as a condition for a trade deal - and could again resort to tariffs if it deems Beijing has violated the agreement, according to sources briefed on negotiations to end the trade war between the two nations. A continuing threat of tariffs hanging over commerce between the world’s two largest economies would mean a deal would not end the risk of investing in businesses or assets that have been impacted by the trade war. “The threat of tariffs is not going away, even if there is a deal,” said one of three sources briefed on the talks who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity. Chinese negotiators were not keen on the idea of regular compliance checks, the source said, but the U.S. proposal “didn’t derail negotiations.” A Chinese source said the United States wants “periodic assessments” but it’s not yet clear how often. “It looks like humiliation,” the source said. “But perhaps the two sides could find a way to save face for the Chinese government.” The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed import tariffs on Chinese goods to put pressure on Beijing to meet a long list of demands that would rewrite the terms of trade between the two countries.  The demands include changes to China’s policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other trade barriers. An enforcement and verification process is unusual for trade deals and is akin to the process around punitive economic sanctions such as those imposed on North Korea and Iran. Disputes over trade are more typically dealt with through courts, the World Trade Organization (WTO) or through arbitration panels and other dispute settlement mechanisms built into trade agreements. Trump’s team has criticized the WTO for failing to hold China accountable for not executing on promised market reforms. The U.S. has also criticized the WTO’s dispute settlement process and is seeking reforms at the organization. (For an explainer on how the U.S.-China talks differ from any other trade negotiation, see: ) Regular reviews would be one potential solution to address a demand from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for ongoing verification of any trade pact between the two countries, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters. The threat of tariffs would be used to keep reform on track, the sources said. Lighthizer is leading negotiations with China. A USTR spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of regular assessments. The idea of quarterly reviews was part of a U.S. negotiating document leaked after talks in May 2018, before the United States had slapped its first round of duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. The renewed focus on regular reviews in current negotiations - this time carrying the threat of tariffs - underscores the growing distrust between the two countries. The extra scrutiny is needed and should be based on clear benchmarks - with consequence for failing to meet them, said Erin Ennis, Senior Vice President of the U.S.-China Business Council, a trade group representing American companies doing business in China. “It needs to be tied to removing or reducing the tariffs,” Ennis said. “If China can show compliance through a process like this, it would also be a trust-building measure for both sides.”  Trump’s administration has accused China of repeatedly failing to follow through on previous pledges to implement reforms sought by the United States. Washington often cites as an example the difficulties still faced by foreign payment card operators in entering China’s market despite a 2012 WTO ruling that Beijing was discriminating against them. A separate industry source said it is likely that different agreement on separate issues - forced technology transfer, intellectual property, changes to China’s legal system - would require separate verification processes, all of which will need to be hammered out by negotiators. “The challenge of verification and enforcement stems from the fact that China has made promises it hasn’t kept,” the source said. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce in the trade war in December to give their teams time to negotiate a deal. Nearly 50 days later, there is little sign that China will make the concessions the U.S. is seeking. Lighthizer saw no progress on structural issues at three days of mid-level talks in Beijing last week, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said on Tuesday. China’s Vice Premier and lead negotiator Liu He is due to visit Washington for the next round of talks with Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the end of the month.

14148,"  - Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which slashed its quarterly sales forecast last week, has reduced planned production for its three new iPhone models by about 10 percent for the January-March quarter, the Nikkei Asian Review reported on Wednesday. That rare forecast cut exposed weakening iPhone demand in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market, where a slowing economy has also been buffeted by a trade war with the United States. Many analysts and consumers have said the new iPhones are overpriced. Apple asked its suppliers late last month to produce fewer-than-planned units of its XS, XS Max and XR models, the Nikkei reported, citing sources with knowledge of the request.  The request was made before Apple announced its forecast cut, the Nikkei said. The bleaker sales outlook, which Apple attributed to weak China demand, triggered a broad sell-off in global stock markets. Market research firm Canalys estimates shipments fell 12 percent in China last year and expects smartphone shipments in 2019 to dip another 3 percent, to below 400 million for the first time since 2014. Overall planned production volume of both old and new iPhones is likely to be cut to a range of 40 million to 43 million units for January-March period, from an earlier projection of 47 million to 48 million units, the Nikkei reported, citing one source familiar with the situation. Apple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The report comes after chip suppliers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS.O) flagged weak first-quarter chip demand for smartphones. Samsung surprised the market on Tuesday with an estimated 29 percent drop in quarterly profit, blaming weak chip demand in a rare commentary issued to “ease confusion” among investors already fretting about a global tech slowdown. Apple’s iPhone suppliers include Taiwanese assemblers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) (2317.TW) and Pegatron Corp (4938.TW). Pegatron declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters, while Foxconn did not reply to a request for comment. There was little reaction to the report among shares of major Apple suppliers, as the market has already digested production cuts after the iPhone maker’s forecast cut, analysts said. Shares of Foxconn, the world’s biggest electronics contract manufacturer, closed up 1.6 percent, while Pegatron closed up 1.3 percent. Apple shares were up 1.3 percent at $152.70 in early trading on Wednesday. Among iPhone component suppliers in Asia, South Korea’s LG Display Co Ltd (034220.KS) closed up 0.5 percent, while Japan Display Inc (6740.T) was flat. “The Street is already well aware of a soft March guide so this latest report is not a new worry, as investors are starting to look ahead 6-9 months down the road for Apple and gauge how the company emerges from this dark chapter of soft demand,” Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said. As Chinese demand has faltered, Apple has increased focus on India, which recently overtook the United States as the world’s second-largest smartphone market.
