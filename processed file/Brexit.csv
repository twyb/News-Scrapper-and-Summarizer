1,"Boris Johnson’s 31 October “do or die” Brexit deadline appears to be out of reach. At Wednesday’s meeting with Jeremy Corbyn – and the pair’s chief advisers, Dominic Cummings and Seumas Milne, respectively – the government side expressed the hope that a new timetable could be agreed in time to leave by Halloween.Cummings reportedly indicated that MPs should be prepared to sit through the night, if that was what it would take.Boris Johnson has three options to try and call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and 9 September and failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Johnson could try this again and potentially secure Labour backing, because the Benn act has removed the imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit.This lowers the threshold of MPs needed to trigger a general election because it requires a simple majority to pass. This could work in Johnson’s favour. However, it is amendable, which can involve the moving of an election date to a time that works for the opposition. The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, can call a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. This needs a simple majority to pass. He has been urged to do this by Johnson several times as a way of triggering an election, but Corbyn has resisted. It begins a 14-day period in which either the prime minister or someone else can try to form a new government. While Johnson could potentially lose this, and therefore his place as prime minister, to another Conservative, Corbyn could also struggle to get enough MPs to rally around him to form a government. The Scottish National party has said it would back him, but the Liberal Democrats have been extremely vocal in saying they would not support him. An election is triggered if, at the end of the two-week period, no alternative government has been formed.Kate Proctor Political correspondentLabour believes meeting the deadline is now impractical, but that an alternative parliamentary timetable could easily be agreed – if the government just lets go of that talismanic date.So the prime minister must decide whether to press ahead with trying to push the withdrawal agreement bill through parliament, and “get Brexit done” before asking MPs to back a general election – or go to the voters now.Some of Johnson’s allies – particularly the bullish Vote Leave veterans inside Downing Street – believe the majority of 30 the government achieved on Tuesday for the second reading of his Brexit bill is as good as it gets.They have watched parliament delay and frustrate efforts to press ahead with Brexit for three years – not least when the Johnson resigned from Theresa May’s cabinet and voted against her deal twice.They fear that many of those 19 Labour MPs who rebelled against Corbyn to vote for the government could easily melt away later in the process. They could also succeed in allying with Conservative (and former Conservative) backbenchers to amend the legislation in ways Johnson, let alone the European Research Group, would find hard to stomach.And they believe Johnson’s moment of maximum electoral appeal may be now: with Labour divided about Brexit tactics, and the bounce of having secured a majority for the deal, albeit just at second reading.There is also the fact that without a majority, it will be extremely difficult for the prime minister to implement many of his policies.If he presses for an election now, Johnson will have to run on a platform of having been blocked by parliament from achieving what he promised to do – and there must be a risk that appears a weakness, not a strength.It may be hard to explain to voters why he didn’t just get on and get Brexit done; and it could open the way to a resurgent Brexit party.As May’s chief of staff, Gavin (now Lord) Barwell, tweeted on Thursday morning, “the Conservative party must be in a better place vs the Brexit party in any campaign if we have actually left”.It wasn’t May’s decision to delay Brexit – but her party was still hammered by Nigel Farage at May’s european elections.And Labour might fare better in an election in which they could focus on their domestic programme – and on promising to negotiate the closest possible trading relationship, and protect the rights and protections that would no longer be underpinned by EU legislation.If the EU27 signs off on the three-month extension as expected, the government could table a motion under the fixed-term parliament act to be voted on early next week.If it secures a two-thirds majority – which appears likely, with Labour preparing to back it – polling day would be five weeks after parliament is dissolved, making it just possible to cram in an election before Christmas.

61,"It’s not over. For a few anxious, or jubilant - depending on which tribe you belong to – minutes between 7.15pm and 7.30pm, it seemed as if the Brexit saga might just be on the verge of resolution, after three and a half agonisingly long years. The House of Commons voted to allow Boris Johnson’s withdrawal agreement bill to advance to the next stage, a prize that had eluded Theresa May not once, not twice, but three times.What’s more, MPs gave it a green light more emphatically than even the most ardent Brexiters had dared hope. While May had been crushed by triple-figure majorities, Johnson won his meaningful vote by 329 to 299 votes, a majority of 30. Put another way, and as if to reflect this divided nation through what have become the defining numbers of the Brexit era, he won by 52% to 48%.For a prime minister who lost his governing majority within days of reaching Downing Street, and who lost six of his first seven votes in the House, this tasted like a rare and substantial victory. All he had to do next was win approval for his accelerated timetable, one that would cram line-by-line scrutiny of a 110-page bill giving legal effect to a 585-page withdrawal agreement, into 48 hours. For a few fleeting, clammy-palmed moments, it seemed as if he might pull it off. The naysayers of the DUP remained in their seats. Did that mean they were they going to abstain, thereby handing Johnson a second win?It did not. They rose and walked through the no lobby, confirmation of their fury at a Tory prime minister who has done what he himself had said no Tory prime minister should ever do – agreeing to separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to such an extent that Northern Irish businesses will need to fill in customs forms to ship goods to their friends and cousins in England, Scotland and Wales. The result was defeat by 322 to 308 – all but 52-to-48 in reverse. Denied his fast track to approval, Johnson announced he was not pulling the bill – as he had threatened – but “pausing” it, as he waited to hear how long an extension the EU would grant to the Hamlet nation across the channel, forever paralysed by indecision.Posing as a man whose determination would not be deflected, Johnson said that we would “definitely be leaving the EU with this deal”. But note what he did not say: he dropped his customary reference to “by October the 31st”. For all the talk of corpses in ditches, and “do or die”, it was that promise that expired this evening.What does it mean? First, don’t fall for the hype that says that parliament approved Johnson’s deal. It did not. MPs simply voted for it to receive a second reading, some of them motivated by the desire not to endorse it but to amend it. As Labour’s Gloria De Piero confessed, she voted yes, “not because I support the deal but because I don’t”. That 30-vote majority will include MPs who wanted to propose UK membership of a customs union, others keen on conditioning the deal on public support in a confirmatory referendum. Screen out the Tory spin: those MPs should not be counted as backers of the deal.As for the defeat on the timetable, that is the result of what now looks like a tactical misjudgment by the government. By making such a fetish of the 31 October deadline – arbitrarily imposed by Emmanuel Macron when Theresa May missed the last one – Johnson painted himself into a corner whereby even a delay of a few days looked like a humiliation. Both Jeremy Corbyn and Ken Clarke signalled that it might not need much more than a few extra days to undertake the necessary scrutiny – though Nikki da Costa, until recently Johnson’s head of legislative affairs, had said it required at least four weeks – which is hardly that long to wait. Instead of taking that pragmatic course, Johnson felt compelled to call the whole thing to a halt.Why? The obvious explanation is that this gives the PM a pretext to grab what he really wants: an early election framed as a battle to get Brexit done, with him as the people’s tribune pitted against those wicked remainer saboteurs.But another explanation suggests itself, too. Any period of scrutiny is unpalatable to Johnson, because he fears that the threadbare coalition that might exist to back his deal will unravel once it engages in closer examination of the withdrawal agreement. Its erosion of workers’ rights; its creation of a new no-deal cliff edge in 2020; its entrenchment of a hard Brexit in law – all those dangers would only become more visible under the spotlight of protracted (or even normal) Commons scrutiny. Bits of his coalition – especially among those Labour MPs who backed him on Tuesday – would begin to flake off.The truth is, Johnson will never have a bigger vote for his deal in this House of Commons than the one he assembled tonight. It will only get smaller. No wonder he had to pause. His next option is to call an election – and gamble that the next parliament will be more forgiving than the last. Either way, we are not free of the Brexit saga yet, not by a long way.• Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",Don't buy the hype: Boris Johnson's Brexit deal did not win

75,"Boris Johnson could see his Brexit legislation amended to require him to negotiate a customs union with the EU, after at least five pro-deal MPs said they would support this option.The MPs – two former Conservatives, Nick Boles and Ken Clarke, plus at least three pro-deal Labour MPs, Melanie Onn, Gareth Snell and Ruth Smeeth – have put their names to a measure giving the government a mandate to negotiate a customs union.The amendment to the Brexit bill would not change the UK’s proposed treaty with the EU, so Johnson has the option of accepting the amendment and then going into an election arguing to overturn it.However, two Tory insiders told the Guardian it would be extremely difficult for Johnson and his Eurosceptic hardliners to accept any mandate for a customs union and it would be more likely for him to pull the bill and seek a general election.Johnson’s chances of passing the EU withdrawal agreement bill through the House of Commons are on a knife-edge.If at least five pro-deal MPs vote for it, then the chances of a customs union amendment passing later this week look fairly high. However, it could hinge on the actions of a handful of independents and the Democratic Unionist party, as well as the Liberal Democrats and SNP who have historically voted for remain and second referendum options rather than soft Brexit ones.Labour has said it will back an amendment in favour of a customs union and accepts that one proposed by backbenchers has the best chance of cross-party success.No 10 said Johnson would not accept a customs union. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, told the BBC now was not the time to discuss Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU and matters such as the customs union.“This is a piece of legislation which simply puts into effect in UK law what the prime minister has managed to negotiate. The critical thing is the future relationship will be subject to a negotiating mandate that will be debated and voted on in the House of Commons,” he said.“Those MPs who have concerns about issues such as that [the burden on businesses sending goods to Northern Ireland] or the customs union ... they will have the ability to discuss and vote on that later on, once we have left the European Union.’Jenrick added: “Those MPs who want to deliver Brexit will be voting with the government today.”",Pro-deal MPs try to force Johnson to seek EU customs union,2019-10-22/13:23:38,boris johnson could see his brexit legislation amended to require him to negotiate a customs union with the eu after at least five pro deal mps said they would support this option the mps two former conservatives nick boles and ken clarke plus at least three pro deal labour mps melanie onn gareth snell and ruth smeeth have put their names to a measure giving the government a mandate to negotiate a customs union the amendment to the brexit bill would not change the uk s proposed treaty with the eu so johnson has the option of accepting the amendment and then going into an election arguing to overturn it however two tory insiders told the guardian it would be extremely difficult for johnson and his eurosceptic hardliners to accept any mandate for a customs union and it would be more likely for him to pull the bill and seek a general election johnson s chances of passing the eu withdrawal agreement bill through the house of commons are on a knife edge if at least five pro deal mps vote for it then the chances of a customs union amendment passing later this week look fairly high however it could hinge on the actions of a handful of independents and the democratic unionist party as well as the liberal democrats and snp who have historically voted for remain and second referendum options rather than soft brexit ones labour has said it will back an amendment in favour of a customs union and accepts that one proposed by backbenchers has the best chance of cross party success no  said johnson would not accept a customs union robert jenrick the communities secretary told the bbc now was not the time to discuss britain s future trading relationship with the eu and matters such as the customs union this is a piece of legislation which simply puts into effect in uk law what the prime minister has managed to negotiate the critical thing is the future relationship will be subject to a negotiating mandate that will be debated and voted on in the house of commons he said those mps who have concerns about issues such as that the burden on businesses sending goods to northern ireland or the customs union they will have the ability to discuss and vote on that later on once we have left the european union jenrick added those mps who want to deliver brexit will be voting with the government today ,Brexit,0.34541285
99,"Sajid Javid has rebuffed MPs’ demands for the Treasury to carry out a thorough economic assessment of the government’s Brexit deal, claiming it is “self-evidently in our economic interest”.The chancellor has written to MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee, which requested a fresh analysis in order to help MPs judge whether to support the deal. Javid suggested ending the uncertainty that has surrounded the issue of Brexit would in itself be beneficial to the economy – and rejected the idea that the government should carry out a new analysis and then make it available to MPs.“My starting point is that agreeing the withdrawal agreement is self-evidently in our economic interest,” he said. “It would bring an end to the damaging uncertainty and delay of the past years and allow businesses to get on with taking decisions, including around recruitment and investment.”The cross-Whitehall economic analysis published last year suggested the economy would be considerably weaker under a free trade agreement (FTA) – the type of relationship targeted under Boris Johnson’s latest deal.But Javid said those forecasts only considered a “generic, ‘average’, FTA, looking at examples from around the world”. He suggested the shape of the UK’s FTA with the EU would only become clear during the course of the negotiations, once Brexit had happened.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “Flying blind on a massive decision on the future of the economy is no way for a government to make recommendations to parliament or make legislation. It’s preposterous behaviour by the chancellor and this government.”Independent analysis by the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank suggested Johnson’s plan would knock between 2.3% to 7% off GDP over the next decade, compared with remaining in the EU. The equivalent estimates for Theresa May’s deal were 1.9% to 5.5%.But in stark contrast to the cautious stance associated with his predecessor Philip Hammond, who was referred to by colleagues as “Spreadsheet Phil”, Javid played down the importance of economic forecasts for judging the value of the Brexit deal.“Trust in democracy, and bringing an end to the division that has characterised this debate over the past three years, is something that cannot be measured solely through spreadsheets or impact assessments, important though they are,” he wrote. “Respecting the referendum and closing this chapter so we can focus on delivering growth, and the public services people deserve, is the right thing to do for our country.”Anand Menon, the director of UK in a Changing Europe, said: “It is a shame that the chancellor seems to feel that evidence is now superfluous to good policy making. Self evidently there is more at stake here than just economics. That being said, surely we deserve to know the different potential implications of different kinds of Brexit?”Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “The chancellor is right to say lots of other things will affect what the economic outcome for Britain is. But what is true is that every major study done inside or outside government shows that a looser relationship with the EU, as envisaged in this agreement, leads to a smaller economy than it would otherwise be.”The full text of the withdrawal agreement bill, which the government hopes to rush through parliament in order to leave the EU on 31 October, is expected to be published on Monday evening.Javid is due to hold a budget on 6 November, if Brexit goes ahead next week, and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will then present updated economic forecasts, though it is unclear whether they have enough time to analyse the details of the Johnson deal.In the Commons, Labour’s Ian Murray said he was unable to answer his constituents who ask about the impact Johnson’s deal would have on their finances because the Government is “refusing to publish an economic impact assessment”. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay replied: “The answer is to listen to the Bank of England governor who says that getting this deal passed will be a boost to our economy.” Catherine McKinnell, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne North, said MPs were being “left in the dark” about the economic impact of the new Brexit deal. Responding, Barclay said: “The reality is that any modelling for the future would have to take on board what is the future direction of the (EU) Commission under the new leadership, it would have to consider what actions the UK Government would take in response.” ",Sajid Javid refuses to assess economic dangers of Brexit plan,2019-10-21/18:06:35,sajid javid has rebuffed mps demands for the treasury to carry out a thorough economic assessment of the government s brexit deal claiming it is self evidently in our economic interest the chancellor has written to mps on the cross party treasury select committee which requested a fresh analysis in order to help mps judge whether to support the deal javid suggested ending the uncertainty that has surrounded the issue of brexit would in itself be beneficial to the economy and rejected the idea that the government should carry out a new analysis and then make it available to mps my starting point is that agreeing the withdrawal agreement is self evidently in our economic interest he said it would bring an end to the damaging uncertainty and delay of the past years and allow businesses to get on with taking decisions including around recruitment and investment the cross whitehall economic analysis published last year suggested the economy would be considerably weaker under a free trade agreement fta the type of relationship targeted under boris johnson s latest deal but javid said those forecasts only considered a generic average fta looking at examples from around the world he suggested the shape of the uk s fta with the eu would only become clear during the course of the negotiations once brexit had happened john mcdonnell the shadow chancellor said flying blind on a massive decision on the future of the economy is no way for a government to make recommendations to parliament or make legislation it s preposterous behaviour by the chancellor and this government independent analysis by the uk in a changing europe thinktank suggested johnson s plan would knock between   to  off gdp over the next decade compared with remaining in the eu the equivalent estimates for theresa may s deal were   to   but in stark contrast to the cautious stance associated with his predecessor philip hammond who was referred to by colleagues as spreadsheet phil javid played down the importance of economic forecasts for judging the value of the brexit deal trust in democracy and bringing an end to the division that has characterised this debate over the past three years is something that cannot be measured solely through spreadsheets or impact assessments important though they are he wrote respecting the referendum and closing this chapter so we can focus on delivering growth and the public services people deserve is the right thing to do for our country anand menon the director of uk in a changing europe said it is a shame that the chancellor seems to feel that evidence is now superfluous to good policy making self evidently there is more at stake here than just economics that being said surely we deserve to know the different potential implications of different kinds of brexit torsten bell the director of the resolution foundation thinktank said the chancellor is right to say lots of other things will affect what the economic outcome for britain is but what is true is that every major study done inside or outside government shows that a looser relationship with the eu as envisaged in this agreement leads to a smaller economy than it would otherwise be the full text of the withdrawal agreement bill which the government hopes to rush through parliament in order to leave the eu on  october is expected to be published on monday evening javid is due to hold a budget on  november if brexit goes ahead next week and the independent office for budget responsibility will then present updated economic forecasts though it is unclear whether they have enough time to analyse the details of the johnson deal in the commons labour s ian murray said he was unable to answer his constituents who ask about the impact johnson s deal would have on their finances because the government is refusing to publish an economic impact assessment brexit secretary stephen barclay replied the answer is to listen to the bank of england governor who says that getting this deal passed will be a boost to our economy catherine mckinnell labour mp for newcastle upon tyne north said mps were being left in the dark about the economic impact of the new brexit deal responding barclay said the reality is that any modelling for the future would have to take on board what is the future direction of the eu commission under the new leadership it would have to consider what actions the uk government would take in response ,Brexit,0.178396806
140,"Granted, Brexit is driving everyone mad. We Brits owe all our European friends a sincere apology, a bottle of whisky and complimentary tickets to a Royal Shakespeare Company performance of Hamlet. For Britain is now Hamlet, forever agonising over whether Brexit is to be or not to be.So I can perfectly understand why Europeans such as French president Emmanuel Macron just want to be shot of us, so as to push ahead with an important, ambitious agenda for the whole European Union. Nonetheless, it remains in Europe’s own enlightened, long-term interest to go the extra kilometre. This means, concretely, that if the British parliament does not approve Boris Johnson’s new deal this week, the EU should offer an article 50 extension, as formally requested in the letter sent (though childishly not signed) by Johnson.I offer four arguments for this, all made from the point of view of the EU and Europe as a whole. First, a no-deal Brexit would be hugely damaging to Ireland and other parts of Europe geographically close to the UK. The amendment proposed by the independent Conservative Oliver Letwin and passed by parliament on Saturday is intended, above all, to preclude no deal. Letwin himself has said he will vote for Johnson’s deal, if it comes through parliament in the correct legal form and subject to proper scrutiny.Second, there is the question of who takes the blame. We know from a leaked document that the Johnson team of hard Brexiteers were preparing to blame any failure to get a deal on the “crazy” intransigence of Brussels. If, however, Macron were to make an unholy alliance with Johnson to push Britain out of the door on 31 October, then my side of the Brexit argument – the 3R side: for referendum, remain and reform – would be bound to place part of the blame on our European partners. At the moment, the EU has got itself in exactly the right position: it has showed sufficient firmness to defend the interests of Ireland and the single market, and sufficient flexibility to make any accusation of a punitive “Versailles” treaty completely implausible. For example, the EU breached its own red lines in reopening the withdrawal agreement, to make possible the new deal. It’s important that the EU stays in this sweet spot.Third, it would be better for the long-term future of Europe if the UK stayed in the EU. There is no good outcome to Brexit, but the least worst way forward is for Britain to vote in a second referendum to remain. And the best way to achieve that is for parliament to vote for Johnson’s deal but subject to a confirmatory referendum in which the British public would be asked to make a binding, final decision on a single, clear question: do you want Britain to leave the EU on the terms negotiated by this government, or do you want it to stay in the EU? To be or not to be.Since this government is dominated by hard Brexiteers – and what is envisaged in the new deal is a hard Brexit for England, Wales and Scotland, with a softer one only for Northern Ireland – no leave voter could plausibly complain they were only being offered the choice between a flaccid Brino (Brexit in Name Only) and staying in the EU. Hundreds of thousands rallied outside parliament on Saturday to show their support for such a people’s vote. Even more important than the activists are the opinion polls that now persistently show a majority for remain. How absurd it would be if the UK was to leave the EU, in the name of respecting “the will of the people”, at precisely the moment when the will of the people had changed.I know that many continental European friends who were once sympathetic to a second referendum now think the EU would be better off without us. But if Britain leaves now, it will take another five years to work out what the new economic relationship with the EU will be and whether Scotland will leave the United Kingdom, and then a further five years to see how all this beds down in practice. By that time, the EU and what is left of the UK will certainly have diverged. Britain will be worse off economically than it might have been, but probably not so badly off that stubborn English voters, in particular, would swiftly choose to return. If Brexit goes badly for the UK, that will ensure a thoroughly unhappy and bad-tempered relationship across the Channel, negatively affecting the vital cooperation on foreign and security policy.If, against the odds, Brexit goes well for Britannia, then nationalist populists like Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, the Italian Matteo Salvini and France’s Marine Le Pen will start to say, in those immortal words from the movie When Harry Met Sally: “I’ll have what she’s having.” Either way, it’s bad for the European Union.And there’s a fourth argument that should clinch the case. At the moment, Europe is the last best hope of a values-based west, standing up for democracy and the rule of law. Confronted with the demolition of liberal democracy in EU member states such as Hungary, this is one of the most important tasks for the next chapter of EU history, with new leadership in all European institutions, a freshly elected European parliament and a seven-year budget to be agreed.Prominent among the European leaders crowding round to congratulate Johnson after the deal was done last week was Orbán – he and Johnson are brothers under the skin. Johnson’s schoolboy manoeuvre of sending an unsigned, photocopied letter requesting an extension (as mandated by the so-called Benn act), together with a signed one encouraging the EU to refuse that request, shows just how contemptuous he is of a law passed by Britain’s sovereign parliament. Although his lawyers probably ensured that his conduct did not violate the letter of the law, it certainly violated the spirit of the law.Fortunately, the checks and balances of British liberal democracy are working. In a magnificent, muscular verdict, the supreme court found that Johnson acted unlawfully in trying to prorogue parliament for five weeks. And on Saturday, a democratically elected parliament once again took back control from a bullying executive, to ensure proper scrutiny of a hastily made deal which has epochal implications for both Britain and Europe. Whether this ends with a confirmatory referendum, as I hope, or with a general election, which seems more likely – or with parliament narrowly approving Johnson’s deal, which I would lament but accept – it will be a lawful, democratic process. And a lawful, democratic process is something Europe should always support, even if it takes a little longer.• Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnist. His latest book is Free Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected World","Europe is fed up with Brexit, but it’s still best for all if Britain stays in",2019-10-20/17:30:39,granted brexit is driving everyone mad we brits owe all our european friends a sincere apology a bottle of whisky and complimentary tickets to a royal shakespeare company performance of hamlet for britain is now hamlet forever agonising over whether brexit is to be or not to be so i can perfectly understand why europeans such as french president emmanuel macron just want to be shot of us so as to push ahead with an important ambitious agenda for the whole european union nonetheless it remains in europe s own enlightened long term interest to go the extra kilometre this means concretely that if the british parliament does not approve boris johnson s new deal this week the eu should offer an article  extension as formally requested in the letter sent though childishly not signed by johnson i offer four arguments for this all made from the point of view of the eu and europe as a whole first a no deal brexit would be hugely damaging to ireland and other parts of europe geographically close to the uk the amendment proposed by the independent conservative oliver letwin and passed by parliament on saturday is intended above all to preclude no deal letwin himself has said he will vote for johnson s deal if it comes through parliament in the correct legal form and subject to proper scrutiny second there is the question of who takes the blame we know from a leaked document that the johnson team of hard brexiteers were preparing to blame any failure to get a deal on the crazy intransigence of brussels if however macron were to make an unholy alliance with johnson to push britain out of the door on  october then my side of the brexit argument the r side for referendum remain and reform would be bound to place part of the blame on our european partners at the moment the eu has got itself in exactly the right position it has showed sufficient firmness to defend the interests of ireland and the single market and sufficient flexibility to make any accusation of a punitive versailles treaty completely implausible for example the eu breached its own red lines in reopening the withdrawal agreement to make possible the new deal it s important that the eu stays in this sweet spot third it would be better for the long term future of europe if the uk stayed in the eu there is no good outcome to brexit but the least worst way forward is for britain to vote in a second referendum to remain and the best way to achieve that is for parliament to vote for johnson s deal but subject to a confirmatory referendum in which the british public would be asked to make a binding final decision on a single clear question do you want britain to leave the eu on the terms negotiated by this government or do you want it to stay in the eu to be or not to be since this government is dominated by hard brexiteers and what is envisaged in the new deal is a hard brexit for england wales and scotland with a softer one only for northern ireland no leave voter could plausibly complain they were only being offered the choice between a flaccid brino brexit in name only and staying in the eu hundreds of thousands rallied outside parliament on saturday to show their support for such a people s vote even more important than the activists are the opinion polls that now persistently show a majority for remain how absurd it would be if the uk was to leave the eu in the name of respecting the will of the people at precisely the moment when the will of the people had changed i know that many continental european friends who were once sympathetic to a second referendum now think the eu would be better off without us but if britain leaves now it will take another five years to work out what the new economic relationship with the eu will be and whether scotland will leave the united kingdom and then a further five years to see how all this beds down in practice by that time the eu and what is left of the uk will certainly have diverged britain will be worse off economically than it might have been but probably not so badly off that stubborn english voters in particular would swiftly choose to return if brexit goes badly for the uk that will ensure a thoroughly unhappy and bad tempered relationship across the channel negatively affecting the vital cooperation on foreign and security policy if against the odds brexit goes well for britannia then nationalist populists like hungarian prime minister viktor orbán the italian matteo salvini and france s marine le pen will start to say in those immortal words from the movie when harry met sally i ll have what she s having either way

234,"There is a real risk that the coming general election could be the United Kingdom’s last – with Boris Johnson remembered only for being its last Conservative prime minister. Johnson’s deal is, we now know, even more fatally flawed than Theresa May’s in vital respects: it threatens to make Ireland a smugglers’ and tax avoiders’ paradise and ushers in a race to the bottom in social and environmental standards. All Labour MPs must vote against it. The deal also threatens to Balkanise Britain. Northern Ireland is, for example, exempted from the evil consequences of a US-UK trade deal – from the entry of chlorinated chicken to the contracting out of NHS services – while Scotland, Wales and England would be bound in.By the way he has chosen to resolve one source of division, the Northern Ireland border, Johnson appears hellbent on creating another that nationalists are already seeking to exploit. He is jeopardising, perhaps to the point of its destruction, Scotland’s 300-year-old union with England and thus the very existence of the UK.The extremes now before us – the Johnson deal and an equally hardline 'revoke' – will only exacerbate bitter divisionsSo the looming exit is shaping up not as the Dunkirk moment imagined by Brexiteers, with the whole country coming together as one, rolling up its sleeves and glorying in isolation as, united, it faces the foe. Instead it looks like D-day in reverse: a divided, broken-down country retreating from the Europe it once helped to save; and instead of taking control of its future, losing control to the point that it may no longer be able to hold itself together. So when parliament meets on Saturday, the central issue is no longer just what kind of Brexit we have, but what kind of Britain we want to become – and whether there is to be a Britain at all. And the question each party has to ask is: what will it take to heal the wounds of a country now so rent asunder that it qualifies as having many of the features of a failed state?If the debate on Saturday, and in the coming election campaign, fixates on the two extremes now before us – the Johnson deal and an equally hardline “revoke” – we will only exacerbate our bitter divisions. Just as the Conservatives now discount the views of the 16.1 million who voted remain, so too the Liberal Democrats’ plan to nullify the 2016 referendum without a further peoples’ vote dismisses the concerns of the 17.4 million who voted leave. So it falls to Labour – a remain party that has always acknowledged the real anxieties of leave voters – to set out a path to reunite Britain. The current position of negotiating a better leave package and following it with a second referendum should be updated in the light of Johnson’s existential challenge to the UK. Labour must now propose – and recommend – a renegotiated remain option as well before giving the British people the final say.There were, of course, many concerns raised in 2016 by Brexit voters: the state of our manufacturing and our industrial towns and a general feeling that our politicians had let us down and lost the plot in the post-imperial era. But the central demands of Brexiteers – directly relevant to our EU membership – were to take back control of our borders and our laws. These demands can now be seen in a new light. In their 2016 negotiations the Conservatives failed – whether out of ignorance, idleness or simply sheer stupidity – to examine in detail the national freedoms already exercised by the Germans, French, Italians and others within EU law. We were, and still are, free to make new choices.First, it is possible to regain more control of our borders. We could do as Germany does: register migrant workers as they arrive; or, as Belgium does, impose a time limit on any stay without work. In high-unemployment areas, new jobs could first be advertised at local job centres, as in Switzerland. And to stop unfair labour-market competition, whereby the good employer is undercut by the bad, and the bad by the worst, we could end, as France has done since 2016, the practice of “social dumping” and embrace the new German proposal for a European-wide minimum wage. All these objectives are implementable within the general EU principles of freedom of movement alongside enhanced social and environmental rights.Second, we can ease worries that we have lost control of our laws. We can take more control of our laws in a manner consistent with EU law through domestic legal reform which guarantees the supremacy of the UK constitution. To establish immediate constitutional protections, parliament can issue a “sovereignty declaration” which affirms the UK’s commitment to preserving its constitutional identity in its application of EU law. It could then pass a “sovereignty statute” to guarantee the supremacy of the UK constitution. All this is totally consistent with article 4 (2) of the treaty of Lisbon which requires the EU to respect “national identities”.So there is a reformed remain offer readily available that I am confident Europe will accept, and which puts not just a botched Brexit – with all its angst, idiocy, and grave economic risks – behind us, but also rejects revoke as a pseudo-solution. Instead we can move ahead confidently, renegotiating – not from weakness, but from strength – a bold new plan to make Europe work for Britain.For, as this week’s events have demonstrated, it is the ultimate destiny of Britain that will be on the ballot paper when next we vote: whether under a government that looks more and more like the rump of a once national party, we are to be an inward-looking, anti-immigrant, intolerant country, intoxicated by isolation and fragmented by four nationalisms; or whether we are to emerge as a Britain that is outward-looking, tolerant, inclusive and pragmatic, renewing our character as a multinational state, and once again an engaged and visionary leader on the European and the world stage.• Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to

316,"Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, has claimed “the votes are now there” for Boris Johnson to pass a Brexit deal through parliament.Rees-Mogg, a close ally of Johnson, who is responsible for legislation in the Commons, made the bold claim on the radio station LBC, despite the fact the prime minister is yet to secure a deal with Brussels.To win a vote, the prime minister would need the support of almost all Eurosceptics in the Conservative party, as well as most of the former Tories from whom he withdrew the whip and either the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) or a bloc of Labour MPs.Johnson is edging closer to the number he needs, with more prominent Eurosceptics now on board with his plans. Steve Baker, the leader of the European Research Group (ERG), sounded positive after a meeting in No 10: “The mood of the Eurosceptics meeting here tonight was that we do, we can and we must trust the PM.”However, the DUP, which has reservations over plans to leave Northern Ireland in close alignment with the EU, has still not publicly declared its backing and was reserving judgment on Tuesday night.Pro-deal Labour MPs would need reassurances about workers’ rights, environmental protections and the future relationship – and will come under pressure from their party not to vote with the government.Despite the fact that Theresa May’s deal was rejected three times by the Commons, Rees-Mogg said: “If a deal is agreed with the European Union, it will get through, in my view, the House of Commons because everybody’s desperate to finish this.”Shedding more light on the process, he said: “We’ve been doing this for three and a half years; it can’t go on forever. We are near a conclusion and parliament, once it’s agreed something, can legislate very quickly. So, if the meaningful vote goes through, then the legislation will merely be the ratification in domestic law of the treaty and that, I think, is a relatively easy bill to pass, if there is a deal.”He claimed some “big changes” have happened since May failed to get her deal with the EU through parliament, including a shift in the mood towards getting Brexit done and Brussels agreeing to reopen the withdrawal agreement.However, the former cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who resigned over Johnson’s lack of progress towards a deal, said she thought there was a “whiff of sexism” about Eurosceptics in the European Research Group being prepared to vote for the prime minister’s potential deal after rejecting May’s agreement.She told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Emma Barnet: “It is difficult to fillet it out, how much is about a more trusting relationship that they clearly have with Boris Johnson, because he himself was very much part of that ERG group in terms of wanting a harder Brexit than the former prime minister wanted, but I do feel as a woman who’s active in politics myself, that there is a whiff of sexism, as you put it, as well.”When asked why Conservative MPs could vote for a potential Johnson deal when they rejected May’s deal, Rudd said: “There are certain behaviours that particularly men in politics want to see, that women don’t so much, that Boris did adopt, which has given the ERG members a lot of confidence.“So, for instance, I was very opposed to the prime minister expelling 21 colleagues from the party as MPs, and I felt very strongly that Ken Clarke, who had been in Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet, should have a place in Boris Johnson’s party.“But he took a different view, and I thought that was a very aggressive thing to do, and unnecessary, and has had the effect of radicalising the 21 – which I have now joined. So that sort of aggressive behaviour, though, may be the sort of thing that a group of ERG men, particularly, wanted to see.”","'The votes are now there' for Brexit deal, says Jacob Rees-Mogg",2019-10-15/20:08:44,jacob rees mogg the leader of the house of commons has claimed the votes are now there for boris johnson to pass a brexit deal through parliament rees mogg a close ally of johnson who is responsible for legislation in the commons made the bold claim on the radio station lbc despite the fact the prime minister is yet to secure a deal with brussels to win a vote the prime minister would need the support of almost all eurosceptics in the conservative party as well as most of the former tories from whom he withdrew the whip and either the democratic unionist party dup or a bloc of labour mps johnson is edging closer to the number he needs with more prominent eurosceptics now on board with his plans steve baker the leader of the european research group erg sounded positive after a meeting in no  the mood of the eurosceptics meeting here tonight was that we do we can and we must trust the pm however the dup which has reservations over plans to leave northern ireland in close alignment with the eu has still not publicly declared its backing and was reserving judgment on tuesday night pro deal labour mps would need reassurances about workers rights environmental protections and the future relationship and will come under pressure from their party not to vote with the government despite the fact that theresa may s deal was rejected three times by the commons rees mogg said if a deal is agreed with the european union it will get through in my view the house of commons because everybody s desperate to finish this shedding more light on the process he said we ve been doing this for three and a half years it can t go on forever we are near a conclusion and parliament once it s agreed something can legislate very quickly so if the meaningful vote goes through then the legislation will merely be the ratification in domestic law of the treaty and that i think is a relatively easy bill to pass if there is a deal he claimed some big changes have happened since may failed to get her deal with the eu through parliament including a shift in the mood towards getting brexit done and brussels agreeing to reopen the withdrawal agreement however the former cabinet minister amber rudd who resigned over johnson s lack of progress towards a deal said she thought there was a whiff of sexism about eurosceptics in the european research group being prepared to vote for the prime minister s potential deal after rejecting may s agreement she told bbc radio  live s emma barnet it is difficult to fillet it out how much is about a more trusting relationship that they clearly have with boris johnson because he himself was very much part of that erg group in terms of wanting a harder brexit than the former prime minister wanted but i do feel as a woman who s active in politics myself that there is a whiff of sexism as you put it as well when asked why conservative mps could vote for a potential johnson deal when they rejected may s deal rudd said there are certain behaviours that particularly men in politics want to see that women don t so much that boris did adopt which has given the erg members a lot of confidence so for instance i was very opposed to the prime minister expelling  colleagues from the party as mps and i felt very strongly that ken clarke who had been in margaret thatcher s cabinet should have a place in boris johnson s party but he took a different view and i thought that was a very aggressive thing to do and unnecessary and has had the effect of radicalising the  which i have now joined so that sort of aggressive behaviour though may be the sort of thing that a group of erg men particularly wanted to see ,Brexit,0.254867285
377,"Michel Barnier has given Boris Johnson “one last chance” to settle on a plan for the Irish border that will prevent a hard border, protect the all-Ireland economy and avoid the creation of a backdoor into the single market for smugglers and fraudsters. EU leaders will gather in Brussels on Thursday to sign off on such a plan, or start talking about a Brexit extension.Johnson conceded to the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, last week that a deal involving the redrawing of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic was not on the cards as it would lead to checks, controls and infrastructure on the island of Ireland.The latest plan from Downing Street, albeit one first revealed by the Guardian as being in the government’s top draw in March 2018, is for a customs border in the Irish Sea – but only for goods travelling from Great Britain via Northern Ireland and on to the rest of the EU, including the Republic of Ireland.Northern Ireland would be part of the UK’s customs territory, but there would be a channel system at the region’s two main ports and airport: a green channel for goods from Great Britain destined only for sale in Northern Ireland and avoiding the need for checks or constraint on their movement; and a red channel for goods destined for beyond the region that would undergo checks and controls.There would be “draconian penalties for noncompliance” and goods would be tracked. There would be extra spot checks in the market to provide assurance that goods sold in the Republic Ireland met all the necessary requirements. Customs paperwork would be done ahead of time to allow those selling products in Northern Ireland to reclaim any differential in tariffs between the UK and the EU.The European commission regards the dual customs plan as untested and a threat to the single market owing to the danger of fraud and smuggling. Barnier has raised the example of sugar entering Northern Ireland on a lower tariff but then being sold on as part of a fizzy drink in the Republic. He also argues that the technology could not possibly be in place by the end of the transition period at the end of 2020.Barnier has suggested that any solution involving checks in the Irish Sea should be more based on the Irish backstop first proposed by the EU in February 2018: Northern Ireland stays in the EU’s customs territory and single market in goods. But he does appear to be open to some tweaking this to win over the UK parliament.Northern Ireland could in legal theory be outside the EU’s customs territory as long as the full customs code was enforced at the border: there would be no exemptions, derogations or channels. But a British rebate system could ensure that those selling only into Northern Ireland were not financially hit by tariffs. A hard sell to the Democratic Unionist party. But, as Barnier likes to say, the clock is ticking.",'One last chance': why Irish border question remains sticking point,2019-10-14/18:54:42,michel barnier has given boris johnson one last chance to settle on a plan for the irish border that will prevent a hard border protect the all ireland economy and avoid the creation of a backdoor into the single market for smugglers and fraudsters eu leaders will gather in brussels on thursday to sign off on such a plan or start talking about a brexit extension johnson conceded to the taoiseach leo varadkar last week that a deal involving the redrawing of a customs border between northern ireland and the republic was not on the cards as it would lead to checks controls and infrastructure on the island of ireland the latest plan from downing street albeit one first revealed by the guardian as being in the government s top draw in march  is for a customs border in the irish sea but only for goods travelling from great britain via northern ireland and on to the rest of the eu including the republic of ireland northern ireland would be part of the uk s customs territory but there would be a channel system at the region s two main ports and airport a green channel for goods from great britain destined only for sale in northern ireland and avoiding the need for checks or constraint on their movement and a red channel for goods destined for beyond the region that would undergo checks and controls there would be draconian penalties for noncompliance and goods would be tracked there would be extra spot checks in the market to provide assurance that goods sold in the republic ireland met all the necessary requirements customs paperwork would be done ahead of time to allow those selling products in northern ireland to reclaim any differential in tariffs between the uk and the eu the european commission regards the dual customs plan as untested and a threat to the single market owing to the danger of fraud and smuggling barnier has raised the example of sugar entering northern ireland on a lower tariff but then being sold on as part of a fizzy drink in the republic he also argues that the technology could not possibly be in place by the end of the transition period at the end of  barnier has suggested that any solution involving checks in the irish sea should be more based on the irish backstop first proposed by the eu in february  northern ireland stays in the eu s customs territory and single market in goods but he does appear to be open to some tweaking this to win over the uk parliament northern ireland could in legal theory be outside the eu s customs territory as long as the full customs code was enforced at the border there would be no exemptions derogations or channels but a british rebate system could ensure that those selling only into northern ireland were not financially hit by tariffs a hard sell to the democratic unionist party but as barnier likes to say the clock is ticking ,Brexit,0.264790744
398,"Hopes of a Brexit breakthrough surged after Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson went for a walk in the Wirral and declared “a pathway to a possible deal”. Four days later it is increasingly obvious that the pathway is steep and strewn with rocks.After a weekend of Brexit talks, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, gave EU diplomats a bleak account of progress on Sunday night. At the heart of the problem is the same old Brexit conundrum: how can the UK quit the EU customs union and single market while maintaining an open border with Ireland to protect peace on the island.Last Thursday at Thornton Manor, Johnson made a major concession: he agreed there should be no customs border on the island of Ireland. That was the key to triggering the current round of intensified talks in Brussels. But dashing EU hopes, it is clear the UK is not seeking to return to a lightly retouched version of Barnier’s original plan, the Northern Ireland-only backstop. Instead, the UK hopes to devise an unprecedented bespoke customs deal for Northern Ireland.While the British have not disclosed the plan, EU sources have outlined the main details. Northern Ireland would be legally part of the UK customs area, but practically in the EU customs union, following European rules on tariffs and quotas. It would be simultaneously in and out – a model quickly called Schrödinger’s customs union, in mock homage to the physicist’s theoretical cat that was simultaneously dead and alive.Partly based on a cast-off Theresa May plan, it would allow Johnson to claim the whole of the UK has left the EU. Yet just as May discovered with her customs partnership, problems are plentiful. Brussels is worried about fraud and undermining EU customs rules. Business fears a bureaucratic nightmare. If a Northern Irish fizzy drinks company buys sugar from a non-EU country, what is the legal status of the sugar in the sugar-laden drinks destined for EU consumers? In talks on Monday and Tuesday, the EU are demanding answers to this sickly sweet problem.Barnier was unsparing about the risks for the EU, warning it could unravel the European customs code and poses a serious risk of fraud that could tarnish the single market. While the single market sounds abstract, at heart are concerns about consumer health and safety, and the reputation of European goods and produce. EU officials remember the BSE crisis as a vivid example of how a food scandal can destroy lives and farmers’ reputations.With the customs problem unresolved, the two sides have made little progress on the other stumbling block, how to ensure greater democratic buy-in for Northern Ireland. In another significant concession, Johnson has dropped his insistence that the DUP should be able to veto the creation of an all-Ireland regulatory zone for goods – a key part of the jigsaw in avoiding a hard border. But the two sides have not agreed an alternative consent mechanism, with EU diplomats adamant there can be no unilateral right of exit.Johnson is rapidly discovering the Brexit constraints that May eventually knew so well: EU red lines, strong opposition in the House of Commons – and time.The EU will not take a risky gamble on an untested customs partnership to get a deal over the line on 31 October. If the prime minister wants to stick to his “do or die” pledge, his best hope is a rebranded, retouched version of the EU’s original Northern Ireland only backstop – rejected by May, as something no British prime minister could ever accept.Returning to the original backstop risks failing in the House of Commons. But so does Johnson’s preferred “double customs” plan.

442,"Jeremy Corbyn has poured cold water on the idea that Labour could support an attempt to attach a referendum to Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal at next Saturday’s emergency sitting of parliament.The prime minister is expected to convene the House of Commons for a rare Saturday session, either to ask for support for his deal, if he succeeds in striking one at this week’s European council – or to request that MPs back a no-deal exit at the end of this month.Pro-remain MPs hope to amend any motion put by the government, to insist that Johnson’s deal be subject to a public vote.But asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News whether some MPs would be more likely to support a deal if it would be put to a referendum, Corbyn said, “I think many in parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others, might be inclined to support it, because they don’t really agree with the deal – but I would caution them on this.”He said he would instead be keen to see a Labour-style Brexit deal, including a customs union, and guarantees on workers’ rights and environmental standards, put to the public.Corbyn’s comments appeared to put him at odds with the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who said in a speech in Glasgow on Saturday that Labour would press for any deal Johnson secures to be subject to a referendum.“Next week our priorities are clear: if Boris Johnson does manage to negotiate a deal, then we will insist that it is put back to the people in a confirmatory vote,” Starmer said.The Labour leadership has been torn for many months between what it sees as the need to reach out to leave voters in Labour constituencies and the party’s membership, which is strongly remain.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has been accused by some on the left of the party in recent days of making too many concessions to the People’s Vote campaign.The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is a close ally of McDonnell’s and widely regarded as a potential future leadership contender, struck a different tone to Corbyn on Sunday.She said Labour’s policy was that any deal should be put to the public, whether negotiated by a future Labour government, or by Johnson. “I think it should be the position if we’re faced with a deal that’s passed through the Commons by an unelected Tory prime minister that could potentially be damaging to our economy,” said Long-Bailey.On Sky, Corbyn also declined to offer support to those Labour MPs who wanted a referendum held before any general election.Asked which should come first, he carefully laid out Labour’s position, as agreed at the party’s conference in Brighton last month.“We have to get a deal that we can agree on if possible, and the Labour position is that we would take this to a public vote, with a Labour government. Within three months we would hope to reach agreement with the EU. We believe that to be possible, along the lines we’ve set out – and within six months, hold a referendum,” Corbyn said.“And a Labour government would then implement the results of that referendum: between a sensible relationship with Europe, and remain.”Asked when an election should be, Corbyn said: “We’ll look at any deal that comes up, before we trigger an election.” He said he was keen to focus on other issues, including investment, tackling the climate crisis and education.He also brushed aside the question of whether he would step down if Labour lost another general election, as  McDonnell suggested he would in an interview with GQ magazine on Friday.“We’re not expecting to lose the next election: it’s a hypothetical question, and it’s up to the members of our party to decide who the leader is,” Corbyn said. Asked to identify potential candidates, he said: “I am not into the business of ordaining people.”Asked what Labour will do if Johnson failed to pass a deal and refused to implement the Benn act by not requesting a delay to Brexit, Corbyn said his party would “take parliamentary action against him at that point” either through legislation or a no-confidence vote.Corbyn also underlined the Labour stance that he should lead any temporary government were Johnson to lose a confidence vote.“Of course: I’m the leader of the opposition,” said Corbyn. “All the British parliamentary precedents, going back as far as you care to look, are that the first option is that the leader of the opposition be invited to form an administration.”As the Scottish National party gather for its annual conference in Aberdeen, Corbyn denied Labour would consider a formal coalition with the SNP after a general election. “We’re not going into coalition with anybody,” he said.Asked about the possibility of Labour supporting a fresh Scottish independence vote, he said: “We would certainly not countenance it in the early days, or early years, of a Labour government, because I think the 2014 referendum was supposed to be a once in a lifetime opportunity.”",Corbyn cautions against public vote on Johnson's Brexit deal,2019-10-13/10:18:09,jeremy corbyn has poured cold water on the idea that labour could

550,"When Boris Johnson was foreign secretary he allegedly asked his staff about Leo Varadkar: “Why isn’t he called Murphy like all the rest of them?”It was presumably a joke – and not greatly appreciated when the leaked remark reached Dublin. But Johnson had hit on a basic truth about Varadkar. He is not a typical Irish politician.The gay son of an Indian immigrant, a trained medical doctor, and socially awkward, the taoiseach does not fit the usual mould.Instead of gladhanding constituents and attending funerals, two traditional elements of Ireland’s parish pump politics, Varadkar prefers to read policy papers and strategise with aides. He is, in other words, that person mocked by Johnson: a swot.Yet when the two met in north-west England on Thursday, in private, away from journalists and the usual panoply of summitry, Johnson was forced to look up to Varadkar, both literally and metaphorically.The taoiseach is 1.93m ( 6ft 4in) and stands on the shoulders of the European Union – its commission, council, parliament and all 27 member states.The Irish government’s success in mobilising the EU behind the border backstop has rebalanced Ireland’s historically subservient relationship with Britain.Yet Varadkar, like Johnson, is under immense pressure. If the UK leaves the EU with no deal it will hammer Ireland’s economy and destabilise Northern Ireland. But accepting a tweaked version of Downing Street’s current plan, or some other plan that weakens the backstop, could torpedo Varadkar’s hopes of winning Ireland’s looming election.The taoiseach would have got straight down to business.“He doesn’t have a lot of time for, or interest in, small talk,” said Brendan O’Shea, a doctor who trained Varadkar as a medical student. “We have someone who is forensic about what he thinks should be done. The calculating machine will make a decision about what is the best decision then the politician will switch on and figure out a way to sell that.”Growing up as a GP’s son in a middle-class Dublin suburb, young Leo declared, at the age of eight, an ambition to become health minister.A biography says that, as a teenager on a school trip to Northern Ireland, the future taoiseach smuggled fireworks back into the republic, which some might consider a metaphor for his role in Brexit.Varadkar studied medicine at Trinity College Dublin and joined Fine Gael, a centre-right party. Outspoken about tax cuts and welfare reform, some called him “Tory boy”. His heroes included Otto von Bismarck and Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary.As a Teachta Dála (member of the Irish parliament) and minister, Varadkar earned a reputation for energy, direct language and social stiffness – some public interactions left aides cringing.Johnson’s bonhomie, however, may not be totally wasted on Varadkar, who has loosened up since coming out as gay in 2015.“It’s not something that defines me,” the then health minister told RTÉ. “I’m not a half-Indian politician, or a doctor politician or a gay politician for that matter. It’s just part of who I am.”It was a brave admission – Ireland had yet to legalise same-sex marriage. The response was overwhelmingly positive and Varadkar went on to succeed Enda Kenny as leader of Fine Gael and taoiseach in 2017, and in the process to go from Mars bar binger to fitness fanatic.“Coming out changes everybody,” said Tiernan Brady, an LGBT activist who advised Varadkar. “In accepting who you are to yourself, and that you can still go on to lead your party and your country, that’s been really affirming. That brings you a whole level of confidence.”Some Irish backstop sceptics warn that Varadkar’s government may be suffering from over-confidence, that bending Brussels to Dublin’s agenda may backfire, and that the broad national consensus behind the strategy may deter the taoiseach from compromising.“Varadkar’s personal political interests have diverted from the national interest,” said Dan O’Brien, the chief economist at the Institute of International and European Affairs. “His political career could be ended by making a concession on the backstop. Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin would come down on him like a tonne of bricks. It’s never a good idea for a leader to be painted into a corner.”",Breaking the mould: Leo Varadkar is no typical Irish politician,2019-10-10/18:55:16,when boris johnson was foreign secretary he allegedly asked his staff about leo varadkar why isn t he called murphy like all the rest of them it was presumably a joke and not greatly appreciated when the leaked remark reached dublin but johnson had hit on a basic truth about varadkar he is not a typical irish politician the gay son of an indian immigrant a trained medical doctor and socially awkward the taoiseach does not fit the usual mould instead of gladhanding constituents and attending funerals two traditional elements of ireland s parish pump politics varadkar prefers to read policy papers and strategise with aides he is in other words that person mocked by johnson a swot yet when the two met in north west england on thursday in private away from journalists and the usual panoply of summitry johnson was forced to look up to varadkar both literally and metaphorically the taoiseach is  m ft in and stands on the shoulders of the european union its commission council parliament and all  member states the irish government s success in mobilising the eu behind the border backstop has rebalanced ireland s historically subservient relationship with britain yet varadkar like johnson is under immense pressure if the uk leaves the eu with no deal it will hammer ireland s economy and destabilise northern ireland but accepting a tweaked version of downing street s current plan or some other plan that weakens the backstop could torpedo varadkar s hopes of winning ireland s looming election the taoiseach would have got straight down to business he doesn t have a lot of time for or interest in small talk said brendan o shea a doctor who trained varadkar as a medical student we have someone who is forensic about what he thinks should be done the calculating machine will make a decision about what is the best decision then the politician will switch on and figure out a way to sell that growing up as a gp s son in a middle class dublin suburb young leo declared at the age of eight an ambition to become health minister a biography says that as a teenager on a school trip to northern ireland the future taoiseach smuggled fireworks back into the republic which some might consider a metaphor for his role in brexit varadkar studied medicine at trinity college dublin and joined fine gael a centre right party outspoken about tax cuts and welfare reform some called him tory boy his heroes included otto von bismarck and ryanair s michael o leary as a teachta dála member of the irish parliament and minister varadkar earned a reputation for energy direct language and social stiffness some public interactions left aides cringing johnson s bonhomie however may not be totally wasted on varadkar who has loosened up since coming out as gay in  it s not something that defines me the then health minister told rté i m not a half indian politician or a doctor politician or a gay politician for that matter it s just part of who i am it was a brave admission ireland had yet to legalise same sex marriage the response was overwhelmingly positive and varadkar went on to succeed enda kenny as leader of fine gael and taoiseach in  and in the process to go from mars bar binger to fitness fanatic coming out changes everybody said tiernan brady an lgbt activist who advised varadkar in accepting who you are to yourself and that you can still go on to lead your party and your country that s been really affirming that brings you a whole level of confidence some irish backstop sceptics warn that varadkar s government may be suffering from over confidence that bending brussels to dublin s agenda may backfire and that the broad national consensus behind the strategy may deter the taoiseach from compromising varadkar s personal political interests have diverted from the national interest said dan o brien the chief economist at the institute of international and european affairs his political career could be ended by making a concession on the backstop fianna fáil and sinn féin would come down on him like a tonne of bricks it s never a good idea for a leader to be painted into a corner ,Brexit,0.224412516
607,"In light of everything that was known about Boris Johnson before becoming prime minister, his inability to resolve Brexit once installed in Downing Street was to be expected. Only the manner of his failure was unpredictable. Mr Johnson was lazy in his assessment of the EU negotiating position, arrogant in his handling of parliament, and complacent about the strength of opposition there. But perhaps the prime minister’s most damaging error has been to confuse campaign rhetoric with the reality of government.Mr Johnson believed the arguments he used to persuade Tory members to elect him as their leader. He said that Theresa May’s deal was obsolete and that a better deal would be available if the UK listened less to Brussels. That proposition has now been tested and found to be false. Mr Johnson’s alternative Brexit proposals have been rejected. It is not clear whether Downing Street intended its plan to be the starting point for a serious negotiation or just a provocation – designed for rejection ahead of a campaign vilifying foreigners as the obstacles to Brexit liberation.The more cynical view is supported by an anonymous briefing, sourced to No 10, narrating a telephone call in which Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, appeared to demand that Mr Johnson surrender Northern Ireland to Brussels. No one who is familiar with Mrs Merkel’s style of diplomacy imagines that Downing Street accurately reflected what was said. The purpose of such a briefing was to make compromise less likely and stoke international enmity for tactical domestic advantage. It is unclear whether Mr Johnson authorised that message but it hardly matters. He is responsible for his messengers and they are sabotaging the UK’s relationship with vital European allies.A root of the problem is the recruitment to Downing Street of leading figures from the Vote Leave referendum campaign, including its executive strategist Dominic Cummings. That clique is not respectful of Conservative traditions and, in the case of Mr Cummings, despises any sentimental attachment to established modes of governance. That ethos is incompatible with the side of Downing Street that wants to be an orthodox Tory administration, engaging with parliament, maintaining relations with neighbouring states and preserving a semblance of sober statecraft. Those ambitions lead some of the prime minister’s staff and cabinet colleagues to seek a Brexit deal.As a leadership candidate, Mr Johnson did not foresee a clash between the Vote Leave model of relentless campaigning aggression and the day-to-day conduct of grown-up government. He now faces a choice, crystallised in the question of whether to submit to the Benn Act, which requires that the government seek an article 50 extension in the absence of a deal. A responsible prime minister would obey the law (or resign if he felt unable to do so). But Downing Street has let it be known that other notions are under consideration. There are hints at unidentified ruses, suggesting the law might not be so legally binding.Even if the courts compelled compliance, forcing their hand would allow Mr Johnson to portray himself as a Brexit martyr. He might then be in a stronger position to run as the tribune of the people, defying a Europhile establishment in parliament and the judiciary. That is the stuff of authoritarian subversion, and should not appear in the repertoire of democratic politicians.Mr Johnson is not yet at that point, but it is within sight. The prospects of agreement with the EU look remote. The decision to hold an emergency Saturday session of parliament on 19 October, an expedient usually limited to wartime, looks designed to aggravate, not calm, the sense of national emergency. But the prime minister’s choice reveals a more profound conflict at the heart of Downing Street. He has chosen a strategy for fighting an election that requires behaviour unsuitable for running a government. He can be a wrecking candidate, attacking diplomatic, constitutional and democratic norms, or he can be a serious head of government. He can submit to the rule of law or he can pose as a lord of misrule. He cannot do both.",The Guardian view on Johnson’s choice: rule of law or misrule,2019-10-09/18:30:01,in light of everything that was known about boris johnson before becoming prime minister his inability to resolve brexit once installed in downing street was to be expected only the manner of his failure was unpredictable mr johnson was lazy in his assessment of the eu negotiating position arrogant in his handling of parliament and complacent about the strength of opposition there but perhaps the prime minister s most damaging error has been to confuse campaign rhetoric with the reality of government mr johnson believed the arguments he used to persuade tory members to elect him as their leader he said that theresa may s deal was obsolete and that a better deal would be available if the uk listened less to brussels that proposition has now been tested and found to be false mr johnson s alternative brexit proposals have been rejected it is not clear whether downing street intended its plan to be the starting point for a serious negotiation or just a provocation designed for rejection ahead of a campaign vilifying foreigners as the obstacles to brexit liberation the more cynical view is supported by an anonymous briefing sourced to no  narrating a telephone call in which angela merkel the german chancellor appeared to demand that mr johnson surrender northern ireland to brussels no one who is familiar with mrs merkel s style of diplomacy imagines that downing street accurately reflected what was said the purpose of such a briefing was to make compromise less likely and stoke international enmity for tactical domestic advantage it is unclear whether mr johnson authorised that message but it hardly matters he is responsible for his messengers and they are sabotaging the uk s relationship with vital european allies a root of the problem is the recruitment to downing street of leading figures from the vote leave referendum campaign including its executive strategist dominic cummings that clique is not respectful of conservative traditions and in the case of mr cummings despises any sentimental attachment to established modes of governance that ethos is incompatible with the side of downing street that wants to be an orthodox tory administration engaging with parliament maintaining relations with neighbouring states and preserving a semblance of sober statecraft those ambitions lead some of the prime minister s staff and cabinet colleagues to seek a brexit deal as a leadership candidate mr johnson did not foresee a clash between the vote leave model of relentless campaigning aggression and the day to day conduct of grown up government he now faces a choice crystallised in the question of whether to submit to the benn act which requires that the government seek an article  extension in the absence of a deal a responsible prime minister would obey the law or resign if he felt unable to do so but downing street has let it be known that other notions are under consideration there are hints at unidentified ruses suggesting the law might not be so legally binding even if the courts compelled compliance forcing their hand would allow mr johnson to portray himself as a brexit martyr he might then be in a stronger position to run as the tribune of the people defying a europhile establishment in parliament and the judiciary that is the stuff of authoritarian subversion and should not appear in the repertoire of democratic politicians mr johnson is not yet at that point but it is within sight the prospects of agreement with the eu look remote the decision to hold an emergency saturday session of parliament on  october an expedient usually limited to wartime looks designed to aggravate not calm the sense of national emergency but the prime minister s choice reveals a more profound conflict at the heart of downing street he has chosen a strategy for fighting an election that requires behaviour unsuitable for running a government he can be a wrecking candidate attacking diplomatic constitutional and democratic norms or he can be a serious head of government he can submit to the rule of law or he can pose as a lord of misrule he cannot do both ,Brexit,0.198064908
648,"The Irish government has hit back at “misinformation” and “pressure” from Britain as talks over a Brexit deal tottered towards collapse.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, said on Tuesday that his administration was working “flat out” for a deal, despite accusations from Downing Street that Dublin had virtually sabotaged any chance of compromise.“No country wants a deal more than Ireland but we will not strike a deal at any cost,” he told a press conference in the Irish capital.Boris Johnson spoke to his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, on Tuesday evening. Downing Street said that “both sides strongly reiterated their desire to reach a Brexit deal” and hoped to meet in person later in the week.However when Coveney was asked earlier about the Downing Street briefings that accused Varadkar of derailing talks with inflexibility over the backstop, he said there had been a “lot of misinformation” and an attempt to pressure Ireland.Without naming Johnson, Dominic Cummings or any other figure in the British government, Coveney said there were “conflicting reports” from London and “a hard line” from those briefing the media.Coveney said that Ireland had welcomed Johnson’s Brexit proposals last week as a “step forward” while stressing that more work was needed to find a solution.“There is an ongoing conversation in Brussels and we want to contribute to that in a constructive way ... the taoiseach wants to find a compromise that works. But he is not willing to be boxed into a corner.”Dublin had been “upfront and honest” in highlighting problems with Downing Street’s plan, said Coveney. “We can’t pretend we’re solving problems when we’re not.”The foreign minister, who doubles as deputy prime minister, said a blame game seemed to be eclipsing a search for solutions: “But this is too enormous an issue to be focusing on the politics of blame.”Coveney was due later to travel to Brussels to meet Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator.EU and Irish officials have criticised Downing Street’s plan as unworkable for taking Northern Ireland out of the EU’s customs union and for giving the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) a veto over trading arrangements.On Tuesday, a No 10 source accused the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, of making a deal impossible. Brussels responded by accusing Johnson of trying to play a “stupid blame game”.Despite Coveney’s insistence that a last-minute deal was still possible, there was a growing sense of dread in Dublin that no-deal Brexit was edging closer, heralding political instability in Northern Ireland and economic pain on both sides of the Irish border.Ireland’s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, warned of turbulence while presenting the annual budget to the Dáil on Tuesday. “This is a budget that has been developed in the shadow of Brexit,” he said.The country has enjoyed strong growth and tax receipts, but Donohoe said the increasing likelihood of the UK exiting the EU without a deal posed a “pressing and immediate risk” to Ireland’s economy.The government deferred tax cuts and allocated €1.2bn, excluding EU funding, to cushion any shock. Donohoe earmarked €650m to support the agriculture, enterprise and tourism sectors, as well as regions that would be most affected by a no-deal Brexit.At sombre press conferences following the budget announcement, successive ministers detailed their departments’ no-deal Brexit contingency plans. One minister referred to the preparations as “triage”.The teetering Brexit talks have caused the gulf between political parties in Northern Ireland to widen.Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, claimed that an Irish plot had been exposed. “The prime minister’s proposals have flushed out Dublin’s real intentions to trap Northern Ireland in the EU customs union forever, where Dublin rather than the United Kingdom’s elected representatives would be in the driving seat.”Sinn Féin’s deputy leader, Michelle O’Neill, accused the DUP and “other delusional Brexit cheerleaders” of exposing Northern Ireland to potentially catastrophic consequences.“The north’s economy cannot withstand being excluded from the customs union and the single market, and that is the message we will be bringing loud and clear to

750,"One of the disconcerting things about Brexit is its capacity constantly to rewrite the script of political dysfunction. The latest government proposals won’t work. They do represent a significant concession, but create an incoherent muddle leading to a bizarre outcome.Northern Ireland would remain part of Europe’s single market but Britain would leave it. There would be regulatory checks down the Irish Sea but not at the Irish border. There would however be customs checks, so the border would not be open as now. And Northern Ireland’s membership of the single market could be unilaterally revoked by its assembly, which is not presently able to constitute itself, and so the whole plan is subject to the notorious vagaries of Northern Irish politics.Europe will demand a dropping of the DUP veto and something near to the backstop on the customs union. But even if the Johnson government finally concedes everything, the result would be a horrible deal for the UK. And, as presently formed, the proposal undermines the Good Friday agreement in fundamental respects.The open border between north and south was key. Had that been in doubt, there would never have been a peace agreementIt is almost 100 years since the Republic of Ireland insisted on its independence, after the failure of various home rule initiatives to save the union. The six largely unionist and Protestant counties of the north remained with the UK. The south became the Irish nation. It was always an uneasy peace, because a big part of the northern population was Catholic and nationalist, whereas the southern Protestants, like my mother’s family in Donegal, were relatively few in number.Crucial to maintenance of the peace was the idea of an open border between north and south in recognition of the fact that around the border families intermingled, did business and trade and moved, often several times a day, across it. They were separate countries but treated for the practical purposes of daily life as if they were the same.After the second world war, the Republic of Ireland and the UK were in lockstep. We were both out of the EU until, on the same day in 1973, we both joined.At the time, Britain was more enthusiastic about Europe than Ireland. But Ireland understood that because of the strength of the ties between north and south, and the necessity of keeping the border open, if the UK joined, Ireland had to follow suit.However, nationalist and republican sentiment had been rising in Northern Ireland, culminating in the outbreak of violence at the end of the 1960s and in the bitter conflict that over the ensuing three decades cost thousands of lives and untold suffering.When the Good Friday agreement was negotiated in April 1998, the most painstaking and difficult negotiation I was ever involved in, Europe played a role in two ways.Ireland and the UK had started to put the old enmities behind us, as we co-operated in Europe, often finding common cause on issues, and European trade had become a vital part of the island of Ireland’s economy.The shared future in Europe meant that the border diminished in significance. In addition, at the core of the agreement was the following deal: Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK for as long as a majority in the north wanted it, but in return the nationalist aspirations and identity of those who wanted a united Ireland would be recognised and given effect.The open border between north and south was key. Had that been in doubt, there would never have been a peace agreement. Simple as that.All this is to show that the issue of the Irish border is not some invented ruse by “Remoaners” to derail “the will of the people” – it has deep historical roots and was always bound to be critical to the Brexit debate.Now, for the first time, the border between north and south will be the external border of the EU. And if, as Brexiters demand, the UK leaves not just the political structures of Europe but its trading structures – the single market and customs union – then it follows that there will be border checks and the principle of an open border breached. However, right at the outset, when Boris Johnson was foreign secretary, the May government insisted the open border would remain untouched. There was therefore a self-evident inconsistency between that commitment and the commitment to leave the single market and customs union. It could have been resolved by treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. But the government also gave a commitment to the DUP that Northern Ireland would be treated the same.Hence May’s Chequers proposals, which provoked Johnson’s resignation. Her solution was to align the inconsistent commitments essentially by agreeing that the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the single market and with the backstop to fix the customs union problem.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland. Interactive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderJohnson’s solution is effectively to breach the commitment to the unionists, but compensate with a unionist veto, treat Northern Ireland and the UK differently for the single market, but the same for the customs union. He has exactly the dilemma of Theresa May. Either Northern Ireland is treated differently for trade in its entirety or the whole of the UK remains in Europe’s trading system.The present hotchpotch achieves neither outcome, and would undermine the peace so carefully constructed and kept despite all the challenges for more than two decades, with any border-related infrastructure a potential target for violent elements and with a weakening of the “one island” culture at the heart of nationalist aspirations.And this is a bad deal for Britain. The hard Brexit future relationship Johnson promises for Britain will be a hideously painful negotiation that will mean years more of Brexit distraction and made tougher every time a minister proclaims how we intend to compete with Europe on tax and regulation. Even more so with no deal.The biggest tragicomic aspect of the whole sorry saga is the erroneous belief that “getting Brexit done” in this way allows us to “move on”.There is only one way to bring Brexit resolution: to ask the people, given three years of accumulated experience and knowledge and with a specific government position before them, whether they want to tell us again or think again. I live in hope that, having tried everything else, our political leadership will finally realise this.",The EU was crucial to securing peace in Ireland.

823,"Boris Johnson has reached for the word compromise many times in the last two days as he has promoted his new Brexit proposals. There were three mentions of compromise in his party conference speech in Manchester on Wednesday, a further four in his letter to the European commission, two in the statement he delivered to MPs at Westminster on Thursday and several others in the exchanges that followed.These usages, although tendentious, are not wholly specious. Mr Johnson’s proposals are an attempt to bridge the gap between the EU-UK withdrawal agreement signed by Theresa May last year and the root-and-branch rejection of that agreement by the Conservative party’s most dogmatic pro-Brexit faction. Setting aside the fact that Mr Johnson himself voted for that agreement in March, the prime minister has moved the dial a few notches from his previous determination to get rid of the Northern Ireland backstop in its entirety.However, the new proposals are not a compromise with the European Union, which is the body with which he ought to be seeking a deal. They are a compromise with the Democratic Unionist party. Mr Johnson has courted the DUP more assiduously than even Mrs May did. He has spoken at their conferences, invited them into Downing Street and generally gone the extra mile to find ways of appeasing their demands that Northern Ireland should not be treated differently from the rest of the UK. The compromise Mr Johnson has now made with the DUP allows him to say that there can be some all-Ireland regulations for a limited period – which would mean Britain and Northern Ireland leaving on different terms – while the DUP has secured an effective veto over their further continuation, thus ensuring that Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory in the longer term. But they are talking to themselves, not to the wider polities of Ireland, Britain or Europe.Mr Johnson ignores three huge issues. The first is that the DUP does not speak for Northern Ireland, whose people voted to remain in the EU in 2016 and where opinion polls regularly show support for the backstop and for separate treatment for Northern Ireland to preserve the all-Ireland economy. By allowing the DUP to act as if it is the government of Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson ignores the majority that oppose the DUP’s pro-Brexit stance and mounting evidence that the DUP is now losing the hegemony that it used to enjoy. Giving a decisive role to Northern Ireland institutions that are suspended for intractable reasons solves nothing (and triggers the demand from Scotland that their devolved institutions should get a veto too). It suggests Mr Johnson might not be able to make his deal stick, even if the EU agreed to it.The second problem is that Mr Johnson’s plans renege on the principles, and legally rooted treaty guarantees, of north-south cooperation that have been the bedrock of the increasingly precarious Northern Ireland peace process. Preserving the Belfast/Good Friday agreement was at the core of Mrs May’s approach. It is part of the EU (Withdrawal) Act itself that the UK will not create any form of “physical infrastructure” for border arrangements after Brexit. The reason why there is a backstop at all is because the May government took these promises seriously. Like so many English Tories in the past and today, Mr Johnson simply does not share that sense of responsibility. His plans betray Britain’s solemn promise and ignore the consequences for Ireland.The final problem is that the vagueness of Mr Johnson’s plans leaves a hole in the EU single market without proposing a workable solution. Controls of any kind are inconsistent with the principle of frictionless trade, while loose controls threaten rules and protections for consumers. It is typical of Mr Johnson and the hardliners that they have failed to engage with these realities at all.Yet the realities are immutable. Britain has profound legal and political obligations to the people of Ireland. Britain has deep moral obligations too. None of these are upheld in the government’s new proposals or by the untrustworthy way Britain behaves on the Irish and European stage. Mr Johnson calls it compromise. It should be called perfidy.",The Guardian view on the backstop proposals: Britain’s broken promise,2019-10-03/18:15:49,boris johnson has reached for the word compromise many times in the last two days as he has promoted his new brexit proposals there were three mentions of compromise in his party conference speech in manchester on wednesday a further four in his letter to the european commission two in the statement he delivered to mps at westminster on thursday and several others in the exchanges that followed these usages although tendentious are not wholly specious mr johnson s proposals are an attempt to bridge the gap between the eu uk withdrawal agreement signed by theresa may last year and the root and branch rejection of that agreement by the conservative party s most dogmatic pro brexit faction setting aside the fact that mr johnson himself voted for that agreement in march the prime minister has moved the dial a few notches from his previous determination to get rid of the northern ireland backstop in its entirety however the new proposals are not a compromise with the european union which is the body with which he ought to be seeking a deal they are a compromise with the democratic unionist party mr johnson has courted the dup more assiduously than even mrs may did he has spoken at their conferences invited them into downing street and generally gone the extra mile to find ways of appeasing their demands that northern ireland should not be treated differently from the rest of the uk the compromise mr johnson has now made with the dup allows him to say that there can be some all ireland regulations for a limited period which would mean britain and northern ireland leaving on different terms while the dup has secured an effective veto over their further continuation thus ensuring that northern ireland will be fully part of the uk customs territory in the longer term but they are talking to themselves not to the wider polities of ireland britain or europe mr johnson ignores three huge issues the first is that the dup does not speak for northern ireland whose people voted to remain in the eu in  and where opinion polls regularly show support for the backstop and for separate treatment for northern ireland to preserve the all ireland economy by allowing the dup to act as if it is the government of northern ireland mr johnson ignores the majority that oppose the dup s pro brexit stance and mounting evidence that the dup is now losing the hegemony that it used to enjoy giving a decisive role to northern ireland institutions that are suspended for intractable reasons solves nothing and triggers the demand from scotland that their devolved institutions should get a veto too it suggests mr johnson might not be able to make his deal stick even if the eu agreed to it the second problem is that mr johnson s plans renege on the principles and legally rooted treaty guarantees of north south cooperation that have been the bedrock of the increasingly precarious northern ireland peace process preserving the belfast good friday agreement was at the core of mrs may s approach it is part of the eu withdrawal act itself that the uk will not create any form of physical infrastructure for border arrangements after brexit the reason why there is a backstop at all is because the may government took these promises seriously like so many english tories in the past and today mr johnson simply does not share that sense of responsibility his plans betray britain s solemn promise and ignore the consequences for ireland the final problem is that the vagueness of mr johnson s plans leaves a hole in the eu single market without proposing a workable solution controls of any kind are inconsistent with the principle of frictionless trade while loose controls threaten rules and protections for consumers it is typical of mr johnson and the hardliners that they have failed to engage with these realities at all yet the realities are immutable britain has profound legal and political obligations to the people of ireland britain has deep moral obligations too none of these are upheld in the government s new proposals or by the untrustworthy way britain behaves on the irish and european stage mr johnson calls it compromise it should be called perfidy ,Brexit,0.300250262
835,"The European parliament has told Boris Johnson that his proposals for the Irish border do not “even remotely” amount to an acceptable deal for the EU, in comments echoed by Ireland’s prime minister.The committee of MEPs representing the parliament’s views on Brexit said the prime minister’s proposals could not form the basis for an agreement, describing them as a “last-minute” effort. The European parliament will have a veto on any withdrawal agreement.“Safeguarding peace and stability on the island of Ireland, protection of citizens and EU’s legal order has to be the main focus of any deal,” it said in a statement. “The UK proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise in the backstop.”Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also accused Johnson of contradicting his own proposals during an appearance by the British prime minister in the Commons, in which he sought to convince MPs there would be no return of a hard Irish border.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border.

Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland. Interactive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderSpeaking shortly after Johnson addressed the Commons, Varadkar highlighted a discrepancy between Johnson’s words and the legal text tabled by the UK government.“I am reassured by what Prime Minister Johnson said today: that he is not proposing that there should be any new physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland linked to customs or customs checks,” Varadkar said.“But that is actually in contradiction to the papers presented by the UK government yesterday. So I think working with the EU taskforce in part, [Michel] Barnier’s taskforce, and also talking with the UK government we will have to tease out the detail of what those proposals mean.”In a barbed comment, Varadkar further suggested the British public had changed its mind on Brexit but was being prevented from having its voice heard. “All the polls since Mr Johnson became PM suggest that’s what the British people actually want, but their political system is not able to give them that choice,” he said. Guy Verhofstadt, the former prime minister of Belgium who coordinates the European parliament’s Brexit steering group, said it was “nearly impossible” to see how a deal could be secured on the basis of the proposals.He pointed to a leaked script handed to Conservative MPs by the party, which instructed them to attack the EU as “crazy” if it rejected proposals as an indication of Johnson’s insincerity about wanting a deal.“If there is a Tory document saying that they have to blame the European Union then it’s obvious that that is the purpose,” he said.The prime minister had said in his letter to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, accompanying the legal text of the UK’s proposals for replacing the Irish backstop that his ideas amounted to a “broad landing zone” for a deal.He will now be tested by the EU on how far he will compromise on the key areas of contention, in particular on the imposition of a customs border on the island of Ireland, a seeming red line for the new government.The parliament’s Brexit steering group said the plan for customs checks and controls on the island of Ireland would “breach a range of fundamental principles and red lines”.“The UK proposals on customs and on regulatory aspects explicitly provide for infrastructure, controls and checks but are unclear as to exactly where and how these would be carried out,” the committee said. “Any form of controls and checks in and around the border would signify the end of frictionless trade and as such would harm the all-island economy as well as represent a serious risk to the peace process, and could imply a serious risk for our consumers and businesses.”The MEPs said the parliament would also veto any withdrawal agreement that did not provide a failsafe solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.The UK’s suggestion of working out the details of how technology could be used to help with that during the Brexit transition period was said to be unacceptable.Johnson has proposed that Northern Ireland stay in the EU’s single market for goods on the basis that Stormont agrees in a vote before the end of the transition period, and then every four years.The committee said this provided a unilateral right to exit arrangements that would create huge uncertainty for the Republic of Ireland.The MEPs said: “The right of consent being offered to the Northern Irish assembly effectively makes an agreement contingent, uncertain, provisional, unilateral, instead of the safety net provided for by the backstop.“Furthermore, the Northern Irish assembly has not sat for nearly three years, and it is questionable whether it would be able to reconvene and take on the responsibility for an international treaty of this nature.”The UK’s negotiator, David Frost, is expected back in Brussels on Friday, possibly with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. EU sources said that it was crucial for him to indicate that the government was willing to give further ground to get a deal before 31 October when the UK is due to leave the bloc.A European commission spokeswoman said it was up the British government to move its position for progress to be possible, and that Juncker had made that point in a phone call with Johnson.She said: “There are problematic points in the UK’s proposal and further work is needed. This work is for the UK to do, not the other way around.”Speaking after a meeting with Sweden’s prime minister, Varadkar said Ireland’s objective remained to avoid “any customs posts between north and south or any tariffs or restraints on trade between north and south”.“They were all abolished in the 1990s,” Varadkar said. “We don’t want to go back to that. The majority of the people in the north don’t, the majority of the people in the Republic of Ireland don’t. But if we are going to be in two customs unions that is going to be incredibly hard to reconcile.”Speaking to MPs in the Commons earlier in the day, Johnson insisted that the whole of the UK would leave the EU’s customs union on 31 October and that this was a fundamental part of his vision for the country.Asked by the former cabinet minister Damian Green whether this would involve extra infrastructure anywhere on the island of Ireland, Johnson reassured him that it would not. “I can tell him that absolutely not. The proposals we are putting forward do not involve physical infrastructure at or near the border or indeed at any other place.”But an explanatory document tabled with the European commission appears to suggest there would be both a need to police the area to avoid smuggling and that customs checks would be carried out “at traders’ premises or other designated locations which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland”.

839,"Compromises always involve discomfort. In a typical negotiation, both sides can arrive at a compromise on the understanding that, for each of them, the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. It is the political and economic fragility of Northern Ireland that has made compromise between the UK and the EU, in the withdrawal agreement, necessary in the first place. Yet under Boris Johnson’s proposals for the Irish border, the discomfort caused by the compromise would be borne almost exclusively by this small region. As they currently stand, his plans indicate a British government more willing to compromise Northern Ireland than it is to compromise over Brexit.What Johnson has offered the European commission is unexpected: instead of an invidious choice between a hard border on the Irish Sea or one across the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland shall have both. The rub is that Johnson is handing the responsibility for this decision now to the EU – as if the effects of such borders (either with a deal or no deal) will be primarily Ireland’s problem and not one for the whole UK. His proposal persists with the illusion that Britain can have a cost-free Brexit, now enabled by putting the burden of managing the consequences on to the island of Ireland.This is clear from the two main dimensions of these proposals. First, regulatory alignment. Although Johnson claims that these proposals remove the so-called backstop, the most substantive part of it endures – and with bells on. Northern Ireland would effectively remain part of the EU’s single market for “all goods”. The critical difference between this and the backstop, however, is that it is not conditional. Northern Ireland shall be in a different regulatory zone to Britain regardless of the type of UK-EU relationship that is meant to be devised, miraculously quickly, by the end of the transition period.Second, the greatest and most immediate difficulty comes in the ratcheting up of the status of the Irish border into a customs border. Theresa May promised “no return to the borders of the past” on the island of Ireland. One border of the past that many people here remember vividly was a customs border. They remember the paperwork, the inconvenience, the delays, the targeting of customs officers. What they remember less is how the economy was transformed when the benefits of being part of the EU’s customs union could be married with the benefits of peace. It is all too easy for that to be reversed. The harder the Brexit, the more severe the impact of a customs border will be. What Johnson proposes will not protect Northern Ireland from these effects – it will, in fact, exacerbate them.The problem with the post-Brexit Irish border has always been managing the conundrum of avoiding making it a hard border (which would disrupt the conditions for peace, under the Good Friday agreement) while running it efficiently. Any customs border worth its salt needs to be managed well. You have to assure prospective partners for trade deals that negotiations are worth their while, because you don’t have leaky borders. You also need to assure local traders that their domestic market is protected against both smuggling and shoddy cheap imports, because the border is effective. If the Irish border is not run well – especially if the UK is determined on a hard Brexit – then smuggling not only becomes easier, it becomes more lucrative. The customs procedures outlined in the UK government’s proposals are not extraordinary, but neither are they a convincing means of border management in this unique context. In fact, what Johnson is putting forward as mitigating measures are pretty familiar at this stage, having been broadly outlined as long ago as August 2017, in the UK government’s white papers on customs and on Northern Ireland.They have worked elsewhere when they are used to help facilitate the movement of goods across a hard border. If there is no hard border, and no effective means of catching illegitimate operations, then the value and practicality of such measures dramatically decreases.“Alternative arrangements” to the backstop could in theory work for a customs border. But these would need to be carefully designed and developed over time, with input from those affected, and supported by proper resources. At this stage, therefore, the arrangements proposed can offer little more than legal uncertainty for the EU and worrying disruption for cross-border traders.In his letter to Jean-Claude Juncker, Johnson presents these proposals as, far from a final demand, “the basis for rapid negotiations towards a solution”. Any proposal that would avoid costs to Britain while placing Northern Ireland’s future as collateral cannot be allowed to be the last word on the matter.• Katy Hayward is reader in sociology at

862,"Business leaders have told Boris Johnson his Brexit plan risks causing severe damage to the Northern Ireland economy and has ramped up the chance of a no-deal departure.In an angry response to the prime minister’s plan to take Britain, including Northern Ireland, out of the customs union, representatives of companies in the province and across the UK said it put jobs and growth at risk. They also said it was likely to be rejected by Brussels, raising the chances of a no-deal Brexit that would harm firms across the country.Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said Johnson had not listened to businesses, that his plan was “unworkable and unpalatable” and would make Northern Irish goods less competitive.“The measures are predicated on intrusive surveillance, which will put a burden on business and be disruptive for border communities,” he added.Ian Wright, the chief executive of the UK Food and Drink Federation, said the plans would lead to added costs for companies. He said: “It would also be bad for consumers as it would become more expensive to move goods into Northern Ireland.”Northern Ireland’s economy is highly connected with the Republic under the EU customs union regime, with a trade in goods relationship worth about £5.2bn. About a third of goods and services exports are sold to the Republic, while about a quarter of its imports come from the Republic.Under Johnson’s plan, the movement of goods would require customs checks, though he says they could be limited by alternative arrangements such as electronic paperwork and a “very small number” of physical inspections at traders’ premises.Businesses, however, said the erection of border infrastructure and new customs checks could damage the economy, hampering job creation, economic growth and exports.Ann McGregor, the chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: “It is imperative that it does not happen even for a time limited period. Businesses are telling us that the potential increased costs will seriously damage business supply lines and indeed business survival.” However, Diageo, the drinks group which makes Guinness and Baileys, moves ingredients and bottles ready for sale across the Irish border multiple times a day. It suggested any increase in border checks would necessarily be very burdensome.Its beer goes from the St James’s Gate brewery in Dublin to a packaging operation in Belfast, while cream for Baileys comes from the Republic into Northern Ireland to be turned into the finished product, before being sent back for consolidation and export.Diageo had previously estimated a hard border could cost it £1.3m, based on an estimate of an hour’s delay for each of the 18,000 beer trucks that traverse the border each year.It now believes that the burden would be much lower than that thanks to the company’s status as a “trusted trader”, with any impediment likely to be administrative rather than involving lengthy physical delays.John Glen, economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, said about 40% of businesses were not ready for additional customs checks and that filling in forms away from the border could still result in disruption.“What if you turn up without the right documents? What happens if a lorry crosses the border without clearance? We’re a long way off being ready,” he said.• This article was amended on 3 October 2019 because an earlier version referred to 18,000 Diageo beer trucks traversing the border each day.

891,"The proposal is similar to Theresa May’s deal but with the Irish border backstop ripped up and replaced by his own plan, labelled “two borders for four years”.Under the plan the entire UK would leave the EU on 31 October with the original transition period staying in place until 31 December 2020.On the new Brexit day of 1 January 2021, Great Britain would leave all the institutions and structures of the EU including the customs union, which allows frictionless trade with all member states and all regulations on goods and food. It will also mean the UK exiting judicial structures including the European court of justice, security and defence arrangements and agreements such as data sharing.Northern Ireland would also leave the customs union on 20 December 2020. But it would remain aligned on regulations and, it is assumed, freedom of movement of people within the island of Ireland for another four years, until 2025.Yes. Goods coming into Northern Ireland would have to be checked to see if they complied with EU standards, which would apply across the island.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland. Interactive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderYes. But the Democratic Unionist party has said this is a pragmatic compromise to help get a deal over the line.If Northern Ireland maintains EU regulations on food and manufactured goods and freedom of movement, there would be no need for any checks on the Irish border. This is why Johnson thinks it is a winner.Yes. But the DUP believes it will work if after 2025 new structures are put in place to give Belfast and Dublin parliamentarians oversight of how Northern Ireland moves from there, with the option of remaining aligned to EU regulations a possibility. They see the restoration of the British-Irish ministerial council as vital to this, giving representatives from the Stormont assembly (assuming it is up and running again) and the Irish parliament a say on any changes of regulations on food and manufactured goods post-2025.At first sight, no. Infrastructure on the Irish border even after an effective transition period of four years is a red line for Ireland, which is concerned it would destabilise border communities that have flourished economically and socially since peace 21 years ago.The deadline for a deal is in 10 days’ time. This will give the European commission enough time to circulate the deal among EU member states for their approval or rejection before the next EU summit on 17 October. Normally, papers that are formally discussed are circulated one week before.The DUP says it has compromised, now Dublin and Brussels should budge too. Johnson has said the EU needs to show more flexibility.Under the Benn Act passed by MPs just before Johnson prorogued parliament, the prime minister must send a letter seeking an extension to article 50 until the end of January.

921,"Jeremy Corbyn will never step aside to allow an alternative candidate to lead a caretaker government because “the rules are the rules”, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said.Opposition leaders have held a series of meetings in recent weeks to discuss how to prevent a no-deal Brexit – and have not ruled out a vote of no confidence in the government if Boris Johnson tries to force through a no-deal departure on 31 October.If Johnson loses, some MPs believe an alternative government could be formed, to extend article 50, and perhaps to trigger an EU referendum before calling a general election.The Liberal Democrats leader, Jo Swinson, has suggested Corbyn would be unlikely to secure the necessary cross-party support and should step aside in favour of a less contentious candidate.Several other names have been mooted, including the former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett and the veteran Conservative Ken Clarke, who has had the whip removed for voting against the government.But Labour rejects that idea, believing that, as leader of the opposition, Corbyn is the clear alternative prime minister. Asked if someone other than Corbyn could lead such a government, McDonnell said: “No, the rules are the rules”.He suggested Swinson might change her mind, adding: “I’m a great believer in the powers of conversion.”A senior Labour source said: “People who want a government of national unity are playing fantasy football teams. It’s absolute, complete nonsense. Not only would no such thing ever be agreed, but the idea that such a government could exist for six months with no mandate is pure, utter nonsense.”Instead, Labour is determined to push for a general election as soon as a no-deal Brexit has been averted.Several Labour MPs at Monday night’s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party told Corbyn they would prefer a referendum to be held before a general election.That argument has previously been made by the deputy leader, Tom Watson, and the idea of attaching a “confirmatory” referendum to any Brexit deal the prime minister secures from the EU27 is again being discussed. But the Labour leader has repeatedly rejected that idea.Opposition MPs and Conservative rebels banded together last month to pass the Benn Act, aimed at forcing Johnson to request a Brexit delay if he fails to pass a deal by 19 October.But the MPs have widely differing views about how that extension should be used – with some hoping Brexit can be reversed, and others that the time could be used to negotiate a deal.Instead, Labour has mooted the idea that Corbyn could lead a caretaker government for a matter of days: just long enough to request an extension to article 50 and call a general election. The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has repeatedly made clear that his party could support that idea.Asked whether Swinson could change her mind and support a Corbyn-led government, a Lib Dem spokesman said: “Jo is a great believer in the power of mathematics. Jeremy Corbyn does not have the numbers and needs to make clear who he would support if we need an emergency government.”Corbyn stamped his authority on Labour’s Brexit policy at last week’s party conference in Brighton, persuading delegates to back his chosen course of fighting a general election, without picking in advance which side Labour would take in a future referendum.With the Conservatives poised to campaign on the slogan “Get Brexit done”, Corbyn’s allies are concerned that becoming a remain party would jeopardise votes in leave-supporting constituencies.But several key shadow ministers, including Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, have made clear they want the party to adopt a remain position.Thornberry was dropped as Corbyn’s regular stand-in for prime minister’s questions (PMQs) after criticising the party’s message in May’s European elections.With Johnson due to deliver his party conference speech in Manchester at the same time as PMQs on Wednesday, Dominic Raab will appear for the government – and Corbyn will be represented by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott.","Corbyn must lead any caretaker government, says McDonnell",2019-10-01/18:36:42,jeremy

925,"Dover could lose £1bn worth of trade a week if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the port has said.Doug Bannister, the chief executive at the port of Dover, told a fringe event at the Conservative conference that the government’s assumed drop in traffic under a no-deal scenario would cut £1bn a week from the flow of goods.He said the port had made extensive preparations for 31 October to function as usual but added: “That’s how critical it is. If there’s a no-deal Brexit, it’s not going to be OK. But people are doing all they can to ensure Britain keeps trading.”The transport minister, George Freeman, confirmed the government’s “planning assumption” was that no-deal disruption would roughly halve the traffic – a fall of 40%-60% – able to pass through Britain’s main trading link for three months.Dover handles £122bn a year by value, or 17% of the UK’s trade in goods. A fleet of 12 ferries carries more lorries than all other UK ports combined, on the shortest sea crossing between the UK and the EU. Freeman said he hoped goodwill would prevail if a deal was not agreed by 31 October, averting worst case disruption. Asked what preparations the government was making for “malign interventions”, such as a potential blockade by French fishermen, Freeman said he had seen cabinet papers showing that “the ministry of defence are actively looking at it”.The Freight Transport Association(FTA) said it did not expect “wholesale meltdown” but British consumers could expect to see less fresh produce. James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the FTA, said: “There will be changes to what people can expect to see in the shops, undoubtedly.”The FTA plan to hold 140 training sessions in the next few weeks to educate hauliers about the potential paperwork needed. Hookham said questions still remained unanswered, even with the intricate flowchart issued by the Department for Transport to explain customs and border processes.“The biggest unknown in our book is what the French and EU will demand in terms of British goods imported into the EU,” he said.Hookham added that the full impact of a no-deal Brexit on Dover, Calais and Kent would probably not be seen until 4 November, due to the public holiday on 1 November.",Dover could lose £1bn of trade a week with no-deal Brexit,2019-10-01/18:06:12,dover could lose bn worth of trade a week if britain leaves the eu without a deal the port has said doug bannister the chief executive at the port of dover told a fringe event at the conservative conference that the government s assumed drop in traffic under a no deal scenario would cut bn a week from the flow of goods he said the port had made extensive preparations for  october to function as usual but added that s how critical it is if there s a no deal brexit it s not going to be ok but people are doing all they can to ensure britain keeps trading the transport minister george freeman confirmed the government s planning assumption was that no deal disruption would roughly halve the traffic a fall of   able to pass through britain s main trading link for three months dover handles bn a year by value or  of the uk s trade in goods a fleet of  ferries carries more lorries than all other uk ports combined on the shortest sea crossing between the uk and the eu freeman said he hoped goodwill would prevail if a deal was not agreed by  october averting worst case disruption asked what preparations the government was making for malign interventions such as a potential blockade by french fishermen freeman said he had seen cabinet papers showing that the ministry of defence are actively looking at it the freight transport association fta said it did not expect wholesale meltdown but british consumers could expect to see less fresh produce james hookham the deputy chief executive of the fta said there will be changes to what people can expect to see in the shops undoubtedly the fta plan to hold  training sessions in the next few weeks to educate hauliers about the potential paperwork needed hookham said questions still remained unanswered even with the intricate flowchart issued by the department for transport to explain customs and border processes the biggest unknown in our book is what the french and eu will demand in terms of british goods imported into the eu he said hookham added that the full impact of a no deal brexit on dover calais and kent would probably not be seen until  november due to the public holiday on  november ,Brexit,0.177231133
934,"It is agreed by all that this is the moment of truth. When Michel Barnier privately warned the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, last Friday that he needed firm proposals imminently for a revised Brexit deal to have a chance of being agreed by leaders at an EU summit on 17 October, Barclay concurred, according to leaked minutes seen by the Guardian.For the UK to have a hope of ratification by 31 October, the gears in Whitehall needed to not merely whir but to mesh with the cogwheels in Brussels within days. During a blizzard of media rounds on Tuesday morning, Boris Johnson agreed that he would know by this weekend whether a deal was possible.The broad parameters of what the UK is proposing have started to become visible in recent days. The prime minister rightly points to his proposal of a single agri-food zone on the island of Ireland as a significant shift from his mantra during the Tory leadership campaign position that the Irish backstop had to be ditched in its entirety.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.Daniel BoffeyIndeed, Johnson has suggested that the single regulatory zone for agricultural goods should be permanent, citing Ian Paisley’s refrain that the people of Northern Ireland may be British but its cattle are Irish. This would avoid the need for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks on the Irish border for 30% of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and 70% of it by flow.EU sources say there are also signs that if a mechanism can be found for gaining the consent of the people of Northern Ireland then a temporary single-regulatory zone on the island of Ireland could be agreed for manufactured goods.It is understood that Barnier told Barclay on Friday that he was willing to talk about consent, or governance as the EU negotiator described it, once the UK government made its move on the scope of the single regulatory zone. They could jump together.Could that be the route to agreeing a time limit on regulatory alignment in manufactured goods? A role could be found for Stormont in agreeing to continued alignment after a period four years – up to the point by which the rest of the UK may be diverging. The “germ of an idea” of a single SPS zone, as Johnson described it, could be flowering into something more significant.But that leaves the big issue of customs – precisely the issue that tormented Theresa May.The government has been creditably clear that it will not sign up to a deal that leaves Northern Ireland outside its customs territory. May told the Commons that no British prime minister could agree to such a proposal and Johnson has said the whole of the UK must leave the EU as one customs territory.The customs non-paper submitted to the European commission by the UK has caused a kerfuffle because it spells out the logical consequence of that: customs checks and controls on the island of Ireland.The strawman reported by Irish broadcasters is a string of custom clearance centres five to 10 miles from the border. That has been an easy suggestion to knock back. The UK is instead looking at what it describes as a light-touch customs regime.The customs authorities would use GPS for the real-time tracking of goods and freight traffic over the border, with the paperwork carried out in advance.Trusted traders, and small and medium-sized businesses that benefit from exemptions, would in the most part cross through without trouble, but customs authorities would electronically flag those down who cause any concern. They could be asked to report to a designated centre or, more likely, be checked at their own premises.The UK has suggested the Republic of Ireland could mirror those arrangements, with close border control cooperation between customs authorities on both sides.But, if that is the big idea, this moment of truth is likely to be a sobering one. The EU says you cannot decouple customs and regulatory checks because it is through customs returns that goods are followed. It argues that the exemptions for many traders would open the door to smuggling. It is claimed that the supervision required in such circumstances would be destabilising to both the Irish economy and peace.So where to go next? The ratification of a deal will rely on a significant U-turn by Johnson, and a major concession by the EU. Johnson needs to accept that Northern Ireland will remain in the EU’s customs territory – but for a temporary period. Dublin needs to be persuaded that such a time limit is better than a no-deal Brexit now.There is no guarantee of success in parliament, despite some hopeful signs from the DUP and Tory Brexit “Spartans”.

954,"Boris Johnson’s secret plans to solve the Irish border Brexit challenge involve customs sites on both sides of the border and real-time tracking devices on lorries, it has been reported.The ideas, which mark a departure from his promise not to put infrastructure on the border, are part of four unofficial papers submitted by the UK to Brussels by Johnson’s team.The broadcaster RTÉ, which has had sight of the the tightly guarded proposals, is reporting that customs clearance sites would be sited five to 10 miles from the border to the north and the south to deal with imports and exports.Traders would have the choice of lodging their papers at these sites, similar to the ones that existed before the single market came into existence, or electing to be tracked electronically in an online “transit” arrangement.The idea of permanent clearance sites on both sides of the border, even five to 10 miles away, and real-time tracking of the movements of goods are unlikely to be supported by the Irish government.A spokesman for Downing Street said: “Nothing we are proposing involves checks or controls at the border. That is an absolute commitment.”A government source said the report was a misrepresentation of the “non-paper”, which discussed customs checks at place of origin or destination of goods.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland. Interactive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderIn the limited cases that inspections were needed, physical checks could be at dedicated premises, factories or production sites, the source suggested.But Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, dismissed the proposals as a “non-starter”, and called for a “serious proposal” from the UK.Non-Paper = Non-Starter. Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govt if a #Brexit deal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!Sinn Féin in Ireland and the Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland also dismissed the plans on Monday night. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said they were “absolutely out of the question”, while SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “It doesn’t matter if it’s a mile, five miles or 10 miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable.”Labour said the proposals were “utterly unworkable”. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “They would place an enormous administrative burden on businesses and rely on technology that does not yet exist.“Crucially, if true, they represent a rowing back on the commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland two years ago that there would be no return to a hard border or related checks or controls.”The leak comes as Johnson puts his finishing touches on formal written proposals expected to go to Brussels in the next week for a revised Brexit deal.Although all the indications are that a large gap remains in thinking, signs have emerged that the hardline position of the Conservative party’s most Eurosceptic backbenchers has softened just days before Boris Johnson’s team are due to enter a “tunnel” of secret negotiations with Brussels.Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, has opened the door to a potential Brexit deal, indicating he would look at one even if it included a version of the controversial Irish border backstop to which the Eurosceptic ERG was once implacably opposed.During a heated and sometimes bad-tempered event on the party conference fringe, he indicated that the “Spartan” wing of the party was in the mood for a deal.“It has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless. That’s not true,” he said referring to the bloc of 28 backbenchers who voted against Theresa May’s Brexit deal three times.“If there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully, because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. So I’ll look at a deal if there is one,” he said.Francois’ comments were seen as a subtle shift in approach for the ERG, whose support could unlock a deal for Johnson.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period.

If it really means we don’t, then I will vote against it and if we don’t no amount of browbeating will make me change my mind.”His remarks follow weeks of shifting mood over the Irish backstop. The Democratic Unionist party, which was implacably opposed to the backstop, has also indicated it was in the mood for a deal. It is understood that the DUP has been consulted on the plans that Johnson is to take to Brussels next week.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also hinted last week that there could be amendments to the withdrawal agreement but warned there was still a huge gap between the UK and Irish positions.The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said she would look at the possibility of a backstop with a time limit but warned that agreeing to consider one was not the same as “advocating” one.She told the Bruges Group: “It would be good to get rid of the iniquitous backstop” but added that it would be “good to get a deal”.She called for space to be given to negotiators, who now have fewer than 17 days to come up with a deal before the next EU summit.",Boris Johnson's 'secret Irish border plans' dismissed

1022,"The UK’s most senior civil servant is under pressure to investigate Boris Johnson’s financial backers following cross-party claims that unnamed individuals stand to benefit from the prime minister’s willingness to pursue a no-deal Brexit.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has written to the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, asking if there may be a conflict of interest in Johnson’s acceptance of support from hedge funds that could gain from an economic shock.Earlier on Saturday, Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, suggested Johnson was pursuing the interests of financial backers set to gain from a no-deal Brexit, in a major escalation of tensions in the prime minister’s own party.Hammond said he was repeating a comment made last week by Rachel Johnson, the prime minister’s sister.The former chancellor was accused by senior Tories of attempting a “smear” without evidence. However, Hammond was supported on Saturday by a series of MPs from across the Commons. “Johnson is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit – and there is only one option that works for them: a crash-out no-deal that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring,” Hammond wrote in the Times.Downing Street has refused to comment on the claim.Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister who was thrown out of the party for opposing a no-deal Brexit, said: “The dubious financiers who supported the ‘leave’ campaign and the prime minister’s leadership campaign are betting against Britain. The PM should put the interests of the country first rather than facilitating a financial bonanza for a few.”Anna Soubry, the leader of Change UK, said: “This week’s events are damning evidence that Boris Johnson has no moral compass. It gives me no pleasure to believe that Johnson is in hock to all manner of people and in particular those who don’t give a toss about the livelihoods of our constituents but simply get even more rich gambling on our children’s future.”However, the business minister Nadhim Zahawi said Hammond was peddling a conspiracy. “Philip you let yourself down by claiming speculators on ‘no deal’ are interfering in us leaving the EU,” he tweeted. “This is an ugly smear that is completely untrue. If you know anything about finance or the City then you will know that.”Hammond and his team have not named any individual donors. However, hedge fund managers have backed Johnson. One of those is Crispin Odey, a fund manager who has also previously backed Vote Leave and Ukip. Over the summer, it was reported that his fund had made a £300m bet against British businesses and stood to profit from an economic slump in the UK. However, the fund also backed other British companies. Odey did not respond to a request for comment.McDonnell said: “Given widespread concerns raised by the former chancellor Philip Hammond’s comment today about Johnson’s speculator sponsors profiteering from a no-deal Brexit, I am writing to Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, to seek a Cabinet Office investigation into this potential conflict of interest.”The conflict of interest code for members of the House of Commons states: “Given that service in parliament is a public trust … members are expected … to fulfil their public duties with honesty and uphold the highest standards so as to avoid real or apparent conflicts of interests, and maintain and enhance public confidence and trust in the integrity of each member and in the House of Commons.”",Calls for inquiry into claims Johnson backers benefit from no-deal Brexit,2019-09-28/17:06:27,the uk s most senior civil servant is under pressure to investigate boris johnson s financial backers following cross party claims that unnamed individuals stand to benefit from the prime minister s willingness to pursue a no deal brexit john mcdonnell the shadow chancellor has written to the cabinet secretary sir mark sedwill asking if there may be a conflict of interest in johnson s acceptance of support from hedge funds that could gain from an economic shock earlier on saturday philip hammond the former chancellor suggested johnson was pursuing the interests of financial backers set to gain from a no deal brexit in a major escalation of tensions in the prime minister s own party hammond said he was repeating a comment made last week by rachel johnson the prime minister s sister the former chancellor was accused by senior tories of attempting a smear without evidence however hammond was supported on saturday by a series of mps from across the commons johnson is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard brexit and there is only one option that works for them a crash out no deal that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring hammond wrote in the times downing street has refused to comment on the claim guto bebb a former tory minister who was thrown out of the party for opposing a no deal brexit said the dubious financiers who supported the leave campaign and the prime minister s leadership campaign are betting against britain the pm should put the interests of the country first rather than facilitating a financial bonanza for a few anna soubry the leader of change uk said this week s events are damning evidence that boris johnson has no moral compass it gives me no pleasure to believe that johnson is in hock to all manner of people and in particular those who don t give a toss about the livelihoods of our constituents but simply get even more rich gambling on our children s future however the business minister nadhim zahawi said hammond was peddling a conspiracy philip you let yourself down by claiming speculators on no deal are interfering in us leaving the eu he tweeted this is an ugly smear that is completely untrue if you know anything about finance or the city then you will know that hammond and his team have not named any individual donors however hedge fund managers have backed johnson one of those is crispin odey a fund manager who has also previously backed vote leave and ukip over the summer it was reported that his fund had made a m bet against british businesses and stood to profit from an economic slump in the uk however the fund also backed other british companies odey did not respond to a request for comment mcdonnell said given widespread concerns raised by the former chancellor philip hammond s comment today about johnson s speculator sponsors profiteering from a no deal brexit i am writing to mark sedwill the cabinet secretary to seek a cabinet office investigation into this potential conflict of interest the conflict of interest code for members of the house of commons states given that service in parliament is a public trust members are expected to fulfil their public duties with honesty and uphold the highest standards so as to avoid real or apparent conflicts of interests and maintain and enhance public confidence and trust in the integrity of each member and in the house of commons ,Brexit,0.234459817
1046,"A defiant Boris Johnson will use this weekend’s Tory conference in Manchester to double down on his “people v parliament” rhetoric, after a tumultuous week in which he was accused of dangerously inflaming political tensions.Downing Street insiders insist they have not been blown off course by the furious condemnation of Johnson’s repeated use of the phrase “surrender bill” to describe the backbench Benn Act.Instead, they claim they will use party conference to drive home their “Get Brexit Done” slogan, launch a string of manifesto-friendly policies – and attack Jeremy Corbyn as too weak to lead Britain.Johnson’s unapologetic stance comes after Amber Rudd joined the chorus of condemnation against his aggressive use of language, saying she was “disappointed and stunned”, and warning it could incite violence against opponents.The prime minister still hopes to press ahead with somehow securing a Brexit deal in the brief window remaining before the 17 October European Council – and push it through parliament, against the backdrop of political turmoil.Despite the horror with which many Labour MPs greeted Johnson’s bellicose performance in the Commons on Wednesday, No 10 still believes there will be intense pressure on those MPs who represent leave constituencies to support a deal.“If we came back with a deal, I think there would be real political pressure to really push through: if you’re in a Brexit seat, do you really want to go into an election having rejected Brexit?” the government source said.Meanwhile, Johnson will try and use his conference platform to attack parliament for attempting to thwart his negotiating strategy – and switch the focus back to domestic policy announcements, including on the NHS, law and order and the cost of living.Internal polling is telling the Tories that the prime minister is now more trusted than Corbyn on the NHS, and the Labour leader is regarded as weak – a message they plan to hammer home ruthlessly in the weeks ahead.They believe Johnson would perform well in head-to-head debates with Corbyn, despite their one clash at prime minister’s questions being widely regarded as a win for the Labour leader. “We’ll be cock a hoop,” said the government source. “We’ll have 10 a day, stick them in.”Theresa May also hoped to capitalise on questions about Corbyn’s leadership during the 2017 general election campaign, at one point warning he would go “naked into the negotiating chamber” for Brexit talks. But the electorate responded by stripping the Tories of their majority.Labour strategists are battling to find the best way of burnishing Corbyn’s anti-establishment credentials, as Johnson tries to paint himself as the champion of the people against scheming MPs. They say the slogan “people v privilege”, trailed at Labour conference in Brighton, strikes a chord with voters in focus groups.Rudd, who quit the government and resigned the Conservative whip earlier this month in protest at the prime minister’s policies, also told the Evening Standard that she might stand in London as an “independent Conservative” at the next general election.Amid bitter complaints about Johnson’s use of words such as “surrender” and “betrayal” over Brexit, and his subsequent refusal to apologise, Rudd said she had been “disappointed and stunned” when the PM dismissed the fears of female MPs about a possible repeat of the 2016 murder of Jo Cox.Asked about the Downing Street approach of couching Brexit as a battle between the people and a remain-minded parliament, Rudd said: “The sort of language I’m afraid we’ve seen more and more of coming out from No 10 does incite violence. It’s the sort of language people think legitimises a more aggressive approach and sometimes violence.”Comparing Johnson’s approach to that of Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential election, Rudd said “the casual approach to safety of MPs and their staff [was] immoral”, and urged ministers to “consider their own judgments rather than be desperately loyal”.Rudd is not planning to attend conference; but some of the other 21 rebels who had the whip removed for voting for the Benn Act do plan to attend, including former justice secretary David Gauke.The House of Commons voted against granting the government a three-day break so that conference could be held; but Johnson plans to press ahead, leaving one junior “duty minister” for each department behind in London.He is expected to deliver his set-piece conference speech as planned on Wednesday, leaving Dominic Raab to stand in for prime minister’s questions back in London.Meanwhile opposition MPs hoping to thwart Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy will spend next week working on a fresh anti no-deal action plan.If the prime minister breaks the terms of the Benn Act, which compels him to ask for an extension to Article 50 if he can’t get a Brexit deal, they want to be able to implement a plan “within minutes”.The legislation, spearheaded by Labour MP Hilary Benn, and backed by Labour and rebel ex-Tories including former chancellor Phillip Hammond, demands that the prime minister ask Brussels for an extension to the Brexit process by 19 October if he has not brokered a new agreement.However, they insist they will not seek to wreck the Tory conference by attempting to take over the order paper, or table new laws and emergency debates.In the first vote Johnson faces as prime minister, 21 rebel Tory MPs vote with the opposition to seize control of the order paper to allow a debate on a bill that would block a no-deal Brexit. Against Johnson's wishes, the Commons passes  by 329 votes to 300 the second reading of the European Union (withdrawal) (No 6) bill proposed by Hilary Benn.Later the same day the Benn bill passes the third and final reading needed to become law, this time by 327 to 299 votes.Johnson responds by attempting to force an early general election. The 298 MPs who support him are short of the two-thirds majority required by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, making it a third defeat in a single day for the government.Dominic Grieve's bid to force the government to release documents related to the Operation Yellowhammer no-deal planning and on the decision to prorogue parliament defeats Johnson by 311 to 302.Johnson's second call for an early general election is supported by 293 MPs, still short of the two-thirds majority required. Parliament is prorogued and MPs briefly occupy the chamber after the session is closed. The supreme court rules that Johnson's closure of parliament was unlawful and that MPs must return.In the first vote in the reconvened House of Commons, MPs vote by 306 to 289 against a three-day recess to allow Conservative MPs to attend their party conference.On a rare Saturday sitting of parliament, the government loses a vote on the ‘Letwin amendment’ by 322 votes to 306. It withholds approval of the prime minister’s deal until the legislation to enact it - the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - is passed.Having won with a 30-vote majority to move his Withdrawal Agreement Bill to the second reading stage, Johnson immediately lost the government’s so-called programme motion, which set out the accelerated timetable for the bill, by 308 votes in favour to 322 against.Instead, they are expected to pepper ministers with a host of urgent questions instead. A source close to the rebels said: “Next week is all about planning scenarios for if Boris Johnson breaks the law.”“It’s going to be the cross-party group meeting to work out what action could be taken in the event Johnson does break the law.”They said this could involve legislation but have also not ruled out another confidence vote in the Prime Minister, that could in theory trigger a general election.Meetings among the group of politicians working to stop no-deal, including Labour’s shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, the then Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster David Lidington and former chancellor Philip Hammond, representatives of the Liberal Democrats and SNP took place as early as June.",Defiant Johnson will not tone down rhetoric at Tory

1098,"Brexit party members earn more from second jobs than any other group in the European parliament, according to transparency campaigners who are warning about potential conflicts of interest.An annual study by Transparency International showed that Nigel Farage is no longer the best-paid British MEP by second job. Now in seventh place among the 227 MEPs with outside earnings, Farage earns about €360,000 (£319,000) a year from his media company, Thorn in the Side.The Brexit party’s London member Ben Habib is the EU’s best-paid MEP. Elected in May, Habib declared €960,000 annual earnings from First Property Group, the property fund manager he founded.Three other Brexit party MEPs make the top 10 ahead of Farage. At No 3 is Ann Widdecombe, who declared a second income of €240,000-€480,000 a year. The former Tory minister and reality TV contestant makes between €5,000 and €10,000 a month writing her Daily Express column, with a further €20,000 a month coming in from speaking and broadcasting.The Brexit party chairman, Richard Tice, has annual earnings of between €264,000 and €360,000 from his business interests.In 12th place is the Conservative Brexit evangelist Daniel Hannan, who is paid at least €5,000 a month to advise the machinery manufacturer JCB. Chaired by the Brexit-supporting Lord Bamford, JCB paid Boris Johnson £10,000 in January and has also had the former Brexit secretary David Davis on the payroll.Another prominent name in the top 10 is the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, who earns between €180,000 and €426,000 for sitting on company boards and giving speeches.All the outside earnings figures cited were before tax. Transparency International said the Brexit party contingent were “the top earners by a long way”, with its 28 MEPs earning a total of between €2m and €4.7m on top of their monthly MEP salaries of €6,825 after tax.The exact figures are unknown, as MEPs are only required to declare outside earnings in approximate amounts. The study reports MEPs annual earnings, but if Brexit goes ahead on 31 October, British MEPs would have sat for only four months of the current five-year term.About a third of the parliament’s 748 sitting MEPs declared income from second jobs.“Based on some of the details, including in some of the declarations of the Brexit party, it is impossible to judge what some of these companies are engaged in and therefore the exercise of determining if there is a potential conflict of interest is impossible to undertake,” said Nick Aiossa of Transparency International’s Brussels office. “Particularly with the sums of money involved with the Brexit party.”The group argues that the current system is too lax, fears fuelled by revelations that Farage failed to declare lavish funding from the Brexit tycoon Arron Banks.Aiossa said that MEPs breaking the European parliament’s code of conduct in previous years had never faced sanctions. “There is simply no deterrent for MEPs to take this exercise seriously,” he said. “Until there is a sanctions regime that accompanies an ethics reform … we will continue to see declarations that are misleading, incomplete or fail to record [important details].”The Brexit party did not respond directly to questions about a potential conflict of interest, but issued a statement from the West Midlands MEP Rupert Lowe, who has the fourth-highest income from a second job. He earns between €204,000 and €444,000 from companies including a business running cancer treatment centres and another involved in solar energy.“Isn’t it wonderful that Brexit party MEPs earn more money than arch-federalist Guy Verhofstadt, and get a lot more votes than him as well,” said Lowe, who is one place ahead of the Belgian MEP.“Many Brexit party MEPs are successful in the work that they do, the decisions they make, and the earnings list reflects that fact. It’s important that voters who wish to attain the goal of leaving the EU have capable, experienced people to represent them to the best of their ability.”A spokesman for Verhofstadt said he had “nothing against the establishment of an ethics body as proposed [by Transparency International]”.","Brexit party MEPs are EU's biggest earners in second jobs, study finds",2019-09-26/15:23:37,brexit party members earn more from second jobs than any other group in the european parliament according to transparency campaigners who are warning about potential conflicts of interest an annual study by transparency international showed that nigel farage is no longer the best paid british mep by second job now in seventh place among the  meps with outside earnings farage earns about     a year from his media company thorn in the side the brexit party s london member ben habib is the eu s best paid mep elected in may habib declared   annual earnings from first property group the property fund manager he founded three other brexit party meps make the top  ahead of farage at no  is ann widdecombe who declared a second income of     a year the former tory minister and reality tv contestant makes between   and   a month writing her daily express column with a further   a month coming in from speaking and broadcasting the brexit party chairman richard tice has annual earnings of between   and   from his business interests in th place is the conservative brexit evangelist daniel hannan who is paid at least   a month to advise the machinery manufacturer jcb chaired by the brexit supporting lord bamford jcb paid boris johnson   in january and has also had the former brexit secretary david davis on the payroll another prominent name in the top  is the european parliament s brexit coordinator guy verhofstadt who earns between   and   for sitting on company boards and giving speeches all the outside earnings figures cited were before tax transparency international said the brexit party contingent were the top earners by a long way with its  meps earning a total of between m and  m on top of their monthly mep salaries of   after tax the exact figures are unknown as meps are only required to declare outside earnings in approximate amounts the study reports meps annual earnings but if brexit goes ahead on  october british meps would have sat for only four months of the current five year term about a third of the parliament s  sitting meps declared income from second jobs based on some of the details including in some of the declarations of the brexit party it is impossible to judge what some of these companies are engaged in and therefore the exercise of determining if there is a potential conflict of interest is impossible to undertake said nick aiossa of transparency international s brussels office particularly with the sums of money involved with the brexit party the group argues that the current system is too lax fears fuelled by revelations that farage failed to declare lavish funding from the brexit tycoon arron banks aiossa said that meps breaking the european parliament s code of conduct in previous years had never faced sanctions there is simply no deterrent for meps to take this exercise seriously he said until there is a sanctions regime that accompanies an ethics reform we will continue to see declarations that are misleading incomplete or fail to record important details the brexit party did not respond directly to questions about a potential conflict of interest but issued a statement from the west midlands mep rupert lowe who has the fourth highest income from a second job he earns between   and   from companies including a business running cancer treatment centres and another involved in solar energy isn t it wonderful that brexit party meps earn more money than arch federalist guy verhofstadt and get a lot more votes than him as well said lowe who is one place ahead of the belgian mep many brexit party meps are successful in the work that they do the decisions they make and the earnings list reflects that fact it s important that voters who wish to attain the goal of leaving the eu have capable experienced people to represent them to the best of their ability a spokesman for verhofstadt said he had nothing against the establishment of an ethics body as proposed by transparency international ,Brexit,0.121714242
1156,"European media had few words harsh enough for a British prime minister they portrayed as unscrupulous, autocratic and dishonest – and few warm enough for the judges whose defence of British parliamentary democracy had brought him low.Germany’s Die Zeit said the supreme court’s ruling that Boris Johnson’s five-week suspension of parliament was unlawful was “devastating” for the prime minister. In fact, it said, “all that is left for him is to resign. Unfortunately, he has repeatedly shown over the past few months that law and order are of little interest to him.”There may never have been a British prime minister who has sought to overrule the primacy of parliament like Johnson, the paper said, “a prime minister who has lied to the people, parliament and the crown, and abuses his power without a care”.Johnson is simply “not the right person to lead Britain in such a major crisis”, it concluded. “If Brexit is not done legally and in accordance with the constitution, Britain will never find peace. The people must now decide what they want, either in the form of new elections or a second referendum.”Die Welt said the judges’ decision had “erupted like a volcano”. Johnson, defeated multiple times in parliament, had now lost, heavily, before the law. “One wonders whether and how he can continue, at the head of a minority government and discredited by the supreme court,” it said.Handelsblatt said the judges’ verdict was “crushing, and unanimous”. The court’s reasoning was laid out with “incorruptible, merciless logic and in the end, its verdict seemed inevitable – and the government’s argument was pulverised”.Above and beyond the consequences for Johnson and Brexit, the ruling showed Britain needs a written constitution. “Otherwise unscrupulous leaders like Johnson can abuse it anytime. Parliament must be able to decide for itself when it meets.”In a stinging editorial, the Irish Times said a central plank of Johnson’s “carefully cultivated self-image” had always been the claim that “behind the buffoonish exterior was a skilful, serious-minded tactician … But in just two months in Downing St, that illusion has unravelled. Johnson, it is painfully clear, is winging it.”The paper said the ruling was his “biggest humiliation of all”. The judges had “broken new constitutional ground” with their “powerful assertion of parliamentary sovereignty and robust rebuke to those who trample on it”, and their decision had left Johnson “backed into a corner, his options narrowing and his time running out.”.In France, Le Monde said the word “historic” was no exaggeration: “The supreme court has taken a decision that will stay long in the annals of British politics,” it said. Certainly, the ruling was “a monumental blow to Boris Johnson, whose authority now seems seriously weakened”.But beyond that, in a country without a written constitution, the court’s 11 judges “made history by considerably reinforcing British parliamentary democracy, and defining very clearly the balance of powers between parliament and government”.The paper said the decision made the prospect of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October even more unlikely. “How, after such a heavy judicial defeat, could Johnson defy the law obliging him to seek a delay if there is no agreement with Brussels by 18 October?”Libération said the most likely scenario now was probably “a vote of no confidence leading to fresh elections and, of course, to a new Brexit delay”. Johnson, however, is still insisting that the UK “will leave the EU on 31 October, come what may”.British prime ministers, the paper said, “have all, these past three years, been afflicted with the same syndrome: that of endlessly repeating the same empty phrases without ever resolving Brexit – whose outcome, despite all the political drama, has still not been found.”Spain’s El País said in an editorial an “autocratic and populist ruler” had been severely admonished for attacking parliamentary democracy. The 11 supreme court judges had done “great service to the cause of democracy, far beyond the borders of their small Atlantic island”, it said.In the Netherlands, De Volkskrant said “few had expected such a unanimous and harsh judgement, which was hailed as a victory for the rule of law”. Johnson and his top adviser, Dominic Cummings, had been reminded in no uncertain terms by 11 judges that their “people versus the established order” strategy “may work for a campaign like Vote Leave, but running a country is different”, it said.But, the paper added, the judges’ spectacular statement was “not a solution to the political crisis”. The prime minister has no majority in parliament, but “at the same time, parliament is reluctant to let the government fall for fear of new elections and the risk that the UK will fall out of the EU without a deal”.",'A monumental blow': European papers respond to Boris Johnson's defeat in court,2019-09-25/10:16:58,european media had few words harsh enough for a british prime minister they portrayed as unscrupulous autocratic and dishonest and few warm enough for the judges whose defence of british parliamentary democracy had brought him low germany s die zeit said the supreme court s ruling that boris johnson s five week suspension of parliament was unlawful was devastating for the prime minister in fact it said all that is left for him is to resign unfortunately he has repeatedly shown over the past few months that law and order are of little interest to him there may never have been a british prime minister who has sought to overrule the primacy of parliament like johnson the paper said a prime minister who has lied to the people parliament and the crown and abuses his power without a care johnson is simply not the right person to lead britain in such a major crisis it concluded if brexit is not done legally and in accordance with the constitution britain will never find peace the people must now decide what they want either in the form of new elections or a second referendum die welt said the judges decision had erupted like a volcano johnson defeated multiple times in parliament had now lost heavily before the law one wonders whether and how he can continue at the head of a minority government and discredited by the supreme court it said handelsblatt said the judges verdict was crushing and unanimous the court s reasoning was laid out with incorruptible merciless logic and in the end its verdict seemed inevitable and the government s argument was pulverised above and beyond the consequences for johnson and brexit the ruling showed britain needs a written constitution otherwise unscrupulous leaders like johnson can abuse it anytime parliament must be able to decide for itself when it meets in a stinging editorial the irish times said a central plank of johnson s carefully cultivated self image had always been the claim that behind the buffoonish exterior was a skilful serious minded tactician but in just two months in downing st that illusion has unravelled johnson it is painfully clear is winging it the paper said the ruling was his biggest humiliation of all the judges had broken new constitutional ground with their powerful assertion of parliamentary sovereignty and robust rebuke to those who trample on it and their decision had left johnson backed into a corner his options narrowing and his time running out in france le monde said the word historic was no exaggeration the supreme court has taken a decision that will stay long in the annals of british politics it said certainly the ruling was a monumental blow to boris johnson whose authority now seems seriously weakened but beyond that in a country without a written constitution the court s  judges made history by considerably reinforcing british parliamentary democracy and defining very clearly the balance of powers between parliament and government the paper said the decision made the prospect of a no deal brexit on  october even more unlikely how after such a heavy judicial defeat could johnson defy the law obliging him to seek a delay if there is no agreement with brussels by  october libération said the most likely scenario now was probably a vote of no confidence leading to fresh elections and of course to a new brexit delay johnson however is still insisting that the uk will leave the eu on  october come what may british prime ministers the paper said have all these past three years been afflicted with the same syndrome that of endlessly repeating the same empty phrases without ever resolving brexit whose outcome despite all the political drama has still not been found spain s el país said in an editorial an autocratic and populist ruler had been severely admonished for attacking parliamentary democracy the  supreme court judges had done great service to the cause of democracy far beyond the borders of their small atlantic island it said in the netherlands de volkskrant said few had expected such a unanimous and harsh judgement which was hailed as a victory for the rule of law johnson and his top adviser dominic cummings had been reminded in no uncertain terms by  judges that their people versus the established order strategy may work for a campaign like vote leave but running a country is different it said but the paper added the judges spectacular statement was not a solution to the political crisis the prime minister has no majority in parliament but at the same time parliament is reluctant to let the government fall for fear of new elections and the risk that the uk will fall out of the eu without a deal ,Brexit,0.237068132
1158,"Jeremy Corbyn has called for Boris Johnson to apologise to the Queen and the country for unlawfully suspending parliament to stop scrutiny of his Brexit strategy.The Labour leader said the prime minister had abused the powers he has of the use of the royal prerogative and this was a very, very serious matter.Speaking on the BBC Today programme, Corbyn said it should have been obvious that it was a “pretty risky” decision to suspend parliament and reiterated his call for Johnson to resign.“I think he should apologise to her [the Queen] for the advice he gave her and more importantly he should apologise to the British people for what he has done in trying to shut down our democracy at a crucial time when people are worried about what will happen on 31 October,” he said.“Thanks to the supreme court, we now have parliament meeting again today and we will once again be able to question the government in what it is actually doing in taking us out of the EU without a deal, with all the damage that will do to people’s jobs and livelihoods,” he added.Despite his calls for Johnson to resign, Corbyn said he would only move to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister when it was clear that a no-deal Brexit was off the table.“Quite simply our first priority is to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October,” he said.Michael Gove, the minister responsible for no-deal planning, took a defiant tone on the judgment on Tuesday morning, saying he respected the supreme court ruling but did not agree with it.Asked whether the government had been wrong to prorogue parliament, Gove said: “I don’t think so.”“I don’t think the government should apologise for having a strong domestic agenda or seeking to ring about or exit from the European Union,” he added.Gove also denied widespread reports that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, had in cabinet criticised the judgment as a “constitutional coup”, saying he did not recognise that language.Elsewhere, the government was sending mixed messages on its response to the judgment, with a senior No 10 source briefing the view that judges had made a mistake, while Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, called for the independence of the judges to be respected.“It is important, once again, to emphasise that these cases are not about when and on what terms the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union. They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.”“The first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister’s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.““It prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees…This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.”“The court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.““This court has already concluded that the prime minister’s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.”“It is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.”The full judgment and the summary judgment can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.Parliament will reconvene at 11.30am on Wednesday, with all parties whipping their MPs to be there.Opposition parties are likely to start making moves to hold the government to account through motions that would seek to gain control of the Commons order paper and possibly a motion or humble address to get publication of the attorney general’s legal advice on prorogation.The government will shortly want to table a motion to secure a short recess for the Tory party conference but the vote may be lost by the government as Johnson no longer has a majority.Corbyn said Labour would vote against parliament breaking up again at such a crucial time for

not recognise that language elsewhere the government was sending mixed messages on its response to the judgment with a senior no  source briefing the view that judges had made a mistake while robert buckland the justice secretary called for the independence of the judges to be respected it is important once again to emphasise that these cases are not about when and on what terms the united kingdom is to leave the european union they are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to her majesty the queen on  or  august that parliament should be prorogued from a date between  and  september until  october was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not the first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister s advice to her majesty is justiciable this court holds that it is the courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries it prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on  october proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess while parliament is prorogued neither house can meet debate or pass legislation neither house can debate government policy nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees this prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the united kingdom on  october parliament and in particular the house of commons as the elected representatives of the people has a right to a voice in how that change comes about the effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme the court is bound to conclude therefore that the decision to advise her majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification this court has already concluded that the prime minister s advice to her majesty was unlawful void and of no effect this means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful void and of no effect and should be quashed this means that when the royal commissioners walked into the house of lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper the prorogation was also void and of no effect parliament has not been prorogued this is the unanimous judgment of all  justices it is for parliament and in particular the speaker and the lord speaker to decide what to do next unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible it is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister but if it is the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court the full judgment and the summary judgment can be downloaded from the supreme court website parliament will reconvene at  am on wednesday with all parties whipping their mps to be there opposition parties are likely to start making moves to hold the government to account through motions that would seek to gain control of the commons order paper and possibly a motion or humble address to get publication of the attorney general s legal advice on prorogation the government will shortly want to table a motion to secure a short recess for the tory party conference but the vote may be lost by the government as johnson no longer has a majority corbyn said labour would vote against parliament breaking

1185,"The UK supreme court ruling against Boris Johnson was celebrated in EU capitals and has left Brussels convinced that the prime minister has lost control of events and will not be able to crash Britain out on 31 October.As Lady Hale, the president of the UK’s highest court, read out its unanimous judgment, politicians, officials and diplomats involved in the Brexit talks spoke of their reassurance about the state of the rule of law in the UK.The decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks in order to avoid parliamentary scrutiny had already provoked criticism by senior politicians in the European parliament, and the court’s confirmation on Tuesday that Johnson’s move was unlawful was welcomed.Guy Verhofstadt, the EU parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “At least one big relief in the Brexit saga: the rule of law in the UK is alive & kicking.“Parliaments should never be silenced in a real democracy. I never want to hear Boris Johnson or any other Brexiteer say again that the European Union is undemocratic.”The European parliament’s speaker, David Sassoli, said: “Important decision from UK supreme court to rule prorogation of parliament as unlawful.“Any Brexit agreement needs to be approved by both UK and EU parliament, so proper democratic scrutiny on both sides of the Channel is essential.”The chair of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee, Norbert Röttgen, who is a senior member of Angela Merkel’s CDU party, expressed his satisfaction at the judgment.He said: “It is not my place to comment on judicial proceedings in Britain. But as a fellow MP I do feel the need to express my joy and solidarity with British parliamentarians.”A former head of the EU council’s legal service, Jean-Claude Piris, tweeted: “It gives me good and emotional feelings too.“It was so sad to see this great country at the risk of being led to no longer respect the principles and values upon which its democratic institutions have been built over centuries.”But sources said it was also clear now that Johnson had little hope of presenting MPs with the choice of leaving, “do or die”, with or without a deal on 31 October.The prime minister is seemingly constrained by the Benn Act, which would instruct him to seek an extension if a deal is not agreed with the EU and backed by the Commons, but Johnson had suggested he would find a way around the law.The ruling has confirmed to Brussels that parliament is in the driving seat and able to instruct the prime minister as it wishes over the coming weeks, with an increased chance of a general election next month, and a reduced possibility of a deal being agreed and passed by the Commons next month.One EU diplomat said: “Another domestic in this long Brexit saga. Parliament hasn’t been able to formulate a position in the last three years so why would they suddenly now?“Without decisive action their government is driving this process off the cliff. But seeing as Brexit was about the sovereignty of parliament it was bewildering that government moved to suspend it. So much about this process is contradictory and utterly mind-blowing.”EU officials think the court ruling has increased the chances of an extension request from the UK. “Are the chances of an extension request probably very high? Yes,” said one source. “And has the court’s judgment made the chances higher? Cautiously yes. And is the EU banging its head against a brick wall saying: ‘When is this going to stop?’ Absolutely.”Fabian Zuleeg, the chief executive of the European Policy Centre thinktank, tweeted: “Conclusions? 31 October no deal unlikely unless Boris Johnson is willing to break law and won’t be stopped.“So Boris Johnson only has two real options: resign and fight election on clear no-deal stance or make deal, capitulating in negotiations. Former looks more likely but unlikely to bring resolution.”The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the issue was an “internal matter” for the UK. “Whoever is prime minister of the United Kingdom is somebody we’re going to work with,” he said. “It’s not for us to decide who the prime minister of the UK is.”Asked whether the ruling would impact on the EU’s trust in Johnson, a European commission spokeswoman said: “We have all seen the news but it is not for us to comment on the internal constitutional matters of the United Kingdom. Our interlocutor is the United Kingdom government and that remains the case. All other judgments I leave to you.”","Supreme court ruling makes no-deal scenario less likely, EU believes",2019-09-24/16:05:05,the uk supreme court ruling against boris johnson was celebrated in eu capitals and has left brussels convinced that the prime minister has lost control of events and will not be able to crash britain out on  october as lady hale the president of the uk s highest court read out its unanimous judgment politicians officials and diplomats involved in the brexit talks spoke of their reassurance about the state of the rule of law in the uk the decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks in order to avoid parliamentary scrutiny had already provoked criticism by senior politicians in the european parliament and the court s confirmation on tuesday that johnson s move was unlawful was welcomed guy verhofstadt the eu parliament s brexit coordinator tweeted at least one big relief in the brexit saga the rule of law in the uk is alive kicking parliaments should never be silenced in a real democracy i never want to hear boris johnson or any other brexiteer say again that the european union is undemocratic the european parliament s speaker david sassoli said important decision from uk supreme court to rule prorogation of parliament as unlawful any brexit agreement needs to be approved by both uk and eu parliament so proper democratic scrutiny on both sides of the channel is essential the chair of the bundestag s foreign affairs committee norbert röttgen who is a senior member of angela merkel s cdu party expressed his satisfaction at the judgment he said it is not my place to comment on judicial proceedings in britain but as a fellow mp i do feel the need to express my joy and solidarity with british parliamentarians a former head of the eu council s legal service jean claude piris tweeted it gives me good and emotional feelings too it was so sad to see this great country at the risk of being led to no longer respect the principles and values upon which its democratic institutions have been built over centuries but sources said it was also clear now that johnson had little hope of presenting mps with the choice of leaving do or die with or without a deal on  october the prime minister is seemingly constrained by the benn act which would instruct him to seek an extension if a deal is not agreed with the eu and backed by the commons but johnson had suggested he would find a way around the law the ruling has confirmed to brussels that parliament is in the driving seat and able to instruct the prime minister as it wishes over the coming weeks with an increased chance of a general election next month and a reduced possibility of a deal being agreed and passed by the commons next month one eu diplomat said another domestic in this long brexit saga parliament hasn t been able to formulate a position in the last three years so why would they suddenly now without decisive action their government is driving this process off the cliff but seeing as brexit was about the sovereignty of parliament it was bewildering that government moved to suspend it so much about this process is contradictory and utterly mind blowing eu officials think the court ruling has increased the chances of an extension request from the uk are the chances of an extension request probably very high yes said one source and has the court s judgment made the chances higher cautiously yes and is the eu banging its head against a brick wall saying when is this going to stop absolutely fabian zuleeg the chief executive of the european policy centre thinktank tweeted conclusions  october no deal unlikely unless boris johnson is willing to break law and won t be stopped so boris johnson only has two real options resign and fight election on clear no deal stance or make deal capitulating in negotiations former looks more likely but unlikely to bring resolution the irish taoiseach leo varadkar said the issue was an internal matter for the uk whoever is prime minister of the united kingdom is somebody we re going to work with he said it s not for us to decide who the prime minister of the uk is asked whether the ruling would impact on the eu s trust in johnson a european commission spokeswoman said we have all seen the news but it is not for us to comment on the internal constitutional matters of the united kingdom our interlocutor is the united kingdom government and that remains the case all other judgments i leave to you ,Brexit,0.212964118

You can also catch our latest Brexit Means … podcast here, and for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Brexit is just over a month away and despite repeated claims by the government that progress is being made on changes to the withdrawal deal that might somehow make it acceptable to MPs, there’s still no evidence to suggest that’s actually the case.In a speech in Strasbourg the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, demanded operable proposals, in writing, from the UK on replacing the Irish backstop and warned a no-deal exit was now a “palpable risk”.Finland, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, and France said whatever Britain did come up with would have to be tabled within a fortnight so it could be properly discussed by the EU27 before next month’s summit.But it emerged that Boris Johnson had been “taken aback” during his meeting with Juncker last week at the scale and complexity of the potential problems on the border, and the extent to which Britain’s sketchy ideas have failed to address them.In a speech in Madrid that went down like a lead balloon, Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay said the “purist” EU would have to “take risks” with the Irish border for a deal to be struck, demanding more flexibility and compromise from the bloc.The government said it would present its plans when it was ready, and then angered the EU27 by insisting that the papers it finally submitted – dismissed in Brussels as still “very far” from what was required – must not be circulated.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, later described the British solution for replacing the backstop as unacceptable, adding that the UK government’s position would have to change for there to be any hope of success.Meanwhile, the supreme court heard arguments in London for and against Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament until 14 October, including allegations that the mother of parliaments had been “shut down by the father of lies” and that the government’s stated reasons for the prorogation were misleading.No 10 said it could not rule out proroguing parliament again if it loses the potentially explosive case, while the judges were urged to encourage the speakers of the Commons and Lords to reconvene the parliamentary session. The verdict should come on Tuesday morning (see below).As the prime minister headed to a UN climate summit in New York, where he was due to meet European leaders saying he was “cautiously optimistic” he could negotiate a deal with EU leaders, Labour continued to tear itself to pieces over its Brexit policy.Jeremy Corbyn wanted to “stay neutral” and let the people decide in a referendum; activists pushed for a campaign to remain; the party conference was plunged into Brexit disarray and then into downright chaos.In the end, Corbyn won: delegates rejected a motion that would have obliged Labour to adopt an out-and-out remain position before a general election.In the short term, all eyes are on the supreme court, whose verdict on whether Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was lawful or not is expected on Tuesday morning.A ruling against the government could trigger a “constitutional eruption of volcanic proportions”, one legal expert said, with much depending on how the court framed such a decision – particularly if it determines that Johnson misled the Queen.Past that, the crucial problem facing the prime minister is whether or not he can solve the riddle of the Irish backstop and thus wring a deal from the EU (he would then have to get it through parliament, of course, but that’s for another day).At the moment the two sides have starkly different visions of what the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol need to guarantee.Britain has proposed Northern Ireland stays under EU rules for agri-food but that otherwise there be two regulatory zones on the island, with some checks on goods necessary albeit facilitated by technology. The EU wants to secure full frictionless trade across the island in order to maintain the status quo.At present, there is little sign of any meaningful rapprochement.UK regions most exposed to no-deal Brexit also most deprived, warns study.Health cover for retired Britons in EU to last six months in no-deal Brexit.No-deal Brexit will have “seismic” impact, says European car industry.English people living in Wales tilted it towards Brexit, research finds.Arlene Foster signals DUP shift on Northern Ireland border issue.Interest rate cut more likely due to Brexit uncertainty, says Bank.No-deal Brexit will cut 3% off UK economic growth, says OECD.Hard Brexit would put officers’ lives at risk, says Northern Ireland police chief.Importers stockpile alcohol for Christmas to avoid Brexit drought.Polish ambassador urges Poles to “seriously consider” leaving UK.In the Guardian, Jonathan Lis argues that the language of Brexit “betrayal” is poisoning politics:Our fundamental problem is we have lost the ability to distinguish between compromise and betrayal. We now confront a situation in which language proves as dangerous as policy.Politicians can no longer merely disagree. They must be acting in bad faith, or subverting democracy, or betraying the electorate. This finds its extreme form in the word “treason”, which now peppers and pollutes the language of rightwing politicians and commentators. But it has also insinuated itself into the way we address Brexit altogether.The essential toxin here is the requirement for political purity. This is partly driven by the increasing radicalism of our mainstream political parties and partly by the appetite for nationalism unleashed by the referendum and now rapidly advancing.Britain is no longer just riven politically and economically, but fully entrenched in a culture war which demands rigid and extreme conceptions of identity. This new polarisation necessitates an all-or-nothing stance not just on Brexit, but on politics altogether.

1218,"The Labour leader has set out a careful position on how he would like to deal with Brexit in a strategy aimed at not alienating either leave or remain voters at an election. He would first want to win an election, then negotiate a Labour Brexit deal with Brussels relatively quickly. Within six months of the election, there would be a second referendum to choose between Labour’s deal and remaining in the EU. A special conference would decide how Labour should campaign.Corbyn has so far refused to say whether he would prefer a Labour-led Brexit deal or to remain in the EU, saying it depends what is negotiated with Brussels. It is not clear whether he could stay above the fray of campaigning in a referendum while the party picked a side. His aim would probably be to play the honest broker carrying out what the people decide. It puts him in a different place from senior Labour figures who want to personally campaign to remain, including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the deputy leader, Tom Watson, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary.Many remain campaigners are unhappy with Corbyn’s stance and wanted an unequivocal policy of campaigning to stay in the EU going into an election. MPs in marginal seats, including shadow cabinet ministers, are also concerned the Lib Dems, who have a policy of revoking article 50, could take a significant amount of votes off them at an election without a more pro-remain stance.Corbyn’s position won by a show of hands, with the chair not seeing the need for a vote to be counted precisely – known as a “card vote”. A succession of speakers from Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, to Momentum activists succeeded in turning the issue into one of loyalty to Corbyn’s leadership. But the row caused bitter splits among Labour groups and trade unions, with Unison and a big chunk of local parties having declared remain positions. While Corbyn did appear to have the backing of the room, remain campaigners said that could have been because of his support from the unions. “It is possible that the remain motion had a majority in the CLPs, but because there was no card vote we will never know,” said one.Corbyn’s position within the party has been once again bolstered, as it became clear he had the backing of the floor. However, it was a battle partly won because of a trade union bloc vote by Unite and the GMB in his favour and much of the membership are still hoping for a shift to a pro-remain position in future. There will still likely be a battle at the party’s clause V meeting ahead of an election to decide the manifesto position. However, Corbyn’s victory makes it much more likely that Labour will head to the polls without saying whether it would campaign to leave or remain in the event of a second referendum.The EU has always said it is ready to work with any British government to map out a future relationship, ranging from Norway-style membership of the single market to a Canada-style free trade agreement putting much greater distance between the bloc and the UK.What has been ruled out repeatedly are substantial changes to the divorce deal: the legally binding withdrawal agreement covering citizens’ rights, the Brexit bill and the Irish border. A revamped political declaration could be agreed within days, if the UK wanted it. However, it would only be a prelude to years of post-Brexit negotiations on trade, security and foreign policy.While the EU would welcome a closer trading relationship, which is less damaging for economies on both sides, it has ruled out granting the UK special status. The EU has repeatedly said non-membership can never be as good as membership. That guiding principle makes some ideas circulated by Labour MPs implausible, such as a British veto on EU trade deals, or a British opt-out from free movement of people, while having unrestricted free movement of goods, services and capital.",What does Labour vote signify about where it stands on Brexit?,2019-09-23/20:04:47,the labour leader has set out a careful position on how he would like to deal with brexit in a strategy aimed at not alienating either leave or remain voters at an election he would first want to win an election then negotiate a labour brexit deal with brussels relatively quickly within six months of the election there would be a second referendum to choose between labour s deal and remaining in the eu a special conference would decide how labour should campaign corbyn has so far refused to say whether he would prefer a labour led brexit deal or to remain in the eu saying it depends what is negotiated with brussels it is not clear whether he could stay above the fray of campaigning in a referendum while the party picked a side his aim would probably be to play the honest broker carrying out what the people decide it puts him in a different place from senior labour figures who want to personally campaign to remain including the shadow chancellor john mcdonnell the deputy leader tom watson and emily thornberry the shadow foreign secretary many remain campaigners are unhappy with corbyn s stance and wanted an unequivocal policy of campaigning to stay in the eu going into an election mps in marginal seats including shadow cabinet ministers are also concerned the lib dems who have a policy of revoking article  could take a significant amount of votes off them at an election without a more pro remain stance corbyn s position won by a show of hands with the chair not seeing the need for a vote to be counted precisely known as a card vote a succession of speakers from len mccluskey the unite general secretary to momentum activists succeeded in turning the issue into one of loyalty to corbyn s leadership but the row caused bitter splits among labour groups and trade unions with unison and a big chunk of local parties having declared remain positions while corbyn did appear to have the backing of the room remain campaigners said that could have been because of his support from the unions it is possible that the remain motion had a majority in the clps but because there was no card vote we will never know said one corbyn s position within the party has been once again bolstered as it became clear he had the backing of the floor however it was a battle partly won because of a trade union bloc vote by unite and the gmb in his favour and much of the membership are still hoping for a shift to a pro remain position in future there will still likely be a battle at the party s clause v meeting ahead of an election to decide the manifesto position however corbyn s victory makes it much more likely that labour will head to the polls without saying whether it would campaign to leave or remain in the event of a second referendum the eu has always said it is ready to work with any british government to map out a future relationship ranging from norway style membership of the single market to a canada style free trade agreement putting much greater distance between the bloc and the uk what has been ruled out repeatedly are substantial changes to the divorce deal the legally binding withdrawal agreement covering citizens rights the brexit bill and the irish border a revamped political declaration could be agreed within days if the uk wanted it however it would only be a prelude to years of post brexit negotiations on trade security and foreign policy while the eu would welcome a closer trading relationship which is less damaging for economies on both sides it has ruled out granting the uk special status the eu has repeatedly said non membership can never be as good as membership that guiding principle makes some ideas circulated by labour mps implausible such as a british veto on eu trade deals or a british opt out from free movement of people while having unrestricted free movement of goods services and capital ,Brexit,0.27548027
1272,"The question of why Wales voted to leave the EU can in large part be answered by the number of English retired people who have moved across the border, research has found.Despite being one of the biggest beneficiaries of EU funding, Wales voted leave by a majority of 52% to 48% in the 2016 referendum – a result that took some analysts by surprise. However, work by Danny Dorling, a professor of geography at Oxford, found that the  result could in part be attributed to the influence of English voters.“If you look at the more genuinely Welsh areas, especially the Welsh-speaking ones, they did not want to leave the EU,” Dorling told the Sunday Times. “Wales was made to look like a Brexit-supporting nation by its English settlers.”About 21% (650,000) of people living in Wales were born in England, with nearly a quarter aged over 65. The country voted for Brexit by a majority of just 82,000.Border towns and areas of central Wales with large English communities, such as Wrexham and Powys, recorded a higher proportion of leave votes, whereas Welsh-speaking areas such as Gwynedd and Ceredigion had high remain votes.Dorling’s research, which was presented at the British Science Association’s annual meeting at Warwick University, also suggested that most of the UK’s leave votes did come not from the north of England but the south, with the highest numbers in areas populated with affluent older people, such as Hampshire, Cornwall and Devon.“The Welsh did not want to quit the EU, but that is one of many false beliefs about Brexit. The biggest is that the pro-leave vote was due to northerners,” he said. “It’s true some northern areas were strongly pro-Brexit, but the population there is too small to swing the vote.“The real support for Brexit, in terms of numbers of votes, was in places like Cornwall, which was 57% for leave, Hampshire with 54%, Essex with 62% and Norfolk with 57%. It is those southern English voters that are dragging Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland unwillingly out of Europe.“Everyone blames Wigan and Stoke for Brexit but we should really be blaming Cornwall and Devon.”","English people living in Wales tilted it towards Brexit, research finds",2019-09-22/15:59:34,the question of why wales voted to leave the eu can in large part be answered by the number of english retired people who have moved across the border research has found despite being one of the biggest beneficiaries of eu funding wales voted leave by a majority of  to  in the  referendum a result that took some analysts by surprise however work by danny dorling a professor of geography at oxford found that the result could in part be attributed to the influence of english voters if you look at the more genuinely welsh areas especially the welsh speaking ones they did not want to leave the eu dorling told the sunday times wales was made to look like a brexit supporting nation by its english settlers about    of people living in wales were born in england with nearly a quarter aged over  the country voted for brexit by a majority of just   border towns and areas of central wales with large english communities such as wrexham and powys recorded a higher proportion of leave votes whereas welsh speaking areas such as gwynedd and ceredigion had high remain votes dorling s research which was presented at the british science association s annual meeting at warwick university also suggested that most of the uk s leave votes did come not from the north of england but the south with the highest numbers in areas populated with affluent older people such as hampshire cornwall and devon the welsh did not want to quit the eu but that is one of many false beliefs about brexit the biggest is that the pro leave vote was due to northerners he said it s true some northern areas were strongly pro brexit but the population there is too small to swing the vote the real support for brexit in terms of numbers of votes was in places like cornwall which was  for leave hampshire with  essex with  and norfolk with  it is those southern english voters that are dragging scotland wales and northern ireland unwillingly out of europe everyone blames wigan and stoke for brexit but we should really be blaming cornwall and devon ,Brexit,0.200531185
1682,"The chances of the UK staying in the EU are as high as 30% as the country would be likely to reject Brexit in a second referendum, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, has said.The bloc’s most senior official claimed the British public had only truly debated Brexit after the 2016 referendum and there was significant reason to believe the leave vote could be reversed.Describing the decision by the former British prime minister, David Cameron, to call the vote as a political miscalculation, Tusk said he would expect a different result in a vote today given what had been learned about the consequences of leaving.“The referendum was at the worst possible moment, it is the result of a wrong political calculation,” Tusk said in an interview with the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza (GW) that was shared with the Guardian as part of the Europa collaboration of six European newspapers.“A real debate about the consequences of Brexit wasn’t had during the referendum campaign, but only after the vote. Today the result would probably look different. Paradoxically, Brexit awoke in Great Britain a pro-European movement.”Tusk, whose tenure as president of the European council, the EU body made up of the 28 leaders of member states, is due to end in November, said he had been moved by the anti-Brexit march in London earlier this year during which he was celebrated as a voice calling for the UK to reconsider.While suggesting there was a “crisis in leadership” among remainers, in an echo of his previous claim that the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn is essentially pro-Brexit, Tusk said he still believed it was possible the question could again be put to the people.The Labour leader this week suggested a second referendum could be a “healing” development, as cross-party talks over the Brexit impasse in Westminster appeared to be fizzling out.“Hannah Arendt said that in politics and history things only become irreversible when people recognise them as such. Because, in themselves, they are not irreversible,” Tusk said.“After the British referendum in 2016, I thought that if we recognise that the case is closed, it will be the end. Today the chance that Brexit will not happen is, in my opinion, 20-30%. That’s a lot.“From month to month, it is becoming increasingly clear that the UK’s exit from the EU will look completely different than the Brexit that was promoted,” Tusk added. “I see no reason to capitulate.”The former Polish prime minister, who was interviewed by the GW editor, Adam Michnik, to mark the newspaper’s 30th anniversary, said there was historical precedent for the British people revisiting decisions made in referendums.“Even if we repeat that the referendum is the expression of will by the nation, and the will of the nation must be respected, yes, you have to respect it,” he said. “But the 2016 referendum was not the first on the UK‘s membership of the EU. The first took place in 1975, when the British, two years after entering the European Economic Commmunity, decided whether to remain in it.“If the 2016 referendum was able to change the result of the referendum in 1975, why can it not be changed again? Nothing is irreversible until people believe it is.”In April, Britain’s membership of the EU was extended to 31 October by the 27 heads of state and government to allow Downing Street more time to secure ratification of the withdrawal agreement.The UK had been due to leave the bloc on 29 March, after two years of negotiations, but the repeated rejection of Theresa May’s Brexit deal by the Commons forced the prime minister to seek more time.Tusk admitted that “almost every day” he heard from those who said the UK should be cut off from the EU if it was unable to come to a deal.“My main task is to make sure that the EU has shown patience despite being felt in many places on the continent these negative emotions,” he said. “I say to colleagues to wait a while longer. For now, we managed to win some time. The deadline expires in October, but I will persuade them – if necessary – not to close the calendar. There is no place for rush to Brexit. Churchill used to say that a problem postponed is partially solved.”",Donald Tusk: chance of Brexit being cancelled could be 30%,2019-05-10/11:00:29,the chances of the uk staying in the eu are as high as  as the country would be likely to reject brexit in a second referendum the president of the european council donald tusk has said the bloc s most senior official claimed the british public had only truly debated brexit after the  referendum and there was significant reason to believe the leave vote could be reversed describing the decision by the former british prime minister david cameron to call the vote as a political miscalculation tusk said he would expect a different result in a vote today given what had been learned about the consequences of leaving the referendum was at the worst possible moment it is the result of a wrong political calculation tusk said in an interview with the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza gw that was shared with the guardian as part of the europa collaboration of six european newspapers a real debate about the consequences of brexit wasn t had during the referendum campaign but only after the vote today the result would probably look different paradoxically brexit awoke in great britain a pro european movement tusk whose tenure as president of the european council the eu body made up of the  leaders of member states is due to end in november said he had been moved by the anti brexit march in london earlier this year during which he was celebrated as a voice calling for the uk to reconsider while suggesting there was a crisis in leadership among remainers in an echo of his previous claim that the labour party under jeremy corbyn is essentially pro brexit tusk said he still believed it was possible the question could again be put to the people the labour leader this week suggested a second referendum could be a healing development as cross party talks over the brexit impasse in westminster appeared to be fizzling out hannah arendt said that in politics and history things only become irreversible when people recognise them as such because in themselves they are not irreversible tusk said after the british referendum in  i thought that if we recognise that the case is closed it will be the end today the chance that brexit will not happen is in my opinion   that s a lot from month to month it is becoming increasingly clear that the uk s exit from the eu will look completely different than the brexit that was promoted tusk added i see no reason to capitulate the former polish prime minister who was interviewed by the gw editor adam michnik to mark the newspaper s th anniversary said there was historical precedent for the british people revisiting decisions made in referendums even if we repeat that the referendum is the expression of will by the nation and the will of the nation must be respected yes you have to respect it he said but the  referendum was not the first on the uk s membership of the eu the first took place in  when the british two years after entering the european economic commmunity decided whether to remain in it if the  referendum was able to change the result of the referendum in  why can it not be changed again nothing is irreversible until people believe it is in april britain s membership of the eu was extended to  october by the  heads of state and government to allow downing street more time to secure ratification of the withdrawal agreement the uk had been due to leave the bloc on  march after two years of negotiations but the repeated rejection of theresa may s brexit deal by the commons forced the prime minister to seek more time tusk admitted that almost every day he heard from those who said the uk should be cut off from the eu if it was unable to come to a deal my main task is to make sure that the eu has shown patience despite being felt in many places on the continent these negative emotions he said i say to colleagues to wait a while longer for now we managed to win some time the deadline expires in october but i will persuade them if necessary not to close the calendar there is no place for rush to brexit churchill used to say that a problem postponed is partially solved ,Brexit,0.317966402
1977,"The government has given British Steel an emergency £120m loan to cover an EU bill for carbon dioxide emissions, after the delay in reaching a Brexit withdrawal deal forced it to intervene.The business secretary, Greg Clark, told parliament that British Steel would have faced a bill of more than £600m from EU regulators if the government had not given it the support.British Steel has been unable to obtain its free carbon emissions credits for this year under the EU’s Emissions Trading System, after the European Commission suspended the UK from the scheme in December in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit.While the UK’s membership of the EU has been extended until October, parliament’s inability to vote through a withdrawal agreement has meant that British companies, including British Steel, are still locked out of the system.British Steel faced a fine of £500m from the European commission, on top of the £120m cost of buying the allowances, which polluting industries must have if they continue to emit greenhouse gases.The company, which has an annual turnover of £1.4bn, approached the government earlier this year, saying it was unable to pay for enough allowances before the deadline of midnight on Tuesday. Clark said a liability of that size would have put the company under “significant financial strain”.The government expects to recoup all of the money loaned to British Steel plus interest by taking over British Steel’s allowances and selling them on. British Steel has committed to cover the difference if the price of allowances falls by the time it eventually receives them.The scramble to pay the carbon bill underlines the struggles faced by the UK steel industry in recent years. British Steel, which currently employs 4,200 people directly in the UK, in Scunthorpe, Skinningrove and Redcar, was bought for £1 from India’s Tata Steel by investment firm Greybull Capital in June 2016. However, in September it cut the jobs of a tenth of its employees, blaming a weak pound.Anna Turley, the Labour MP for Redcar, welcomed the announcement, but tweeted that the announcement showed that the government could have intervened when the company was struggling in 2015.Steve Turner, assistant general secretary for manufacturing at Unite, the union, said the company’s workers “will be breathing a sigh of relief”. However, he warned that the relief “could be short lived” without wider support for the steel industry.The union has argued that the government should mandate the use of British steel in UK warships, as well as giving support on energy costs.",British Steel receives £120m government loan,2019-05-01/17:14:22,the government has given british steel an emergency m loan to cover an eu bill for carbon dioxide emissions after the delay in reaching a brexit withdrawal deal forced it to intervene the business secretary greg clark told parliament that british steel would have faced a bill of more than m from eu regulators if the government had not given it the support british steel has been unable to obtain its free carbon emissions credits for this year under the eu s emissions trading system after the european commission suspended the uk from the scheme in december in preparation for a possible no deal brexit while the uk s membership of the eu has been extended until october parliament s inability to vote through a withdrawal agreement has meant that british companies including british steel are still locked out of the system british steel faced a fine of m from the european commission on top of the m cost of buying the allowances which polluting industries must have if they continue to emit greenhouse gases the company which has an annual turnover of  bn approached the government earlier this year saying it was unable to pay for enough allowances before the deadline of midnight on tuesday clark said a liability of that size would have put the company under significant financial strain the government expects to recoup all of the money loaned to british steel plus interest by taking over british steel s allowances and selling them on british steel has committed to cover the difference if the price of allowances falls by the time it eventually receives them the scramble to pay the carbon bill underlines the struggles faced by the uk steel industry in recent years british steel which currently employs   people directly in the uk in scunthorpe skinningrove and redcar was bought for  from india s tata steel by investment firm greybull capital in june  however in september it cut the jobs of a tenth of its employees blaming a weak pound anna turley the labour mp for redcar welcomed the announcement but tweeted that the announcement showed that the government could have intervened when the company was struggling in  steve turner assistant general secretary for manufacturing at unite the union said the company s workers will be breathing a sigh of relief however he warned that the relief could be short lived without wider support for the steel industry the union has argued that the government should mandate the use of british steel in uk warships as well as giving support on energy costs ,Brexit,0.186089709
2055,"Welcome back to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing: trying to make sense of the nonsensical since June 2016. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means podcast here.Well. It’s all – somewhat, I suspect, to everyone’s relief – gone terribly quiet. Almost as if the accumulated exhaustion, a welcome Easter break and that lengthy article 50 extension until 31 October have combined to take the wind out of Brexit’s sails.It would be a mistake, though, to think it’s gone away. It really hasn’t. So Brexit talks between government ministers and Labour to find a compromise able to win MPs’ backing resumed last week, but expectations of a breakthrough were minimal.Rumours that Theresa May – who still hopes a deal will be ratified in time to avoid the UK taking part in EU elections next month – would table a vote on the key legislation enacting Britain’s exit from the EU as early as next week proved unfounded.Labour complained the government would not contemplate substantive changes to the deal’s political declaration (on Britain’s future relationship with the EU), instead proposing greater assurances on environmental standards and workers’ rights in a redrafted withdrawal act implementation bill.And amid a growing sense of political paralysis in Westminster, the prime minister suffered a further blow to her authority as backbench Tory MPs, while stopping short of changing the party’s rules to allow her to be ousted within weeks, demanded a “roadmap” for her departure whether her deal passes or not.Away from the Conservatives, the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage – whose new Brexit party leads the polling for the European elections – said he aimed to build on the momentum of the 26 May vote to get rid of what he termed a “remain parliament”.Meanwhile, Labour faced a Brexit crisis of its own after a campaign leaflet in the south-west of England sparked fury among the party’s remainer beckbenchers and members by failing to mention a second referendum, which they say is now official party policy.Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would decide this week what to put in its election manifesto, while the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, reckoned it could sign up to a Brexit deal without a second vote if the talks made progress soon.The Labour MPs behind parliament’s push for a confirmatory referendum wrote to their party’s governing body demanding it use the elections to campaign for a fresh poll regardless of whether a deal has been reached with the government.It’s anyone’s guess. May survived the backbench attempt to call a second no confidence vote, but few believe she can dodge having to fight the EU elections – with the prospect of going up against Farage’s Brexit party infuriating Tory MPs.There is acknowledgement the government must, however, attempt something new before the elections, and if the cross-party talks fail to advance it may try to devise a way to forge a compromise through a small number of new indicative votes.May could be challenged, including by cabinet ministers, if she agrees to a closer customs arrangement as a way of getting Labour to back her deal. And if, as expected, the Tories are humiliated in local elections and then overwhelmed by the Brexit party in the European vote, she could yet decide to go of her own accord.Brexit has trapped UK in no man’s land, warns top economistBrexit will slow UK economy for rest of 2019, forecaster warnsTories should expect to lose 800 seats in local elections, says analystEU students could face higher fees to study in UK from 2020Kezia Dugdale to leave politics over Labour’s Brexit stancePublic thinks EU referendum was bad idea, says pollUK parties unveil eye-catching European election candidatesLib Dems launch EU election campaign with “Stop Brexit” messageP&O sues over £33m Eurotunnel payout in Brexit ferry fiascoIrish backstop could undermine EU standards, German report saysSecretive hard-Brexit Facebook campaign got 1m responsesUK’s biggest fishing trawler sails up Thames in Brexit warningThe Guardian’s editorial on the state of the Conservative party pulled no punches, saying it was being destroyed by Brexit:Many ministers seem to have returned to Westminster this week blinded by the ambition to succeed Theresa May. Much of the Tory party returned with only one idea – a leadership challenge which would solve nothing whatsoever about Brexit and could easily trigger a general election in which the Tories could be massacred. It is said that those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad. This seems to be true of the modern Conservative party. Driven crazy by the failure of Brexit and obsessed with the stupid fantasy that a more doctrinaire leader than Mrs May would be more successful than she is, much of the party today displays all the dignity and judgment of a headless chicken. The Tory party used to pride itself on being the natural party of government. Today it is proving itself unfit for government at all.Matthew d’Ancona reckoned Nigel Farage was – as he had long predicted – being fuelled by the myth of Brexit betrayal, enabling a new movement to rise up amid the anger:The political class has strained every tendon to find a way of delivering the undeliverable: extracting the UK from a 46-year relationship without wrecking its prosperity, security and access to the wider world. Brexit has failed because that square-circling task is impossible. But Farage appeals to a primal social instinct: that the few are, yet again, cheating the many of their dream. It is not the dream that is at fault, you understand, but those who sabotage it. Just as Marxists insist true communism has never been tried, so Brexiteers declare that their simple plan has been wrecked by weaklings, quislings and fools. Brexit was designed by its most passionate supporters to fail: its purpose was to be betrayed, to enable a new movement to rise up, animated by fury and fear. Such a movement has now been born. It is already tearing the Conservative party to pieces. That, sad to say, is only the beginning of its plan.A somewhat despairing plea from one of the Tory party’s most committed Brexiters:Please don't let Brexit put you off voting Conservative in the

2473,"The possibility of the UK leaving the European Union blared like an air-raid siren in Government Buildings, the quadrangle of Portland stone and Wicklow granite in central Dublin that houses the taoiseach’s office. Officials summoned politicians, diplomats, business leaders, farming groups, academics and others to the complex off Upper Merrion Street. The guests climbed a beechwood staircase with a stained glass window, My Four Green Fields, representing Ireland’s four provinces.At the improvised summit all agreed that Britain’s exit from the EU would present an unprecedented threat to Irish interests. They agreed to meet monthly to brainstorm – discussions which led to a task force, a strategy, a plan.This was 2015. Few people had even heard of the word Brexit. It was a year before David Cameron called the referendum, two years before Theresa May declared “red lines” over the UK’s withdrawal. It was three years before she agreed to the Irish border backstop as an option and signed the withdrawal agreement that triggered a breakdown in Westminster.The roots of the UK’s political and constitutional crisis spread far and wide: decades of anti-EU propaganda, a Tory party civil war, a reckless Cameron gamble, a dogged, blinkered successor, a divided Labour party. And with a starring role, the backstop.A term once confined to rounders and baseball, it refers to an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the event of the UK’s no-deal departure. The Irish government persuaded the EU to make the backstop a condition of the UK’s withdrawal.Supporters, including Tony Blair and John Major, say it is needed to protect the 1998 Good Friday agreement which drew a line under the Troubles and ended a three-decade conflict that claimed more than 3,600 lives. They say the return of border controls and infrastructure could wreck the peace process.Brexiters call the backstop a trap which could chain the UK to Brussels in a de facto customs union and undermine the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Both sides agree that Dublin outplayed its former colonial master. While London dithered in the referendum aftermath, the Irish nimbly forged an alliance of all 27 member states.“I pay tribute to the Irish government and Ireland the way that ... you know ... people in Dublin really saw the issues a long way out, much more clearly, perhaps than people in London did,” a rueful Boris Johnson, the former British foreign secretary, admitted in January during a visit to Dublin.The story of the backstop is not of a flawlessly executed Celtic masterplan, however. Dublin conceived it fitfully and gradually in response to British contradictions and missteps. But once crystallised as a goal, the Irish pursued it hell for leather.“It was very clearly identified at the very early stages that Northern Ireland and the border would become an issue,” Helen McEntee, Ireland’s minister of state for European affairs, said in an interview this week.“The border came up at every meeting,” said Andrew Gilmore, deputy research director at the Institute of International and European Affairs thinktank, who attended stakeholder consultations.While the UK suffered from what some call “Brexit comprehension lag” the Irish were quick off the blocks.Enda Kenny, the then taoiseach, ordered the first Brexit impact study in 2014. Officials identified the impact on the economy, diplomatic ties, and crucially the Good Friday agreement and what Brexit would mean for the border. A further 85-page report was produced in November 2015 outlining consequences of a yes and a no vote.2014: The first Brexit impact report identifies the border as an issue for the Good Friday agreement and single market. This leads to a second report in 2015 detailing options for Ireland if the UK votes to leave the EU.24 June 2016: The day after the EU referendum, Dublin activates contingency plans to create a Brexit taskforce and ramps up diplomatic missions across the bloc.17 January 2017: Theresa May’s Lancaster House declaration of 'red lines' convinces Dublin of the need for a border insurance policy.29 April 2017: Dublin persuades the European commission to make the border a priority in guidelines for the first phase of the negotiations. It confirms the EU’s 'Ireland-first' policy.4 December 2017: May is poised to sign up to 'regulatory alignment' between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, which would avert a hard border. But the Democratic Unionist party intervenes, saying it would weaken Northern Ireland’s place in the UK. May extends the backstop to the whole of the UK, angering Brexiters.It went into detail that barely troubled the leave campaign, including options for membership of the EEA, a customs union, bilateral trade agreements and the doomsday option of a no-deal exit, in which the UK and EU would default to World Trade Organization rules.After the shock of the no vote sunk in, Kenny quickly assembled a team of almost 100 people to work on Brexit. He beefed up embassies across EU capitals to convey a stark message: the border was not just about protecting the single market, it was about peace.Irish policymakers knew referendums could turn into opportunities for voters to kick the political establishment – it happened in Ireland numerous times. To neutralise the danger Kenny lobbied the EU to grant Cameron meaningful concessions in talks in early 2016 to help him win the referendum. He also warned Cameron to be extremely careful.All in vain. The EU concessions to Cameron were meagre and he bungled the campaign.“It’s often difficult to get information out to people, to make it clear what it is that you’re asking of them. So there was always a concern that it might not be as straightforward as people thought,” said McEntee, speaking from an office adorned with Irish and EU flags.Despite their forebodings, the referendum result shocked Irish officials. They had hoped to shelve the contingency plans. Instead they scrambled to develop them.“Those documents started as a basis and have evolved and grown legs and wings and developed into what we have now in terms of our strategy,” said McEntee.The Irish initially hoped bilateral talks could find a way to keep the border frictionless. The Good Friday agreement had fostered close ties with London. British officials often admired Government Buildings, an Edwardian gem designed by Sir Aston Webb, who also designed Buckingham Palace.But investigation of technical solutions, such as cameras or trusted traders, proved fruitless. In October 2016 Theresa May, who had replaced Cameron as prime minister, told the Tory party conference the UK would leave the single market, the first of her red lines.As she was speaking to appease the right wing of the party and neuter Ukip support in the country, the Irish government was growing increasingly worried about the border.In October Kenny agreed with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, that technical talks between officials in Brussels and Dublin would open. They met again in January 2017 and agreed “there was no technical solution” to the border.They were beginning to realise that only a political solution – specifically, regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU – could avert a hard border. This was the genesis of the backstop.That conviction grew when May gave her Lancaster House speech later in January, hardening her red lines, promising the UK would leave the customs union and the single market. Brexit did not mean Brexit; it meant hard Brexit.In Brussels and Dublin it was decided that the UK now “had to own” the border issue.All they had extracted out of Britain so far was a line in May’s speech that there would be “no return to the borders of the past”.“That was no good to us,” said one source. “That referenced watchtowers and guns, but this is not what the border issue was about, we were never going back there. This was about the customs union and the single market.”The turning point came a few months later in a keynote speech by Kenny, who for the first time indicated the bilateral approach was dead and avoiding a post-Brexit “hard border” was now vital for the republic’s national interest.It was a shift in Ireland’s position, born out of the investigations into the border technical issues conducted with the commission over the previous five months.The Irish goal was to get the border into a legally binding withdrawal agreement – Dublin’s point of maximum leverage – rather than future trade relations, when Dublin would struggle to be heard.Rumours that Ireland was angling for a legally binding solution spooked the then Brexit secretary, David Davis. A scheduled meeting with Ireland’s deputy prime minister was mysteriously cancelled. “When they heard what was potentially to be discussed, he suddenly wasn’t available,” said a source. “The relationship with David Davis was not good.”The Irish discounted Downing Street promises to keep the border as frictionless as possible, viewing the British as “slippery”, saying the right things but not necessarily delivering, said a source close to the talks. “They had decades of experience of negotiations with the British over Northern Ireland and knew what they would be like.”Ireland was a midget with a big advantage: British ineptitude. Downing Street failed to plan for Brexit before the referendum and never caught up. Conservative party divisions split the cabinet and sabotaged attempts to clarify goals and strategy.May compounded her difficulties by calling an election in June 2017 that lost her parliamentary majority and made her dependent on the Democratic Unionist party (DUP). The DUP opposed any special status for Northern Ireland lest it weaken the union. The prime minister tried to appease the DUP by widening the backstop to encompass the UK, not just Northern Ireland, but this angered Brexiters.Downing Street’s road to perdition began with three incompatible commitments: leaving the single market and customs union, the UK jumping together, and no hard border in Ireland. Logic said you could have two, not three.Brexiters squared this by saying any backstop would be a “convenient fiction” and not really legally binding. “Cakeism” – wanting to have your cake and eat it – entered the political lexicon. Ivan Rogers, the UK’s ambassador to Brussels, resigned in despair at “fantasies and delusions”.After Leo Varadkar succeeded Kenny in June 2017 the Irish pressed their advantage. The new taoiseach wanted a “win”, said one Fine Gael party colleague, and squeezing the Brits proved popular. A government colleague said Varadkar, a policy wonk with a direct style, was simply pursuing the national interest. “He’s Mr Spock. He looks at what’s logical and tries to operate on that basis.”Unlike May, besieged on all fronts, Varadkar enjoyed support from opposition parties and media commentators, who treated Brexit as a national emergency.The taoiseach relied on seasoned diplomats – Rory Montgomery, Declan Kelleher, John Callinan – and a tightknit cabinet team. McEntee operated from his office. Simon Coveney, his deputy and foreign minister, operated from Iveagh House, a 10-minute walk across St Stephen’s Green. Phil Hogan, Ireland’s EU commissioner, provided intelligence from Brussels.Britain assumed EU players would override Ireland. Surely German car makers and French farmers would not let fussing about a drizzly border between Derry and Dundalk imperil an orderly UK exit? But Berlin and Paris rebuffed Downing Street.Solidarity belonged to the member staying in the club, not the one leaving. Some had a personal stake in the backstop. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, used to be a commissioner who ran peace programmes in Northern Ireland. Baltic states with an eye on Russia appreciated the bloc supporting a minnow against a heavyweight.Some EU members needed wooing. “There was a feeling that people in Europe had forgotten about Northern Ireland … we needed to re-educate them,” said a source.Varadkar cited an Irish Times article about a 1972 IRA attack on a customs post. Ministers racked up air miles courting support and invited counterparts to visit the border.The Irish government had a semi-permanent base camp at the Carrickdale hotel near the old border customs post at Jonesborough on the road between Dublin and Belfast. It hosted a revolving cast of officials, foreign affairs ministers and premiers including Xavier Bettel, Michel Barnier, and Donald Tusk.It was vital to show that the border was an invisible line across fields and communities, said McEntee. “People see that and they understand how complex it is.” When former police officers brief them about the Troubles “it becomes much more real”, she said.And so unfolded a historic reversal.After the Anglo-Irish war in 1921 Dublin’s envoys bowed to British pressure and agreed to partition, creating a 310-mile border. Ireland’s ensuing civil war claimed the life of its chief negotiator, Michael Collins, but David Lloyd George claimed to have solved the Irish question.Almost a century later, another British premier is tangled in a deal involving that same border. It has sundered her party and parliament. Her pleas to reopen the agreement have failed.It is a great feat for Irish diplomacy. But Dublin is not celebrating. Unless the UK ratifies the withdrawal deal or cancels Brexit it may yet crash out of the EU with no deal, wreaking havoc on both sides of the Irish border and rendering the backstop a hollow victory. The Irish pay history some heed. They do not claim to have solved the British question.• Tomorrow: Daniel Boffey on how Brussels outmanoeuvred the UK• The caption to the picture of Leo Varadkar and Michel Barnier was amended on 18 April 2019 because an earlier version said Varadkhar was on the left.

plan this was  few people had even heard of the word brexit it was a year before david cameron called the referendum two years before theresa may declared red lines over the uk s withdrawal it was three years before she agreed to the irish border backstop as an option and signed the withdrawal agreement that triggered a breakdown in westminster the roots of the uk s political and constitutional crisis spread far and wide decades of anti eu propaganda a tory party civil war a reckless cameron gamble a dogged blinkered successor a divided labour party and with a starring role the backstop a term once confined to rounders and baseball it refers to an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland in the event of the uk s no deal departure the irish government persuaded the eu to make the backstop a condition of the uk s withdrawal supporters including tony blair and john major say it is needed to protect the  good friday agreement which drew a line under the troubles and ended a three decade conflict that claimed more than   lives they say the return of border controls and infrastructure could wreck the peace process brexiters call the backstop a trap which could chain the uk to brussels in a de facto customs union and undermine the union between great britain and northern ireland both sides agree that dublin outplayed its former colonial master while london dithered in the referendum aftermath the irish nimbly forged an alliance of all  member states i pay tribute to the irish government and ireland the way that you know people in dublin really saw the issues a long way out much more clearly perhaps than people in london did a rueful boris johnson the former british foreign secretary admitted in january during a visit to dublin the story of the backstop is not of a flawlessly executed celtic masterplan however dublin conceived it fitfully and gradually in response to british contradictions and missteps but once crystallised as a goal the irish pursued it hell for leather it was very clearly identified at the very early stages that northern ireland and the border would become an issue helen mcentee ireland s minister of state for european affairs said in an interview this week the border came up at every meeting said andrew gilmore deputy research director at the institute of international and european affairs thinktank who attended stakeholder consultations while the uk suffered from what some call brexit comprehension lag the irish were quick off the blocks enda kenny the then taoiseach ordered the first brexit impact study in  officials identified the impact on the economy diplomatic ties and crucially the good friday agreement and what brexit would mean for the border a further  page report was produced in november  outlining consequences of a yes and a no vote  the first brexit impact report identifies the border as an issue for the good friday agreement and single market this leads to a second report in  detailing options for ireland if the uk votes to leave the eu  june  the day after the eu referendum dublin activates contingency plans to create a brexit taskforce and ramps up diplomatic missions across the bloc  january  theresa may s lancaster house declaration of red lines convinces dublin of the need for a border insurance policy  april  dublin persuades the european commission to make the border a priority in guidelines for the first phase of the negotiations it confirms the eu s ireland first policy  december  may is poised to sign up to regulatory alignment between northern ireland and the irish republic which would avert a hard border but the democratic unionist party intervenes saying it would weaken northern ireland s place in the uk may extends the backstop to the whole of the uk angering brexiters it went into detail that barely troubled the leave campaign including options for membership of the eea a customs union bilateral trade agreements and the doomsday option of a no deal exit in which the uk and eu would default to world trade organization rules after the shock of the no vote sunk in kenny quickly assembled a team of almost  people to work on brexit he beefed up embassies across eu capitals to convey a stark message the border was not just about protecting the single market it was about peace irish policymakers knew referendums could turn into opportunities for voters to kick the political establishment it happened in ireland numerous times to neutralise the danger kenny lobbied the eu to grant cameron meaningful concessions in talks in early  to help him win the referendum he also warned cameron to be extremely careful all in vain the eu concessions to cameron were meagre and he bungled the campaign it s often difficult to get information out to people to make it clear what it is that you re asking of them so there was always a concern that it might not be as straightforward as people thought said mcentee speaking from an office adorned with irish and eu flags despite their forebodings the referendum result shocked irish officials they had hoped to shelve the contingency plans instead they scrambled to develop them those documents started as a basis and have evolved and grown legs and wings and developed into what we have now in terms of our strategy said mcentee the irish initially hoped bilateral talks could find a way to keep the border frictionless the good friday agreement had fostered close ties with london british officials often admired government buildings an edwardian gem designed by sir aston webb who also designed buckingham palace but investigation of technical solutions such as cameras or trusted traders proved fruitless in october  theresa may who had replaced cameron as prime minister told the tory party conference the uk would leave the single market the first of her red lines as she was speaking to appease the right wing of the party and neuter ukip support in the country the irish government was growing increasingly worried about the border in october kenny agreed with the european commission president jean claude juncker that technical talks between officials in brussels and dublin would open they met again in january  and agreed there was no technical solution to the border they were beginning to realise that only a political solution specifically regulatory alignment between northern ireland and the eu could avert a hard border this was the genesis of the backstop that conviction grew when may gave her lancaster house speech later in january hardening her red lines promising the uk would leave the customs union and the single market brexit did not mean brexit it meant hard brexit in brussels and dublin it was decided that the uk now had to own the border issue all they had extracted out of britain so far was a line in may s speech that there would be no return to the borders of the past that was no good to us said one source that referenced watchtowers and guns but this is not what the border issue was about we were never going back there this was about the customs union and the single market the turning point came a few months later in a keynote speech by kenny who for the first time indicated the bilateral approach was dead and avoiding a post brexit hard border was now vital for the republic s national interest it was a shift in ireland s position born out of the investigations into the border technical issues conducted with the commission over the previous five months the irish goal was to get the border into a legally binding withdrawal agreement dublin s point of maximum leverage rather than future trade relations when dublin would struggle to be heard rumours that ireland was angling for a legally binding solution spooked the then brexit secretary david davis a scheduled meeting with ireland s deputy prime minister was mysteriously cancelled when they heard what was potentially to be discussed he suddenly wasn t available said a source the relationship with david davis was not good the irish discounted downing street promises to keep the border as frictionless as possible viewing the british as slippery saying the right things but not necessarily delivering said a source close to the talks they had decades of experience of negotiations with the british over northern ireland and knew what they would be like ireland was a midget with a big advantage british ineptitude downing street failed to plan for brexit before the referendum and never caught up conservative party divisions split the cabinet and sabotaged attempts to clarify goals and strategy may compounded her difficulties by calling an election in june  that lost her parliamentary majority and made her dependent on the democratic unionist party dup the dup opposed any special status for northern ireland lest it weaken the union the prime minister tried to appease the dup by widening the backstop to encompass the uk not just northern ireland but this angered brexiters downing street s road to perdition began with three incompatible commitments leaving the single market and customs union the uk jumping together and no hard border in ireland logic said you could have two not three brexiters squared this by saying any backstop would be a convenient fiction and not really legally binding cakeism wanting to have your cake and eat it entered the political lexicon ivan rogers the uk s ambassador to brussels resigned in despair at fantasies and delusions after leo varadkar

2552,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, trying to make sense of the nonsensical since June 2016. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And catch our monthly Brexit Means podcast here.After all that excitement, the briefing is taking a break and will be back on 30 April.And: breathe. Two days before Britain could have been forced to leave the EU without a deal, the EU27 agreed that it could remain a member until 31 October, with the option to leave earlier if Theresa May can secure Commons support for her deal.After six hours, leaders endorsed a “flextension” with a Halloween cliff-edge to keep pressure on the Commons and a June summit that will review the UK’s behaviour as a member state, after France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, expressed concerns about Britain’s capacity to undermine the European project.Back in London, May sent exhausted MPs home for a 10-day Easter break, urging them to “reflect on the decisions that will have to be made swiftly on our return”. She stressed she would pursue cross-party talks aimed at finding a Brexit consensus and shrugged off calls for her resignation from backbenchers angry at its delay.The extension means Britain will have to hold European parliamentary elections unless MPs ratify the thrice-rejected withdrawal agreement by 22 May. This has angered some Tory MPs, who threatened to boycott the election campaign and expressed fears for party activists’ safety.As the government continued some no-deal planning but stood down 6,000 civil servants engaged in it, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, insisted the delay had not increased the prospect of a second referendum and said he still expected Britain to leave the EU.David Lidington, the prime minister’s de facto deputy, said the government and Labour must reach a compromise around a customs union if a deal was to be reached, while sources close to the talks said they would not advance much further unless May softened her red lines.As a new opinion poll showed Tory support plummeting to a five-year low, a former Conservative cabinet minister, Stephen Dorrell, defected to the independent Change UK group, and ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith urged May to step down before the EU elections. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said any Tory leadership contest must wait until a Brexit deal had been agreed.Meanwhile former Ukip leader Nigel Farage launched his new Brexit party to great fanfare, promising it would not be taking money from Arron Banks but would be fielding as the first of its European election candidates Annunziata Rees-Mogg, the sister of hardline Brexiter Jacob.Several scenarios remain open for May. Labour and the Conservatives could reach cross-party agreement likely to achieve a Commons majority, although it is unclear whether leave-supporting cabinet ministers would accept the necessary compromises.If no agreement is reached, May has said she hopes to persuade the opposition to sign up to a process of parliamentary votes – but there, too, it is unclear whether a majority would emerge for any particular option.The PM continues to believe her deal is the best way forward and could yet bring it back to the Commons, perhaps as one option among a series of indicative votes. With the Conservatives polling poorly, however, an election is seen as unlikely, and May will be unwilling to opt for a second referendum or to resign.My colleague Jessica Elgot put together an exceptionally useful timeline of the key dates between now and the end of the Brexit extension on 31 October, and here is a guide to what the EU27 offer means for politics, business, citizens and the EU.UK businesses at most gloomy since referendum, says DeloitteDangerous products could swamp UK after Brexit, warns Which? magazinePeople’s Vote campaigners vow to overhaul ‘project fear’ imageDavid Lammy says comparing ERG to Nazis ‘not strong enough’Judge orders Ukip to reveal EU referendum data useTiming of May’s ‘festival of Britain’ risks Irish angerPro-EU parties to use European elections as ‘soft referendum’IMF says Brexit delay means businesses face more uncertaintyDavid Cameron memoir still set for autumn, despite Brexit extensionMore than 400,000 EU nationals apply to stay in UK after BrexitIn the Guardian, former European commissioner and World Trade Organization boss Pascal Lamy says staying in a customs union after Brexit won’t resolve everything:Clearly, staying in a customs union would not be enough to solve the Irish border question. To take just one commonly cited example: if the UK remains in the customs union but imports chlorinated poultry from the US, there has to be a border, because the EU does not accept chlorinated poultry. This is a rule of the single market. Being in a customs union might be better than not being in a customs union, but it would come with very real downsides too. It is important that these are also considered. The UK now has limited time to make a more informed judgement about what happens next. Whatever it decides, it should do so with its eyes wide open. Otherwise, we could all soon find ourselves back on the cliff edge.And Aditya Chakrabortty argues that, while the Tories once had a radical fringe, Brexit means it now encompasses the whole party:The Conservative party is becoming the natural party of extremists. It is the new home for hardliners, catastrophists and those wishing to take up permanent residence in la-la land … It is the home of the radical right. That defines the Brexit project; it is also the dying embers of Thatcherism. And so a long and honourable tradition in British politics dies in front of us, in plain sight. Look at the men and women vying to replace May and they look little different from the Tories you used to know. Their suits are as traditionally roomy, the haircuts just as artless and the complexion as reliably white. But the party they wish to head is now a haven for conspiracy theorists, cranks and career cowards.Political scientist Matthew Goodwin lays out the damage the ongoing Brexit omnishambles is doing to

2645,"It was meant to be a glimmer of positivity to unite a divided nation – a festival to celebrate the best of British, bring communities together and strengthen “our precious union”.Yet Theresa May is being warned that her plan for a Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland risks doing the opposite. The planned 2022 event, announced at last year’s Conservative conference, was criticised as a headline-grabbing distraction. But May now faces concerns that the timing clashes with the centenary of Irish partition and the civil war. Arts industry figures in Northern Ireland and some of those involved in the peace process are also understood to have concerns. These worries are revealed in a report by the thinktank British Future, which examined the potential for arts and heritage to bring the nation together. The study calls on the festival to be delayed by at least three years.What is now the Irish republic became the Irish Free State in 1922, while Northern Ireland remained part of the UK. A civil war erupted among Irish nationalists over the remaining links with Britain and raged for a year. Sunder Katwala, the report’s author, said: “Holding a festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 2022, on the centenary of Ireland’s partition and civil war, would be the worst possible timing. It is only likely to heighten tensions between communities – and that’s before we know Brexit’s implications for the border. Right across the UK, a festival so closely associated with Brexit may only reinforce divides when it could be bridging them.”Jonathan Powell, Tory Blair’s former chief of staff and one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement, also warned against anything that could inflame tensions, which have worsened given the prominent role of the Irish border in the Brexit debate.“There is going to be a lot of rebuilding to do in Anglo-Irish relations, which had been put on a completely new footing over the last 20 years and were then trashed by the Brexiters over the last couple of years,” he said. “An example is their constant attacks on [Irish prime minister Leo] Varadkar for hostility when all he is doing is protecting the interests of the Irish people. I fear it will take years to put this right.”The idea of a nationwide event was modelled on the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the Festival of Britain a century later, held to boost the nation’s spirits after the second world war. May was mocked on social media when she announced she was setting aside £120m to prepare for the event, with some suggesting the festival would only feature damp tents on village greens, an exhibition of the remaining avocados left in Britain and morris dancers. However, after holding focus groups, British Future found it could be more popular than critics think, should organisers get the tone and timing right. More than six in 10 thought the festival a good idea, with only one in 10 opposed, according to new ICM research.“The festival could be much more popular with the public than its social media critics think, and could help bridge social divides if done well,” Katwala said. “If not, it could be a second Millennium Dome. It risks being neglected, with the government stuck over Brexit and the prime minister who thought of it on her way out. The next prime minister will have to decide how to rescue this idea.”",Timing of May’s ‘festival of Britain’ risks Irish anger,2019-04-13/16:00:22,it was meant to be a glimmer of positivity to unite a divided nation a festival to celebrate the best of british bring communities together and strengthen our precious union yet theresa may is being warned that her plan for a festival of great britain and northern ireland risks doing the opposite the planned  event announced at last year s conservative conference was criticised as a headline grabbing distraction but may now faces concerns that the timing clashes with the centenary of irish partition and the civil war arts industry figures in northern ireland and some of those involved in the peace process are also understood to have concerns these worries are revealed in a report by the thinktank british future which examined the potential for arts and heritage to bring the nation together the study calls on the festival to be delayed by at least three years what is now the irish republic became the irish free state in  while northern ireland remained part of the uk a civil war erupted among irish nationalists over the remaining links with britain and raged for a year sunder katwala the report s author said holding a festival of great britain and northern ireland in  on the centenary of ireland s partition and civil war would be the worst possible timing it is only likely to heighten tensions between communities and that s before we know brexit s implications for the border right across the uk a festival so closely associated with brexit may only reinforce divides when it could be bridging them jonathan powell tory blair s former chief of staff and one of the architects of the good friday agreement also warned against anything that could inflame tensions which have worsened given the prominent role of the irish border in the brexit debate there is going to be a lot of rebuilding to do in anglo irish relations which had been put on a completely new footing over the last  years and were then trashed by the brexiters over the last couple of years he said an example is their constant attacks on irish prime minister leo varadkar for hostility when all he is doing is protecting the interests of the irish people i fear it will take years to put this right the idea of a nationwide event was modelled on the great exhibition of  and the festival of britain a century later held to boost the nation s spirits after the second world war may was mocked on social media when she announced she was setting aside m to prepare for the event with some suggesting the festival would only feature damp tents on village greens an exhibition of the remaining avocados left in britain and morris dancers however after holding focus groups british future found it could be more popular than critics think should organisers get the tone and timing right more than six in  thought the festival a good idea with only one in  opposed according to new icm research the festival could be much more popular with the public than its social media critics think and could help bridge social divides if done well katwala said if not it could be a second millennium dome it risks being neglected with the government stuck over brexit and the prime minister who thought of it on her way out the next prime minister will have to decide how to rescue this idea ,Brexit,0.181553155
2740,"Halloween might look like a fitting date for the end of the Brexit horror story, European media said, but Britain was by no means certain to leave the EU even then – and in any case, the damage had already been done.“‘Brexit means Brexit’, as Theresa May repeated for so long?” said France’s Libération. “Not really. You have to ask whether the UK will ever leave. The prime minister won a new delay from her EU partners: to 31 October. The date is not a very good omen … ”But whether Britain leaves in the autumn, or before, or not at all, the paper said, the “increasingly incomprehensible waltz of exit dates shows it has already succeeded in exporting its byzantine internal battles to Brussels … This summit shattered the united front that the Europeans had maintained for so long.”Barcelona’s La Vanguardia said the damage extended some way further than that. The basic problem remains “the inability of the two main British parties to interpret the decision taken by the people,” it said, leading to anger and resentment on both sides of the Channel.“Those who voted for Brexit have reason to feel aggrieved that after three years the UK is still a member of the EU. But the citizens of the 27 other member states also have reason to feel aggrieved at the way Brexit is sapping energy that could be spent on the great challenge of guaranteeing the social wellbeing of Europe’s citizens.”Italy’s La Stampa was not optimistic for the future. “Whatever the outcome of the last act of this tragedy, Brexit is destined to mark the future of Europe for at least a generation,” it said. “Confidence between the UK and the continent has been broken in a lasting way. And without mutual trust no project, political or commercial, is possible.”France’s Le Monde agreed Halloween, “the Anglo-Saxon festival of witches and pumpkins”, was perhaps a fitting date. But to agree on it, the paper said, the EU27 had to reach “a hard-fought and typically European compromise”.A majority of leaders, including Germany’s Angela Merkel, wanted “to put Brexit on ice for a year, allowing the bloc to get through a politically tricky period”. France’s Emmanuel Macron, however, wanted a far shorter extension, “to keep maximum pressure on the British … and put an end to the can-kicking”.In the end, the EU27 split the difference but “the Franco-German motor was clearly not functioning”, Le Monde said. And it remained the question “whether Brexit will ever actually happen … If Britain persists in its refusal to accept the exit deal and its incapacity to agree on the form of Brexit it wants, the EU, too, will face an impasse.”Germany’s Die Welt also felt the summit, even if it ended in a classic EU compromise, had shown Brexit “is no longer a British affair”. Macron’s hard line “aimed to scare the populists in his own country off similar anti-EU plans,” it said, while Berlin “sees a longer term danger in a lack of willingness to compromise”.For Die Zeit, the chosen exit date “could not be more symbolic: on 31 October, when the Halloween festival of horrors is being celebrated everywhere, Britain is set to leave the EU. For many, in Britain and on the continent, a truly scary moment … ”“It’s a Halloween Brexit,” echoed the Netherlands’ NRC Handelsblad, arguing that despite Macron’s warnings the final summit outcome reflected above all “the desire of almost all member states to avoid a no-deal Brexit – they set virtually no conditions on Britain’s continued membership, just a ‘good behaviour review’ in June.”Macron’s fears that a long extension would allow Britain to disrupt EU proceedings were overblown, the paper said: “There is little new legislation programmed this year, and important decisions such as the new president of the commission can by taken by majority vote.”",'It's a Halloween Brexit': European media's verdict on latest delay,2019-04-11/10:29:13,halloween might look like a fitting date for the end of the brexit horror story european media said but britain was by no means certain to leave the eu even then and in any case the damage had already been done brexit means brexit as theresa may repeated for so long said france s libération not really you have to ask whether the uk will ever leave the prime minister won a new delay from her eu partners to  october the date is not a very good omen but whether britain leaves in the autumn or before or not at all the paper said the increasingly incomprehensible waltz of exit dates shows it has already succeeded in exporting its byzantine internal battles to brussels this summit shattered the united front that the europeans had maintained for so long barcelona s la vanguardia said the damage extended some way further than that the basic problem remains the inability of the two main british parties to interpret the decision taken by the people it said leading to anger and resentment on both sides of the channel those who voted for brexit have reason to feel aggrieved that after three years the uk is still a member of the eu but the citizens of the  other member states also have reason to feel aggrieved at the way brexit is sapping energy that could be spent on the great challenge of guaranteeing the social wellbeing of europe s citizens italy s la stampa was not optimistic for the future whatever the outcome of the last act of this tragedy brexit is destined to mark the future of europe for at least a generation it said confidence between the uk and the continent has been broken in a lasting way and without mutual trust no project political or commercial is possible france s le monde agreed halloween the anglo saxon festival of witches and pumpkins was perhaps a fitting date but to agree on it the paper said the eu had to reach a hard fought and typically european compromise a majority of leaders including germany s angela merkel wanted to put brexit on ice for a year allowing the bloc to get through a politically tricky period france s emmanuel macron however wanted a far shorter extension to keep maximum pressure on the british and put an end to the can kicking in the end the eu split the difference but the franco german motor was clearly not functioning le monde said and it remained the question whether brexit will ever actually happen if britain persists in its refusal to accept the exit deal and its incapacity to agree on the form of brexit it wants the eu too will face an impasse germany s die welt also felt the summit even if it ended in a classic eu compromise had shown brexit is no longer a british affair macron s hard line aimed to scare the populists in his own country off similar anti eu plans it said while berlin sees a longer term danger in a lack of willingness to compromise for die zeit the chosen exit date could not be more symbolic on  october when the halloween festival of horrors is being celebrated everywhere britain is set to leave the eu for many in britain and on the continent a truly scary moment it s a halloween brexit echoed the netherlands nrc handelsblad arguing that despite macron s warnings the final summit outcome reflected above all the desire of almost all member states to avoid a no deal brexit they set virtually no conditions on britain s continued membership just a good behaviour review in june macron s fears that a long extension would allow britain to disrupt eu proceedings were overblown the paper said there is little new legislation programmed this year and important decisions such as the new president of the commission can by taken by majority vote ,Brexit,0.269889534
2751,"Britain will remain in the EU until the end of October this year, but diminished in power and status, with a review of its conduct set for the end of June. It is the marital equivalent of being sent to sleep in the spare bedroom, if not quite the garden shed.Wednesday night’s humiliation, when 27 other nations decided our fate – a taster of Norway-plus or “common market 2.0”, where decisions are made about the UK without our presence – exposes the lies of the Brexiters and the impossibility of a strong and stable position outside the EU. History will recall that Britons did not value their power in Europe until they lost it. Theresa May, too, was humiliated once again but it does not cut deeply since she appears to feels no shame. She remains convinced she was and is right: that blame is to be found with her detractors and not with her deal or leadership.The question that remains unanswered is: now what? Few EU leaders were convinced that the process of cross-party talks would lead to a deal that parliament could support, and rightly so. It is not in Jeremy Corbyn’s interest to rescue the Conservative party from a crisis of their own making. And for May, any deal acceptable to the Labour party would cause a perhaps permanent split in her own party, not seen since 1846 and the repeal of the corn laws.That’s why these negotiations were never offered in good faith – if they had been, the hardline Brexiters in the cabinet would have already resigned. Cabinet ministers from Jeremy Hunt to Geoffrey Cox seem unable to hide their duplicitous intentions, all but promising that a future Tory leader would rip up any deal.But none of this matters. Even if May and Corbyn were to reach a deal for a soft Brexit without a confirmatory public vote, then the bulk of Tory MPs would vote against it on substance and Labour MPs would vote it down on process. If May were to attempt to impose a three-line whip for a “people’s vote”, her government would shatter.If they were to conclude a deal, the party leaders could face a situation where the only MPs voting for it were on both frontbenches. It is the path pursued by desperate aides to the prime minister, but with little traction either in parliament, in the Tory party or in the labour movement.So it is a matter of when, not if, the talks between May and Corbyn break up. It seems quite likely that both sides will allow the fiction to continue during parliamentary recess so everyone can have a break (and who could blame them?). Indeed, both sides will remain around the table to avoid being seen to leave it first. Expect the blame game to get into full swing now.Yet the reality is that there is no parliamentary majority for any Brexit outcome – from no-deal through every variation of a Brexit deal, all the way to revocation – meaning that the only options left are processes. While the prime minister may attempt another round of indicative votes and yet another attempt to get her deal through, it will not succeed.Yet despite serving no useful purpose by remaining in office, May refuses to leave. If she were to resign as prime minister at the end of June she would avoid the embarrassment of serving a shorter time in office than Gordon Brown while giving her successor time to regroup over the summer.But be under no illusions: a new Tory leader and prime minister will not bring with them a fresh solution to the crisis. The parliamentary arithmetic will be unaltered.Whether now or in a few months hence, parliament will be confronted with a choice: either refer the Brexit question back to the people for their final say, or hold a general election to deliver a parliament capable of making a decision.In any general election, the Labour party will offer a minimum of a renegotiation and a referendum or even a promise to revoke article 50. When confronted with a choice between a referendum under a Conservative government or a referendum following a Labour election victory, enough Tory MPs may conclude that supporting a public vote now is the lesser of two evils.Either way, May’s premiership is doomed – and so may be the project to rip this country out of the EU.

2758,"For three years, Brexit arguments have, naturally enough, focused on the impact that leaving the European Union might have on Britain. Less attention has been paid to the effect of Britain’s departure on the rest of Europe. That is about to change. The response of European neighbours to choices forced on them by the UK is getting harder to ignore.A long article 50 extension would cover a turbulent phase in the European political cycle: European parliament elections; the appointment of a new commission; budget negotiations; the expiry of Donald Tusk’s term as council president. There is no precedent to indicate whether an exiting member can or should participate in those processes.EU summits have always been conducted on the assumption that everyone wants a collegiate outcome. There is still disagreement, deadlock and strife, but they are contained by a framework of common enterprise. That is no longer true with Brexit Britain, which is why other European leaders, led by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, want to curtail UK privileges as the price of an article 50 extension.It is not easy to sustain trust between a bloc of 27 EU members and a former ally loitering at the exit. It is much harder when the ruling party of the exiting country is a wellspring of anti-Brussels venom and when its MPs threaten to use their ongoing access to EU institutions for obstruction and vandalism. The breakdown in confidence works two ways. British ministers worry that any downgrade in status will be exploited to write anti-UK bias into the rules of future engagement across the Channel. But that is an intrinsic hazard of Brexit. There is no avoiding the diminution of influence that comes from surrendering a seat in the continent’s decision-making forums.The leave campaign denied it was so. Brexiters promised that Britain would be the stronger side in negotiations with the rest of Europe; that they needed us more than we needed them. It is true that Theresa May had cards to play: British economic clout and military and intelligence capabilities are assets that the EU would rather not lose. But that leverage had to be exercised delicately. The shrewd way would have been to signal moral and strategic support for the European project, develop diplomatic goodwill and then use British assets to purchase influence for the long term. But the opposite happened. Brexit came across as an aggressive project, culturally aligned to Donald Trump’s anti-Europeanism, which provoked an impulse in Brussels to minimise British influence. That wasn’t Mrs May’s intention, but she allowed virulent anti-EU nationalism to run wild in her party.EU leaders are frustrated with Britain, but they also recognise the necessity of maintaining healthy relations. The impulse to be rid of a nuisance neighbour is balanced by the calculation that an alienated, vindictive Britain poses more long-term threats. Sadly, the same equation is poorly understood in this country. Brexiters itch to escape EU institutional entanglements, but the country can never achieve pristine separation from the European project. Managing partnerships with our continental neighbours is an immovable fact of geography, diplomacy and economics. One approach to Brexit delay would be to reset those partnerships in a more constructive spirit. Another is to make them as difficult and dysfunctional as possible. It is clear which is the wiser path, but sadly also clear that Mrs May and her party are incapable of following it.",The Guardian view on Britain in Europe: an inevitable partnership,2019-04-10/18:34:20,for three years brexit arguments have naturally enough focused on the impact that leaving the european union might have on britain less attention has been paid to the effect of britain s departure on the rest of europe that is about to change the response of european neighbours to choices forced on them by the uk is getting harder to ignore a long article  extension would cover a turbulent phase in the european political cycle european parliament elections the appointment of a new commission budget negotiations the expiry of donald tusk s term as council president there is no precedent to indicate whether an exiting member can or should participate in those processes eu summits have always been conducted on the assumption that everyone wants a collegiate outcome there is still disagreement deadlock and strife but they are contained by a framework of common enterprise that is no longer true with brexit britain which is why other european leaders led by the french president emmanuel macron want to curtail uk privileges as the price of an article  extension it is not easy to sustain trust between a bloc of  eu members and a former ally loitering at the exit it is much harder when the ruling party of the exiting country is a wellspring of anti brussels venom and when its mps threaten to use their ongoing access to eu institutions for obstruction and vandalism the breakdown in confidence works two ways british ministers worry that any downgrade in status will be exploited to write anti uk bias into the rules of future engagement across the channel but that is an intrinsic hazard of brexit there is no avoiding the diminution of influence that comes from surrendering a seat in the continent s decision making forums the leave campaign denied it was so brexiters promised that britain would be the stronger side in negotiations with the rest of europe that they needed us more than we needed them it is true that theresa may had cards to play british economic clout and military and intelligence capabilities are assets that the eu would rather not lose but that leverage had to be exercised delicately the shrewd way would have been to signal moral and strategic support for the european project develop diplomatic goodwill and then use british assets to purchase influence for the long term but the opposite happened brexit came across as an aggressive project culturally aligned to donald trump s anti europeanism which provoked an impulse in brussels to minimise british influence that wasn t mrs may s intention but she allowed virulent anti eu nationalism to run wild in her party eu leaders are frustrated with britain but they also recognise the necessity of maintaining healthy relations the impulse to be rid of a nuisance neighbour is balanced by the calculation that an alienated vindictive britain poses more long term threats sadly the same equation is poorly understood in this country brexiters itch to escape eu institutional entanglements but the country can never achieve pristine separation from the european project managing partnerships with our continental neighbours is an immovable fact of geography diplomacy and economics one approach to brexit delay would be to reset those partnerships in a more constructive spirit another is to make them as difficult and dysfunctional as possible it is clear which is the wiser path but sadly also clear that mrs may and her party are incapable of following it ,Brexit,0.190294519
2914,"Brexit has prompted a recurring nightmare among an increasingly incredulous population: our very own Groundhog Day. Two weeks after the EU granted us an 11th-hour extension to prevent us crashing out without a deal, we are back in exactly the same position. The only thing standing between us and next Friday’s cliff edge is the hope the EU gifts us another extension. Meanwhile, the political turmoil engulfing the country worsens, the two main parties increasingly consumed by division and disarray and the political leadership we so desperately need to avert crisis as elusive as ever.It’s hard to believe that the Westminster model of democracy was one prized by constitutional theorists for the stability it purportedly delivers. As the stakes get higher, our political system has proved less and less capable of delivering a resolution to the gridlock that has infected Westminster.Labour has to choose between backing a referendum or striking a compromise on a softer BrexitBrexit has been a story of the favouring of party management over the national interest. From the very beginning, Theresa May’s approach to Brexit – from her premature decision to trigger article 50 to her red lines on freedom of movement and the customs union – has been driven not by a strategy to unite the country in the wake of a divisive referendum but to keep her Brexit ultras on side. Only now it has become clear that there are MPs in her party so fanatically dogmatic that they would rather hold out for no deal than vote for her deal has she opened compromise talks with Labour. But Labour emerged from the talks on Friday complaining that no changes to the political declaration were on offer, suggesting that this move may have been more about trying to lay blame for any further delay on the opposition.Labour’s strategy has been no less determined by party interest. Jeremy Corbyn has kept a position of barely credible ambiguity for as long as possible to avoid alienating any of its voters. Labour has maintained the charade that it could deliver a Brexit deal that delivers all the benefits of EU membership with none of costs. And Labour has failed to provide any leadership support for a confirmatory referendum on any Brexit deal, with the shadow cabinet split on the issue.Time is running out for Labour to decide once and for all whether it will properly swing its weight behind a referendum. Thanks to the mess the Tories are in, Corbyn is in a position of power, if he only chooses to use it. He could tell May that Labour MPs will back her withdrawal agreement only if she is prepared to put it to a confirmatory referendum. There is every chance that this would generate a cross-party majority for a referendum.Parliament should lead a national conversation with the public to shape negotiations with the EU in the coming yearsIt would be the right thing for Labour to do in principle. The terms of our exit are now clear in a way they simply weren’t when Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016. Voters were made misleading promises during that campaign. It would be unthinkable to leave without putting the terms of our exit back to voters for ratification.But it is also the right thing for Labour to do electorally. It can no longer credibly sit on the fence. Three-quarters of Labour voters think Britain was wrong to vote to leave the EU. With no failsafe way of triggering a general election, Labour has to choose between backing a referendum or striking a compromise on a softer Brexit. But the latter is fraught with danger: there are no guarantees that May can make that would be binding on any successor, were there to be a general election during the negotiations about our future relationship with the EU. Labour could end up being blamed for facilitating a hard Brexit.If the EU does grant us a long extension, the biggest risk is that it simply gets wasted and we find ourselves here again for a third time in a few months. If recent weeks have shown anything, it’s that not even the most perilous cliff edge is enough to force a deal. A long extension could see both parties slide backwards from compromise. The Conservative party looks likely to select a hard Brexiter to succeed May, one who might set tougher red lines around which it is harder, not easier, to generate a parliamentary consensus. Labour might simply return to a position of constructive ambiguity.It is imperative that any long extension is put to good use. MPs must rally behind holding a confirmatory referendum giving a choice between any agreed withdrawal agreement versus the status quo. If the public votes to accept the withdrawal agreement, that still leaves a big question mark over our future relationship with Europe. Parliament should lead a national conversation with the public, using citizens’ assemblies, to shape negotiations with the EU in the coming years. It is far too important to leave to the dominant faction of a single political party.The chaos over Brexit will likely have done irreparable damage to public confidence in our political system. Our two-party, majoritarian political system has struggled to represent the preferences of a more pluralistic electorate, divided on issues such as Brexit that cross the left-right spectrum. The current political crisis is not just the product of an utter vacuum of contemporary political leadership but of the strong incentives in our political system for leaders to try to hold their parties together above all else.

3165,"The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has accused the government of running down the clock and “bullying and threatening” MPs as it tried to force through Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Speaking in Newport, south Wales, before a byelection on Thursday, Corbyn also refused to say what his party’s parliamentary tactics would be during a second round of indicative votes due to take place on Monday.He said that the option of giving the public a confirmatory referendum on any Brexit deal “is the Labour position so far, but there hasn’t been enough support for that across the floor in the House of Commons”.During this week’s indicative votes, the option for a public vote was whipped by Labour but was defeated by 295 to 268 votes, with 27 of the party’s MPs rebelling.Corbyn said: “The absolute priority at the moment is to end this chaos the government has brought us to by their endlessly running down the clock and basically bullying and threatening people. The bullying hasn’t worked, the threats haven’t worked. It’s time now for the sensible people to take over.”He cautioned: “This is a very dangerous period, because if we crash out without a deal then the supply chains get interrupted, jobs are at stake, and also the sense of security of many EU nationals living in Britain, and of course British people living across Europe.”Labour would propose a deal involving a customs union with the EU to prevent the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland, Corbyn said.“We are working very hard on that and reaching out to people all across the Commons, and I have been doing that all this week and obviously I’ll be doing that all this weekend,” he added.“However people voted in the referendum, no one voted to lose their jobs, no one voted to be worse off, and no one voted to deregulate our society.“I think the obvious choice is the one I suggested, which would be a good economic relationship with Europe that could be negotiated. I’m convinced of that after spending a lot of time meeting with and talking to officials in Europe.”Thursday’s byelection, in the Newport West constituency, follows the death of the Labour MP Paul Flynn in February.",Brexit: Corbyn accuses government of ‘bullying’ MPs,2019-03-30/17:01:08+0000,the labour leader jeremy corbyn has accused the government of running down the clock and bullying and threatening mps as it tried to force through theresa may s brexit deal speaking in newport south wales before a byelection on thursday corbyn also refused to say what his party s parliamentary tactics would be during a second round of indicative votes due to take place on monday he said that the option of giving the public a confirmatory referendum on any brexit deal is the labour position so far but there hasn t been enough support for that across the floor in the house of commons during this week s indicative votes the option for a public vote was whipped by labour but was defeated by  to  votes with  of the party s mps rebelling corbyn said the absolute priority at the moment is to end this chaos the government has brought us to by their endlessly running down the clock and basically bullying and threatening people the bullying hasn t worked the threats haven t worked it s time now for the sensible people to take over he cautioned this is a very dangerous period because if we crash out without a deal then the supply chains get interrupted jobs are at stake and also the sense of security of many eu nationals living in britain and of course british people living across europe labour would propose a deal involving a customs union with the eu to prevent the return of a hard border in northern ireland corbyn said we are working very hard on that and reaching out to people all across the commons and i have been doing that all this week and obviously i ll be doing that all this weekend he added however people voted in the referendum no one voted to lose their jobs no one voted to be worse off and no one voted to deregulate our society i think the obvious choice is the one i suggested which would be a good economic relationship with europe that could be negotiated i m convinced of that after spending a lot of time meeting with and talking to officials in europe thursday s byelection in the newport west constituency follows the death of the labour mp paul flynn in february ,Brexit,0.278795719
3166,"Having long ago decided that there was no point expecting anything sensible to emerge from Westminster Brexit-wise, Europe’s press greeted the inevitable third Commons defeat for Theresa May’s deal with a collective, if bitter, shrug.“Season four of Brexiternity is now under way and will probably air next week,” said France’s Libération, breezily. “After three defeats, the PM is supposedly going to try a fourth time. Unreal? Unthinkable? Of course not. Uncertainty reigns, there is no plan B, and all options, more or less, remain open.”Le Figaro did not spare the irony. “The day Britain was supposed to leave the EU, its parliament voted against the exit deal while thousands of demonstrators protested outside against the ‘treason’ of their politicians,” the paper said.“And now? If the country has been in the grip of political chaos for months, the period that lies ahead looks set to attain hitherto unexplored heights of uncertainty. Unless a solution is found, Britain will crash out of EU without a deal on 12 April.”The Irish Independent said classic comedy fans were now “running out of Brexit analogies”. Monty Python’s Black Knight and dead parrot had already been enlisted to portray Theresa May and her deal, the paper said, while Laurel and Hardy were sadly unavailable to do justice to Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson.“But the humour is becoming dark as the gallows of Brexit approaches,” it added. “All options have now been examined, and the inability of Britain’s parliamentary system to find any sort of resolution makes a mockery of their democracy.”In Germany, Die Zeit said Britain was “in dire straits: parliament and government are at odds. If they do not agree within a few days, the country risks serious economic and political chaos, causing great suffering to future generations.”The country has been “living from one deadline to the next for weeks, without a clear way out”, it said. “The people no longer know who rules them, or where their politics is taking them. There is not a Briton who is not shocked. Brexit has not made Britain stronger: it is in a sorry state.”The fault was not all May’s, it added. “But she has led not in the national interest, but to preserve the popularity of the Conservative party … Not consensus, diplomacy and conviction, but stubborn self-interest,” it argued. Now the system has “one last chance” to avoid a disastrous no deal.Belgium’s De Standaard said in an editorial that the deal’s third defeat showed how deeply Britain was now divided. “It was no real surprise,” the paper said. “Just the final proof that the British political system has been completely broken by Brexit. In essence, it added, there is “no majority to be found for any form of Brexit”.Sweden’s Dagens Nyheter said that although “everything in Britain has revolved around Brexit” for what seems like for ever, the country “appears now to be back at square one.

3258,"Donald Tusk issued a rallying call to the “increasing majority” of British people who want to cancel Brexit and stay in the EU, hours before MPs were given the chance to back a second referendum.In a stirring intervention on Wednesday, the European council president praised those who marched on the streets of London and the millions who are petitioning the government to revoke article 50.Speaking to the European parliament, Tusk reprimanded those who voiced concerns about a potential lengthy extension to article 50 in the event of the Commons rejecting the withdrawal agreement again this week.Tusk said: “Let me make one personal remark to the members of this parliament. Before the European council, I said that we should be open to a long extension if the UK wishes to rethink its Brexit strategy, which would of course mean the UK’s participation in the European parliament elections. And then there were voices saying that this would be harmful or inconvenient to some of you.“Let me be clear: such thinking is unacceptable. You cannot betray the 6 million people who signed the petition to revoke article 50, the 1 million people who marched for a people’s vote, or the increasing majority of people who want to remain in the European Union.”To heckling from Ukip MEPs, Tusk went on: “They may feel that they are not sufficiently represented by the UK parliament, but they must feel that they are represented by you in this chamber. Because they are Europeans.”In London, MPs voted to seize control of the parliamentary timetable on Monday to allow the House of Commons to explore over the coming days whether there could be support for alternatives to Theresa May’s twice-defeated Brexit deal, including a possible second public vote.That proposal, put forward by the former Labour cabinet minister Margaret Beckett, lost by 27 votes on Wednesday evening, the second smallest loss among the eight solutions to the Brexit impasse, offering some hope to campaigners in future votes to come. But EU sources said they were concerned that the UK parliament was still unable to coalesce around a solution, saying: “Our interlocutor remains the British government.”The Guardian revealed on Wednesday morning that the EU has pencilled in April Fools’ Day 2020 as a first day for the UK outside the bloc since 1973 if May fails to ratify her deal but seeks a long extension of article 50 on the basis that a new plan has emerged.The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage responded to Tusk by describing him as “deluded” and claiming that a second referendum would deliver a larger majority for leave.In a pantomime moment, Farage turned to those sat behind him to ask whether they really wanted him to return as an MEP. He ended his speech to the parliament by appealing to the EU’s leaders to “get the British out”.Later in the debate, Tusk hit back, saying: “Mr Farage, you have presented passionate arguments against a second referendum. But the truth is that the second referendum took place in 2016 because the first one took place in 1975. And then a vast majority of the British public decided that the place of the UK was in the European Economic Community.“No, it was you who thought three years ago that it was possible to organise a referendum to invalidate the previous one. Then please be consistent also today.”Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, also spoke, saying: “No one is trying to steal Brexit from you, no one is trying to undo the vote of the British people” but, he said, the UK would have to bear the consequences of its decisions.He said the EU’s leaders last week had allowed an extension of article 50 until 12 April to “open the possibility to the UK to shoulder its responsibility – it is now over to this country to shoulder that responsibility”.Tusk’s comments came as the British government emailed the 5.8 million people who have signed a UK parliament petition seeking the revocation of article 50. The email informed signatories that “this government will not revoke article 50”.The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, speaking after Tusk on the subject of Tuesday’s summit, told MEPs he awaited the Commons decision with interest.“The debate on China was far less complicated than the debate on the UK and I was saying to some of you that if I was to compare Great Britain to a sphinx, the sphinx would be an open book by comparison,” Juncker said. “Let’s see how that book speaks over the next week or so.”Barnier warned the British government that the Irish backstop, under which Northern Ireland would stay in the single market and the customs union, would continue to form the basis of the EU’s policy to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.","EU cannot betray ‘increasing majority’ who want UK to remain, says Tusk",2019-03-27/23:20:28+0000,donald tusk issued a rallying call to the increasing majority of british people who

3280,"Concern is growing in Norway and Iceland about how to respond if the UK’s House of Commons votes to apply to join Efta, the four-nation European free-trade association of which both countries are members.While the plan appeals to a growing cross-party lobby of British MPs, who see Efta membership as a compromise solution to leaving the EU yet keeping the UK’s close economic ties with the European single market, it has divided opinion within Efta member states. Iceland’s foreign minister, Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, a free trader, enthusiastically backed British membership of Efta on a visit to London this week. But he said it would be a challenge if the UK also sought to stay in the EU customs union, as proposed by the chief backers of the Norway option in the Commons. For British MPs, membership of the customs union would ease concerns over the border in Ireland.The four Efta members, Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Switzerland, currently strike their own free-trade deals with third countries outside the European Union, but the UK, if it negotiated to stay inside the EU customs union, would be excluded from doing this. This would reduce the chance of Efta becoming a large and attractive trading bloc, one of the advantages of Britain joining Efta from Iceland’s viewpoint.Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Þórðarson said he was not sure why the UK should wish to join the EU customs union after Brexit and added that any such decision would represent a challenge for Iceland.Iceland’s prime minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, was more wary about the UK joining Efta last week, stressing that the UK would need to accept free movement of labour.But in Norway, probably the single most influential country inside Efta, opinion appears to be hardening against UK membership as the option grows more likely. The concern is expressed openly by the opposition Labour party, and more warily in government circles.Anniken Huitfeldt, head of the Foreign and Defence committee and a Labour member, said she was not interested in the UK joining either Efta or the European economic area, the single market grouping that assembles the EU and and Efta members. She said: “We do not encourage them. It is not in Norway’s interests to bring Britain into the EEA … The UK should never have voted to leave the EU in the first place.”The leader of Norway’s opposition Labour party, Jonas Gahr Støre, speaking to the Guardian, expressed his doubts about UK membership of Efta or the European Economic Area. He said: “All decisions are taken by consensus and it is not obvious that Britain and Norway would see eye to eye on all decisions that came from Brussels regarding the internal market. There is in the political debate in Norway a concern that a British presence could make our relationship more unstable, and I think that is reflected in the statements made by the current government and the opposition“Norway would like to see smooth, open and friendly relations with our partners across the North sea. Whether that objective is secured by the UK joining Efta or the EEA is a different question.”He pointed out that after 40 years of membership of the European Union and after 2016 referendum, the British would by joining the EEA “be gaining a new set of obligations but with far less influence and codetermination”. The head of Norway’s business group NHO, Tore Myhre, last week also urged the country not to reopen the agreement by inviting the British into Efta. He said: “Norway’s existing deal is fragile and it is important for us not to put it at risk.”Norway’s foreign minister, Ine Eriksen Søreide, pressed on TV last week to say whether she would support a British application to join Efta, avoided the question, focusing on the need for an orderly Brexit.Similarly, appeals by British MPs that support the Norway option for the Norwegian government to make a public invitation to join Efta have been spurned by ministers anxious not to be seen to be interfering inBrexit politics.Some Norwegian officials say privately that the underlying fear of British Efta membership is that the UK would dominate the organisation, and therefore its negotiations with the EU. One concern is that Norway might have to renegotiate its existing trade deals if the UK became a member.Moreover, it might cast a disruptive light on an arrangement that despite its democratic pitfalls has worked for Norway’s economy by providing access to the EU single market, excluding agriculture and fish.Norway, a country that tries to operate by political consensus, has long accepted an uneasy compromise in which it accepts the four EU freedoms, including freedom of movement, but remains outside the EU, as its citizens voted twice in referenda to reject EU membership. One official said: “There is a wariness about the British controversy over EU relations being imported into our arrangements. The issue has torn the UK apart for two years. We want to avoid upsetting something that works for us.”",Efta countries wary of UK's interest in 'Norway' option,2019-03-27/15:03:24+0000,concern is growing in norway and iceland about how to respond

3283,"Michael Gove has admitted the government’s plan to waive all tariffs on goods crossing the Irish border into Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit could be legally challenged under World Trade Organization rules.The environment secretary told MPs that legal advice had been sought, and it was “certainly the case that other countries could have an arguable case at [the] WTO” over a zero-tariff plan for Ireland.But he said the political needs outweighed those concerns. “We believe there are specific exemptions because of the broader political and security situation in Northern Ireland underpinning the Good Friday agreement, which mean that we can be allowed to do everything that we can.“Of course we couldn’t keep this situation indefinitely but we can do everything we can for a period in order to maintain a frictionless border,” Gove told the environment select committee.Under the no-deal tariff plan the UK would levy import tariffs on beef, lamb, pork and dairy products if it crashed out of the EU but waive them in Northern Ireland to avoid putting infrastructure on the Irish border.The plan, revealed two weeks ago, has caused controversy in Northern Ireland with claims the double standards could prove disastrous for farmers who would face EU tariffs on dairy and meat products exported into Irish food processing plants that made everything from pizza toppings to cheese and infant milk formula.This could be deemed illegal under WTO rules, which must be applied equally to all countries.Neil Parish, a Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told Gove the no-deal tariff regime for Irish exporters would “crush” Northern Ireland’s agrifood industry and lead to bankruptcies and business closures.“It would certainly put Northern Ireland’s agrifood industry at a disadvantage, yes,” Gove replied.He admitted the zero-tariff plan could have a “significant impact” on the dairy industry.Goves warning comes as Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party continues to withhold support for Theresa May’s Brexit deal over Irish border issues.It has put the DUP at odds with local businesses and farmers, who say no deal would be a disaster as they would have to compete with cheaper food coming in from Ireland but face tariffs on their own exports of dairy, beef and lamb across the border.About a third of all Northern Irish milk goes to the Irish Republic to be processed into butter, cheese and infant formula, while 400,000 sheep are exported a year to Ireland for slaughter and meat processing.Parish asked Gove whether he would deploy emergency measures to protect Northern Irish farmers.Gove said he had met representatives from Northern Ireland’s Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs on Monday and had told the department he would “provide whatever support they request to the best of our ability”.Gove revealed his department had 2,800 staff working on Brexit, with 55 seconded from Natural England and 30 from

3313,"Brexit would inflict immediate and profound economic shocks on Ireland, hitting households, businesses and government finances, according to a study.Britain’s departure from the European Union, with or without a deal, would cause significant damage to jobs and economic growth, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) said in a comprehensive report published on Tuesday.A decade after Brexit, Ireland’s output would be 2.6%, 4.8% or 5% lower than if Britain had stayed in the EU, it said, painting a stark picture as policymakers in Dublin try to grapple with a possibly imminent blow.A disorderly no-deal Brexit would mean 80,000 fewer jobs being created in Ireland over a decade, derailing the government’s budget planning, said the thinktank, which works closely with the Department of Finance.If Britain departed with a deal – the most benign scenario – 45,000 fewer jobs would be created, it found.Damage from a managed no-deal departure, a third scenario, would lie between those extremes.Both no-deal scenarios envisage sterling dropping around 7% against the euro over a decade, leading to higher import prices for consumers.“The impact of each Brexit scenario is considerable and will have negative effects throughout the economy on the household sector, the labour market, firms and the public finances,” said the report’s lead author, Adele Bergin.“Overall, in each scenario, the level of Irish output is permanently below where it otherwise would have been were the UK to decide to remain in the EU. However, the negative impact on Irish output in the long run in the deal scenario is approximately half that of the no-deal scenario.”The report will fuel alarm in Dublin.“As every day passes, no-deal does become more likely,” Leo Varadkar, the prime minister, said on Monday. “So we’re intensifying our no-deal preparations. They have been very much under way now for months, if not years. They are being intensified and finalised at the moment. We need to see now what happens in Westminster over the next couple of days and weeks and we’ll take it from there.”With Westminster in flux over the fate of Brexit, some Irish officials say Dublin’s projected image of readiness belies deep anxiety verging on dread about what may unfold.Ireland exports €4.5bn (£3.8bn) worth of food and drink a year to the UK, ranging from beef to cheddar cheese. It imports €33bn (£28bn) worth of products from the UK – more than China – leaving Irish consumers and companies vulnerable to disruption.Opposition parties have broadly supported Varadkar’s Brexit strategy but are preparing to pounce if a shock hits.Michael McGrath, a finance spokesperson for the main opposition party Fianna Fáil, said the ESRI report exposed the “folly” of Varadkar recently promising tax cuts.“This was an irresponsible promise to make in light of the deep uncertainty facing our country at this time as a result of Brexit … the key point is that the estimated impact on Ireland is worse than was previously thought.”Katie Daughen, the head of Brexit policy for the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, said big companies had the resources to prepare for Brexit and small companies had the nimbleness to respond to whatever happened, but medium-sized companies were vulnerable.The agri-food sector and importers who depended on raw materials from the UK were especially exposed, she said.The weakened pound is already affecting tourism.

Last week, May’s government held lengthy talks with senior MPs in the party, including Jeffrey Donaldson and Nigel Dodds.DUP leaders have been unimpressed with the way May and her team have negotiated with the EU, and believe they will have to be closely involved if the government is to leave with a deal that keeps Northern Ireland closely aligned with Britain.In a telephone call, Foster told the prime minister she would not change her party’s stance, which is to vote against the deal, if as expected it comes before the House of Commons this week. “The position remains unchanged,” a DUP source said.Hours later, May said the lack of a functioning devolved government in Stormont – suspended two years ago following a row between the DUP and Sinn Féin – made it difficult to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.“I am conscious of my duties as prime minister to all parts of our United Kingdom and of the damage to that union leaving without a deal could do when one part of it is without devolved government and unable therefore to prepare properly,” she said.Dodds, the DUP’s leader in Westminster, replied by criticising May’s “fundamental lack of preparation” for Brexit.“The prime minister has known for some considerable time, and so has the house, that 29 March was the target date, so why haven’t appropriate preparations been made?“This is a fundamental lack of preparation and the government’s entirely responsible for that, if that’s the case,” he said.Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, accused May of using the Irish border as an excuse for failing to deliver Brexit.“When are you going to stop using Northern Ireland as an excuse? And do you realise that the importance of this agreement to delivering Brexit, and also to the union of the United Kingdom, is such that we will not be used in a scare tactic to push this through?” he said.DUP figures are already turning their thoughts to the next confidence and supply agreement, which will be raised by the party over the next two months. May’s government is highly dependent on the 10 votes of the DUP.An informed source said: “Confidence and supply two is nearly upon us. It’s almost two years, so we’ll have to work on it. We aren’t in a coalition, but it’s pretty close. If anything, C&S2 will have to be even tighter than C&S1. Not talking about putting people in cabinet or anything like that, but deeply involved in every decision, especially on Brexit.”The party negotiated £1bn in spending for Northern Ireland as part of a first confidence and supply agreement with the Tories in 2017 – giving the government a working majority.Claims of splits in the DUP over whether to support May’s deal have been denied by the party. A DUP spokesman said: “The party is focused on securing a way forward as we exit the EU which respects the referendum result and protects the Union. Confidence and supply discussions are for another time.”",DUP rejects Theresa May's personal plea to support her deal,2019-03-25/17:37:57+0000,theresa may s hopes that she can force her withdrawal deal through parliament faded on monday after the democratic unionist party leader arlene foster rejected a personal plea for support the prime minister then enraged the pro leave party further by implying that preparations for a no deal brexit on the issue of the irish border had not progressed because the northern ireland assembly had been suspended support from the dup is critical to may s hopes of getting parliament to approve her brexit plan last week may s government held lengthy talks with senior mps in the party including jeffrey donaldson and nigel dodds dup leaders have been unimpressed with the way may and her team have negotiated with the eu and believe they will have to be closely involved if the government is to leave with a deal that keeps northern ireland closely aligned with britain in a telephone call foster told the prime minister she would not change her party s stance which is to vote against the deal if as expected it comes before the house of commons this week the position remains unchanged a dup source said hours later may said the lack of a functioning devolved government in stormont suspended two years ago following a row between the dup and sinn féin made it difficult to prepare for a no deal brexit i am conscious of my duties as prime minister to all parts of our united kingdom and of the damage to that union leaving without a deal could do when one part of it is without devolved government and unable therefore to prepare properly she said dodds the dup s leader in westminster replied by criticising may s fundamental lack of preparation for brexit the prime minister has known for some considerable time and so has the house that  march was the target date so why haven t appropriate preparations been made this is a fundamental lack of preparation and the government s entirely responsible for that if that s the case he said sammy wilson the dup s brexit spokesman accused may of using the irish border as an excuse for failing to deliver brexit when are you going to stop using northern ireland as an excuse and do you realise that the importance of this agreement to delivering brexit and also to the union of the united kingdom is such that we will not be used in a scare tactic to push this through he said dup figures are already turning their thoughts to the next confidence and supply agreement which will be raised by the party over the next two months may s government is highly dependent on the  votes of the dup an informed source said confidence and supply two is nearly upon us it s almost two years so we ll have to work on it we aren t in a coalition but it s pretty close if anything c s will have to be even tighter than c s not talking about putting people in cabinet or anything like that but deeply involved in every decision especially on brexit the party negotiated bn in spending for northern ireland as part of a first confidence and supply agreement with the tories in  giving the government a working majority claims of splits in the dup over whether to support may s deal have been denied by the party a dup spokesman said the party is focused on securing a way forward as we exit the eu which respects the referendum result and protects the union confidence and supply discussions are for another time ,Brexit,0.274208397
3404,"European media covered Saturday’s mammoth anti-Brexit demonstration in London with ill-concealed relish, before turning to reports of Theresa May’s imminent departure – and, in some cases, a first draft of her political obituary.“Historic demonstration in London for a second vote,” was Le Monde’s headline, above an extensive report from its London correspondent noting that more than a million people had taken to the streets “in a country where protest is not the norm”.The paper praised the crowd as “calm but determined, a sea of European blue … with not a single policeman in sight, but not a single incident either”. Compared with previous anti-Brexit marches, this one, it said, was “rather more about the failings of Theresa May’s government, and rather less about Europe”.Libération, too, noted the “peaceful and good-natured” mood. “And what if, after all, life was simpler than Brexit?” the paper asked. “What if it was a poster that made thousands laugh, a picnic on a crowded patch of grass, dogs and babies draped in European flags, and a carnival atmosphere on a Saturday in spring?”But beneath the joyful surface, it said, flowed “altogether more sinister currents”, with conservative commentators talking of a betrayal of democracy, MPs unable to go home for the weekend because of fears for their safety, and the woman responsible for the online petition to revoke article 50 also facing death threats.Germany’s Die Zeit said the demonstration’s timing was perfect, coming as it did “at the end of one of the most dramatic weeks in British politics in many years … May’s negotiations with the EU have failed, she has lost control of the Brexit process, and the danger of a no-deal Brexit looms”.The paper highlighted a recent YouGov poll indicating support for Brexit was falling even among leave voters, said the UK economy was “already experiencing difficulties”, and suggested “chaotic scenes during MPs’ Brexit debates have finally robbed many voters of all confidence that the government has things under control”.Like many European papers, De Volkskrant in the Netherlands picked up UK reports that May was in difficulty. “It is, as far as her ministers are concerned, no longer a question of whether she should go, but when,” the paper said. “Under her, Downing Street has become a bunker.”The paper said May “lacks the communication skills, the capacity for creative thinking and the political flexibility to make a success of Brexit”.It added: “She speaks mostly in platitudes: ‘Brexit means Brexit’, ‘strong and stable’, ‘smooth and orderly’.”But above all, the paper concluded: “Brexit was, for her, a way to control immigration. This was a red line that ruled out other options in the negotiations and led, inevitably, to the present impasse.”Spain’s El País said Britain’s politicians had “still not found a solution to Brexit, almost three years after the referendum”, prompting hundreds of thousands to take to the streets in London to protest “against Brexit, the failure of MPs to reach a decision and, mainly, to demand a new referendum”.The paper translated – with contextual notes where needed – the march’s 20 best placards, from “Even Arsenal are still in Europe” through “Pulling out doesn’t work – just ask my parents” and “Less Farage, more fromage” to “I’m incandescent with rage – but I’m British, so I’m just holding up a sign”.Reports of the UK’s meltdown reached well beyond Europe, with the press in Venezuela – itself hardly a stranger to political chaos – also covering Saturday’s Put it to the People march extensively in its Sunday editions.",European media delight in covering anti-Brexit march,2019-03-24/18:00:11+0000,european media covered saturday s mammoth anti brexit demonstration in london with ill concealed relish before turning to reports of theresa may s imminent departure and in some cases a first draft of her political obituary historic demonstration in london for a second vote was le monde s headline above an extensive report from its london correspondent noting that more than a million people had taken to the streets in a country where protest is not the norm the paper praised the crowd as calm but determined a sea of european blue with not a single policeman in sight but not a single incident either compared with previous anti brexit marches this one it said was rather more about the failings of theresa may s government and rather less about europe libération too noted the peaceful and good natured mood and what if after all life was simpler than brexit the paper asked what if it was a poster that made thousands laugh a picnic on a crowded patch of grass dogs and babies draped in european flags and a carnival atmosphere on a saturday in spring but beneath the joyful surface it said flowed altogether more sinister currents with conservative commentators talking of a betrayal of democracy mps unable to go home for the weekend because of fears for their safety and the woman responsible for the online petition to revoke article  also facing death threats germany s die zeit said the demonstration s timing was perfect coming as it did at the end of one of the most dramatic weeks in british politics in many years may s negotiations with the eu have failed she has lost control of the brexit process and the danger of a no deal brexit looms the paper highlighted a recent yougov poll indicating support for brexit was falling even among leave voters said the uk economy was already experiencing difficulties and suggested chaotic scenes during mps brexit debates have finally robbed many voters of all confidence that the government has things under control like many european papers de volkskrant in the netherlands picked up uk reports that may was in difficulty it is as far as her ministers are concerned no longer a question of whether she should go but when the paper said under her downing street has become a bunker the paper said may lacks the communication skills the capacity for creative thinking and the political flexibility to make a success of brexit it added she speaks mostly in platitudes brexit means brexit strong and stable smooth and orderly but above all the paper concluded brexit was for her a way to control immigration this was a red line that ruled out other options in the negotiations and led inevitably to the present impasse spain s el país said britain s politicians had still not found a solution to brexit almost three years after the referendum prompting hundreds of thousands to take to the streets in london to protest against brexit the failure of mps to reach a decision and mainly to demand a new referendum the paper translated with contextual notes where needed the march s  best placards from even arsenal are still in europe through pulling out doesn t work just ask my parents and less farage more fromage to i m incandescent with rage but i m british so i m just holding up a sign reports of the uk s meltdown reached well beyond europe with the press in venezuela itself hardly a stranger to political chaos also covering saturday s put it to the people march extensively in its sunday editions ,Brexit,0.194375873
3431,"‘You want this Brexit process to be over and done with.” Last Wednesday, Theresa May presumed to speak for the whole nation in a catastrophically judged TV address to the public. Yet, as Britain teeters on the edge of crashing out of the EU without a deal, which would surely be the worst national disaster since the Second World War, the disconnect between voters and the actions being taken in their name has perhaps never been greater. Just 14% of voters say they think the deal the prime minister is trying to ram through parliament delivers the type of Brexit people voted for in 2016.It is this yawning gulf between public sentiment and government action that propelled more than a million people from all over the country to take to the streets of the capital today in a compelling demonstration of disdain for the prime minister’s tactics and support for a popular vote on the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU. Critics have accused the protesters of staging a last-ditch attempt to overturn the result of the referendum. But the historic march represents something far more significant: the growing number of voters unwilling to allow politicians in thrall to ideological obsessions or narrow party interests to use an ill-defined and chimerical notion of the “will of the people” to drive through divisive and potentially catastrophic agendas.Theresa May has consistently sowed division where she should have tried to generate national consensusThe marchers have made their voices heard. They must be heeded. The initiative now passes to parliament. Will MPs heed the reminder that more than 16 million people voted to remain in the EU in 2016 and that the most important job of government in the wake of a narrow victory for Leave was to try to forge a path that healed a divided country?May has consistently sowed division where she should have tried to generate national consensus. She has pursued a Brexit strategy designed first and foremost to keep the Conservative party unified and her premiership secure, the national interest barely an afterthought. And she has ridden roughshod over parliament at every turn: resisting giving it a say over triggering article 50; granting a meaningful vote on her deal only when compelled to do so; attempting to force MPs into voting for her deal by delaying vote after vote to take us closer to the cliff edge.May’s televised address last week was the culmination of that strategy. “I am on your side,” she intoned to voters. “Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice.” She embraced populist language that could have been uttered by any tinpot dictator looking to trample the democratic institutions frustrating their personal agenda. In our parliamentary democracy, May’s mandate to lead the country comes purely from any support she commands from the House of Commons. Her words were not only self-defeating but bordering on the dangerously unconstitutional.The 2016 referendum established nothing more than that there was a narrow majority of voters in favour of leaving the EU. No concrete plan for leaving the EU was presented during the campaign; on the contrary, it was characterised by contradictory claims and a denial that Brexit would involve trade-offs. Yet May invented a mandate that would bolster Tory unity, adopting red lines on scrapping freedom of movement and leaving the customs union that reflected her party’s Eurosceptic flank rather than public sentiment. In a citizens’ assembly, run by University College London’s constitution unit in 2017, whose members were demographically representative of the UK and of the Leave-Remain split, 70% were in favour of maintaining freedom of movement by the end of the deliberative process, so long as the UK made full use of existing controls. The real impetus for May’s Brexit comes not from the “will of the people” but from the hard right of the Conservative party.Labour’s position on Brexit has been no less parochial. Jeremy Corbyn has sought to maintain an ambiguous position on Brexit for as long as possible, ignoring the views of a huge proportion of his party members. He has failed to capitalise on May’s weaknesses to provide the leadership Britain so desperately needs. Both parties are riven by Brexit divides, rendering the political system helpless to respond to the crisis engulfing Westminster.Even though parliament had expressed its opposition to leaving on Friday without a deal, this looked distinctly possible as a result of the dangerous political stasis that had set in. But at the 11th hour, the EU granted a reprieve, postponing the Leave date by two weeks to 12 April, the cutoff for the UK notifying the EU it will take part in this year’s European elections. May has until then to get her deal through. If not, we must either request a longer extension, contingent on taking part in European elections, or leave without a deal.The calls for May to resign from within her own party have increased in intensity this weekend. But this would achieve nothing save plunging the Conservative party into a leadership contest and the country into even deeper crisis. The only way forward is for parliament to wrest control from the government this week and hold a series of indicative votes to try to establish which route commands most support in the Commons.The only way forward is for parliament to wrest control from the government and hold a series of indicative votesSeveral MPs have been advocating a Norway-plus type deal. This is certainly the least bad form of Brexit, although it would significantly reduce the UK’s influence over the laws and rules with which it would need to continue to comply. But a major question mark hanging over this proposal is whether the cross-party coalition in favour of Norway-plus could be sustained over the months, even years, that it would take to negotiate. There will be no agreement about the UK’s future relationship until after Brexit. A soft-Brexit coalition of MPs could risk handing a blank cheque to any future prime minister to negotiate whatever agreement they see fit and present this versus no deal to MPs at the end of the transition phase.The best option by far remains a referendum on May’s withdrawal deal versus the status quo. The 2016 referendum put no concrete proposal to leave the EU on the table and it would be unthinkable to leave without asking voters to ratify the terms of our exit. If voters choose to support May’s deal, Brexit must be followed by a national conversation about the UK’s future relationship with the EU, informed by a national citizens’ assembly.May has shown, time and again, that she is on the side of whatever she believes best binds the Conservative party together. It is entirely conceivable that, in the event of her deal being voted down again, she ignores parliament and opts for no deal to secure her legacy as the prime minister who delivered Brexit. On Saturday, Britons turned out in their many hundreds of thousands to deliver their judgment of the strategy of May’s government so far.

3435,"Calls for a public inquiry into Brexit are mounting among diplomats, business figures, peers and MPs, amid claims that the civil service is already planning for a future investigation into how it has been handled.The decision to call the referendum, the red lines drawn up by Theresa May and Britain’s negotiating strategy are all issues that senior figures would like to be examined.Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said an inquiry was needed into “the biggest humiliation since Suez, certainly since the IMF crisis [in 1976]”. The cross-party peer said he believed the civil service “is both expecting and preparing for this”.“We do need to understand how on earth we ended up where we have and it probably needs to go back to the decisions around holding a referendum and the way the question was framed,” he said. “It would need to be a public inquiry, probably judge-led.”Peter Ricketts, the former national security adviser and former head civil servant in the Foreign Office, cited the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war. “Chilcot took a long time, but it was cathartic,” he said. “The report was widely seen to have done the job and I think you can say the British system is better for it. I think the handling of Brexit has been such a failure of the process of government, with such wide ramifications, that there needs to be a searching public inquiry.“What advice was given to ministers? Was it taken? Did the processes of collective cabinet decision-taking work? Were the right skills available, for example on no-deal planning and all the costs involved? They are all legitimate questions for an inquiry. It should have the powers of a judicial inquiry.”One senior Tory peer said: “We want our Chilcot.”Sir Mike Rake, the former chair of BT, said: “When the dust has settled, there really should be some kind of public inquiry, looking at both the issues around holding a referendum and the context of what has happened in terms of pursuing Brexit.”Many figures are already pointing to May’s early decision to set out strict red lines that seriously limited Britain’s ability to negotiate. John Kerr, Britain’s former EU ambassador who drafted the article 50 process of leaving the bloc, said: “Those red lines laid down in 2016 emerged with no consultation with the country, the devolved assemblies, parliament or with the cabinet. Then there was the decision to trigger article, 50 still with no agreement in cabinet of where we wanted to end up.”Sir Jonathan Faull, a former senior EU official, said: “It would be surprising if the events relating to UK withdrawal from the EU were not the subject of one or more inquiries. An important initial question will be when to start. The 2015 election? The 2016 referendum? The article 50 notification? The scope ranges from Whitehall and Westminster to Belfast, Brussels and beyond.”There is also support in the Commons. Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “The government’s handling of Brexit has been a shambles from start to finish. It was a dereliction of duty to allow the country to get to this point, days before Brexit, in danger of crashing out with no deal or trying to force parliament to accept a deal it’s already rejected twice.

The best outcome now would be a long delay, and it’s not the worst thing in the world to ask people to vote for some MEPs, and certainly better than stockpiling medicine and turning Kent into a car park. “So I think the best outcome is a long delay where we rethink how we deliver on the referendum result and we try and find a majority for a compromise Brexit agreement and possibly have a second referendum.”Osborne was asked about calling Theresa May a “dead woman walking”, to which he said: “After that election she called [in 2017] … I never thought she could recover authority and I said it at the moment.”The education minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “If parliament decides to vote down the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement, then I think it would be political meltdown and parliament would have failed.” Zahawi also said he was not prepared to tell his constituents that the UK would take part in the EU elections. “Each and every one of us will have to ask ourselves the question: ‘Am I prepared to go back to my constituents and say we’re not leaving the EU, we’re going to go for a much longer extension, and we’re going to take part in the European elections?’ I’m not prepared to do that. I don’t think the prime minister is prepared to do that.”The comments came as hundreds of thousands of people head to London on Saturday to march on parliament calling for the public to be given a final say on Brexit. Protesters will travel from all over the UK and further afield for the People’s Vote campaign’s Put it to the People march, after a similar rally in October drew crowds of 700,000.

3456,"Britain is “dangerously close to the full-scale disaster” of a no-deal Brexit, Sir Richard Branson has claimed in an open letter, accusing Theresa May of acting against the national interest.The Virgin tycoon, who is not resident in the UK for tax purposes, said the economy had already sustained damage as a result of Brexit, and said a no-deal scenario would trigger a “multi-generational disaster”.He called for a public vote giving people the chance to choose between a range of options on what the UK’s future relationship with the EU should be.“This is a moment of profound national crisis for the UK,” said the billionaire, who was revealed in 2016 to be helping fund a group fighting to stop Brexit.“Prioritising party over country, the prime minister is no longer acting in the national interest. Instead, she has decided to pitch herself as the defender of the ‘people’ against the machinations of parliament,” Branson wrote. “By limiting the MPs’ choice yet again to one between her own deal and no deal at all, she is placing a dangerous bet.” Branson, who is worth £4.5bn thanks to his investments in air, rail, finance and leisure, said preparations for Brexit and the uncertainty around what form it would take had already cost the economy “billions”.“Thousands of jobs in Britain have been lost already, with many more redundancies on the horizon as manufacturers react to the looming threat of tariffs and supply chain disruptions,” he said.“More than a trillion pounds in assets are being moved to Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris, and other European cities as financial institutions begin to execute their contingency plans. And Brexit preparations alone have eaten up billions that could have been spent elsewhere.“These consequences are real and tangible. They affect people everywhere across the UK. They affect investment in the UK, the nation’s ability to trade goods and services, to travel, to jointly tackle global challenges, from climate change to terrorism.”He said the British electorate should be given a final say on Brexit, with all options left on the table, because their views might have changed since the referendum.Branson said if people were not given a final say, the government should revoke article 50 and restart the Brexit process.“There is little time to avoid a multi-generational disaster,” he concluded.",Richard Branson fears 'full-scale disaster' of no-deal Brexit,2019-03-22/15:53:44+0000,britain is dangerously close to the full scale disaster of a no deal brexit sir richard branson has claimed in an open letter accusing theresa may of acting against the national interest the virgin tycoon who is not resident in the uk for tax purposes said the economy had already sustained damage as a result of brexit and said a no deal scenario would trigger a multi generational disaster he called for a public vote giving people the chance to choose between a range of options on what the uk s future relationship with the eu should be this is a moment of profound national crisis for the uk said the billionaire who was revealed in  to be helping fund a group fighting to stop brexit prioritising party over country the prime minister is no longer acting in the national interest instead she has decided to pitch herself as the defender of the people against the machinations of parliament branson wrote by limiting the mps choice yet again to one between her own deal and no deal at all she is placing a dangerous bet branson who is worth  bn thanks to his investments in air rail finance and leisure said preparations for brexit and the uncertainty around what form it would take had already cost the economy billions thousands of jobs in britain have been lost already with many more redundancies on the horizon as manufacturers react to the looming threat of tariffs and supply chain disruptions he said more than a trillion pounds in assets are being moved to dublin frankfurt paris and other european cities as financial institutions begin to execute their contingency plans and brexit preparations alone have eaten up billions that could have been spent elsewhere these consequences are real and tangible they affect people everywhere across the uk they affect investment in the uk the nation s ability to trade goods and services to travel to jointly tackle global challenges from climate change to terrorism he said the british electorate should be given a final say on brexit with all options left on the table because their views might have changed since the referendum branson said if people were not given a final say the government should revoke article  and restart the brexit process there is little time to avoid a multi generational disaster he concluded ,Brexit,0.197468281
3547,"A work-to-rule strike by French customs officers warning they are not ready for Brexit is likely to stretch into next week and cause further chaos on Eurostar trains and channel ports.At Gare du Nord in Paris on Wednesday, hundreds of passengers queued in lines stretching the full length of the station, with an estimated six-hour wait for trains to the UK. Eurostar has encouraged people not to travel at all between Paris and London this week if they could avoid it.French customs officers are into their third week of industrial action over long-running anger at working conditions, saying a lack of preparation for a no-deal Brexit was the final straw.Instead of walking off the job, customs officers are diligently carrying out longer and more rigorous checks than usual, to demonstrate what might happen if full border controls are put in place after Brexit, particularly in the case of no deal.Union leaders said customs officers at the Eurostar terminal were simply asking two or three extra questions of passengers – which was causing acute delays and train cancellations.When the action began at Calais and Dunkirk ports on 4 March, customs officers simply carried out vehicle checks and requested registration documents, resulting in two weeks of lengthy tailbacks for trucks waiting to cross to Britain. Unions warned the disturbance caused by rigorous checks was a taste of post-Brexit reality.Vincent Thomazo, secretary general of the customs branch of the Unsa union, told the Guardian: “This strike is over long-running concerns over our general working conditions, but Brexit was the final straw. We believe that contingency plans here for Brexit are low-cost, with not enough extra customs officers. Brexit has highlighted a sense of angst that had been there for years.”Of a no-deal Brexit, Thomazo said: “We are absolutely not ready – no one is. Everyone is in denial.”The French government insists it is ready for a no-deal Brexit, with the recruitment of an extra 700 customs officials. Unions say more are needed.Last week French unions representing around 17,000 customs workers rejected a government offer of a €14m payroll boost, saying it was insufficient. No new talks are scheduled, and the joint industrial action by all unions is open-ended.In the Eurostar queue at Gare du Nord, Ashley Barnes and Zach Mance from Portland, Oregon, were bracing for a six-hour wait. The US couple had deliberately booked their honeymoon trip between Amsterdam, Paris and London before the Brexit exit date of 29 March to avoid travel chaos.“We thought since we’d be there before Brexit, it would be fine,” said Barnes. Mance, who works for a small winery in the US, had – like many in the queue – brought a bottle of wine to share for the wait.Keith Howell from Essex, who used to work in banking, and Helen Aslett, who works for a small firm in Braintree, had worried more about the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protest in Paris when booking their trip. They had rushed to visit Montmartre and the Moulin Rouge in the morning before dedicating almost a full day to queuing. They had voted to remain in the Brexit referendum. “I didn’t think we had enough information or knowledge to vote leave,” Howell said. “But we had been told an exit would be orderly, instead there is complete uncertainty.”“Even more reason to get away from France!” said Nick, 64, a retired healthworker from Essex. He had voted to leave the EU but feared if Brexit was postponed it might never happen. His partner, celebrating her birthday with a three-day trip to Paris, had voted remain, “because I feared that leaving would be a mess”.

3570,"Two hundred coaches have been booked to take people to London for a People’s Vote march, which organisers said would exceed the size of last October’s rally, when it was claimed 700,000 turned up.James McGrory, the director of the People’s Vote campaign, said it was the “biggest mass movement in the country” and hundreds of thousands were expected to join the march from Park Lane to Parliament Square.The campaign group claimed the number of coaches booked was more than double the number in October, although the exact figure is understood to be slightly less as 105 coaches brought people to the capital last autumn.Details emerged at a People’s Vote event aimed largely at foreign journalists, where the campaign admitted that despite the preparations for the weekend, there was still no immediate prospect of MPs voting for a second referendum.Protesters would come from places that voted heavily to leave the EU, McGrory said, including from Chesterfield, Doncaster, Lincoln and Peterborough. A coach from the Scottish Highlands will leave on Friday evening, and another from Penzance in Cornwall will leave at 3.15am.The claim of 700,000 attendees in October made it the second largest march in the UK this century, after the 2003 Stop the War demonstration, although other estimates suggested the figure was about 450,000.McGrory and other People’s Vote insiders declined to predict how many would turn up on Saturday, warning the weather would be a determining factor, but the numbers of people pre-registering on the campaign website were “significantly higher” than before.Alastair Campbell, the former Labour press chief and People’s Vote campaigner, conceded that despite the current Brexit crisis, “if there was a vote [in the Commons] tomorrow on a people’s vote it would not win”.Last week, when a second referendum was put before the Commons it was voted down 334 to 85, with the majority of the Labour party abstaining and the People’s Vote campaign arguing it was not the right time to press the issue to the vote.Campbell said the decision to abstain was a “tactical judgment”, reflecting the fact the proposal was not likely to pass even with Labour support.The march is due to begin at noon at the north end of Park Lane near Marble Arch and end at Parliament Square, with speeches from 2.45pm. Speakers from all parties are due to be announced shortly. There will be an additional relay to large screens in Trafalgar Square to help spread out the crowds.The leftwing anti-Brexit group Another Europe is Possible is holding a rally just before the march on Saturday, asking people to assemble at 11am at Stanhope Gate in central London. It will begin with speeches from Labour MPs including Clive Lewis, Kate Osamor and Lloyd-Russell Moyle as well the Green party joint leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley.The campaign also released YouGov polling that showed, according to Peter Kellner, a former president of the data company, that British public opinion was “polarising around Brexit”. The research said a referendum between staying in the EU and May’s Brexit deal would see remain win 60% to 40% – and that remain would defeat no deal by 56% to 44%.But it also showed that the public believed that a no-deal Brexit would honour the result of the 2016 referendum by 46% to 31%, and that softer Brexit deals in which the UK still followed EU rules and regulations would not honour the result by 68% to 11%.A slight majority of the public, 52%, wanted Brexit delayed, while 35% said the UK should leave next week come what may. But only 10% said a delay should be used to give May’s Brexit deal more time to pass; others said it should be used to negotiate a soft Brexit, hold a general election or have a second referendum.","People's Vote march: 200 coaches heading to London, organisers say",2019-03-20/13:37:51+0000,two hundred coaches have been booked to take people to london for a people s vote march which organisers said would exceed the size of last october s rally when it was claimed   turned up james mcgrory the director of the people s vote campaign said it was the biggest mass movement in the country and hundreds of thousands were expected to join the march from park lane to parliament square the campaign group claimed the number of coaches booked was more than double the number in october although the exact figure is understood to be slightly less as  coaches brought people to the capital last autumn details emerged at a people s vote event aimed largely at foreign journalists where the campaign admitted that despite the preparations for the weekend there was still no immediate prospect of mps voting for a second referendum protesters would come from places that voted heavily to leave the eu mcgrory said including from chesterfield doncaster lincoln and peterborough a coach from the scottish highlands will leave on friday evening and another from penzance in cornwall will leave at  am the claim of   attendees in october made it the second largest march in the uk this century after the  stop the war demonstration although other estimates suggested the figure was about   mcgrory and other people s vote insiders declined to predict how many would turn up on saturday warning the weather would be a determining factor but the numbers of people pre registering on the campaign website were significantly higher than before alastair campbell the former labour press chief and people s vote campaigner conceded that despite the current brexit crisis if there was a vote in the commons tomorrow on a people s vote it would not win last week when a second referendum was put before the commons it was voted down  to  with the majority of the labour party abstaining and the people s vote campaign arguing it was not the right time to press the issue to the vote campbell said the decision to abstain was a tactical judgment reflecting the fact the proposal was not likely to pass even with labour support the march is due to begin at noon at the north end of park lane near marble arch and end at parliament square with speeches from  pm speakers from all parties are due to be announced shortly there will be an additional relay to large screens in trafalgar square to help spread out the crowds the leftwing anti brexit group another europe is possible is holding a rally just before the march on saturday asking people to assemble at am at stanhope gate in central london it will begin with speeches from labour mps including clive lewis kate osamor and lloyd russell moyle as well the green party joint leaders sian berry and jonathan bartley the campaign also released yougov polling that showed according to peter kellner a former president of the data company that british public opinion was polarising around brexit the research said a referendum between staying in the eu and may s brexit deal would see remain win  to  and that remain would defeat no deal by  to  but it also showed that the public believed that a no deal brexit would honour the result of the  referendum by  to  and that softer brexit deals in which the uk still followed eu rules and regulations would not honour the result by  to  a slight majority of the public  wanted brexit delayed while  said the uk should leave next week come what may but only  said a delay should be used to give may s brexit deal more time to pass others said it should be used to negotiate a soft brexit hold a general election or have a second referendum ,Brexit,0.183772489
3702,"Dublin port is putting the finishing touches to new customs booths and freight inspection points in preparation for Brexit, but there will not be any ribbon-cutting ceremony when – or if – they open.“Bloody border posts. It’s a waste of money, a waste of time and a waste of space,” said the port company’s chief executive, Eamonn O’Reilly, as he toured the docks recently.New infrastructure is usually a source of pride here, a sign that the gateway to Ireland’s economy is expanding, but O’Reilly winced at the sight of the parking bays, canopies and warehouse earmarked for trucks from Britain.“It’s a complete pain in the ...” – he fished for a diplomatic word – “in the port”.The port has spent €30m (£25.5m) and set aside 7.8 hectares (19 acres) in preparation for Britain crashing out of the EU on 29 March, a day that now looks set to be delayed or even cancelled, leaving the border posts idle or redundant. Yet O’Reilly felt compelled to prepare, just in case.“I’ve given up trying to double-guess what might happen. What happens day by day in Westminster is just extraordinary.”Should Theresa May squeak her deal through parliament in her third attempt this week, the state-owned port’s border posts may end up as 21st-century versions of the Martello towers, a chain of small forts around Dublin Bay built to repel a Napoleonic invasion that never came.Should no deal materialise, the port’s preparations will face a mammoth test that will shape Ireland’s post-Brexit fate.Almost 90% of Ireland’s road freight traffic passes through the port, an economic chokepoint that has been overshadowed by focus on the backstop and border with Northern Ireland.Food, medicine, clothes, machinery, horses and other goods and livestock come via Holyhead in north Wales, Liverpool and Heysham in Lancashire. The equivalent of 13km |(eight miles) of trucks and containers is offloaded in less than an hour before dawn, one of four “waves” of vessels that dock daily, said O’Reilly. “A line of steel just pouring off the ships.”About 200,000 of the 1.3m containers that enter the port each year originate outside the EU and require customs checks. Should the UK crash out, that 200,000 will rise to 1m – requiring a significant diversion of resources for a port that is growing fast and utilises land, in terms of tonnes per hectare, almost twice as intensively as Rotterdam.Hundreds of newly recruited or assigned revenue officers, gardai, customs inspectors, vets and other officials are on standby, part of the Irish government’s attempt to “Brexit-proof” the economy.“I’m old enough to remember when customs posts were taken down,” said O’Reilly, a reference to the early 1990s when the EU single market was created.Brexit has renewed his appreciation for that “massive achievement”, a frictionless wonder facilitated by the EU handling trade rules and myriad red tape. “Air travel, roaming charges, environmental standards – we take it for granted.”O’Reilly, who has hosted British and Irish ministers at the port, is confident that under no deal goods would keep flowing, albeit more slowly. “Dublin port will have the infrastructure ready. I don’t think state services will be fully manned up. It’s unreasonable to expect that Ireland or any country would be completely manned up at the outset.” Staffing would expand as needed, he said.Asked if he was personally stockpiling anything, he shook his head. Not all share O’Reilly’s confidence.John McGrane, the director general of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, speaking on the sidelines of a Brexit conference at the National University of Ireland in Galway, predicted significant delays for ships and trucks and disruption of supply chains.“It’s a fantasy to think that in a hard Brexit context what the ports are doing will be adequate to avoid disruption,” he said. McGrane worried especially about the import of raw materials and the fate of mid-sized agri-food companies.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has warned Ireland that no country can be fully prepared for no deal. “It is uncharted territory. No country has ever left the EU before.”Some Brexiters reportedly hoped the prospect of gridlock and disruption in Dublin and elsewhere would prompt Irish businesses to pressure Varadkar to compromise on the backstop, the insurance policy to avert a hard border with Northern Ireland that has bedevilled the Brexit deal.That has not happened. There is consensus in Ireland that the government must stay firm on the backstop.Westminster’s febrile mood was all the more reason to have insurance, said O’Reilly. “We love England. But love and trust are two different things.”",'A waste of money': Dublin port reluctantly prepares for Brexit,2019-03-17/13:55:52+0000,dublin port is putting the finishing touches to new customs booths and freight inspection points in preparation for brexit but there will not be any ribbon cutting ceremony when or if they open bloody border posts it s a waste of money a waste of time and a waste of space said the port company s chief executive eamonn o reilly as he toured the docks recently new infrastructure is usually a source of pride here a sign that the gateway to ireland s economy is expanding but o reilly winced at the sight of the parking bays canopies and warehouse earmarked for trucks from britain it s a complete pain in the he fished for a diplomatic word in the port the port has spent m  m and set aside   hectares  acres in preparation for britain crashing out of the eu on  march a day that now looks set to be delayed or even cancelled leaving the border posts idle or redundant yet o reilly felt compelled to prepare just in case i ve given up trying to double guess what might happen what happens day by day in westminster is just extraordinary should theresa may squeak her deal through parliament in her third attempt this week the state owned port s border posts may end up as st century versions of the martello towers a chain of small forts around dublin bay built to repel a napoleonic invasion that never came should no deal materialise the port s preparations will face a mammoth test that will shape ireland s post brexit fate almost  of ireland s road freight traffic passes through the port an economic chokepoint that has been overshadowed by focus on the backstop and border with northern ireland food medicine clothes machinery horses and other goods and livestock come via holyhead in north wales liverpool and heysham in lancashire the equivalent of km eight miles of trucks and containers is offloaded in less than an hour before dawn one of four waves of vessels that dock daily said o reilly a line of steel just pouring off the ships about   of the  m containers that enter the port each year originate outside the eu and require customs checks should the uk crash out that   will rise to m requiring a significant diversion of resources for a port that is growing fast and utilises land in terms of tonnes per hectare almost twice as intensively as rotterdam hundreds of newly recruited or assigned revenue officers gardai customs inspectors vets and other officials are on standby part of the irish government s attempt to brexit proof the economy i m old enough to remember when customs posts were taken down said o reilly a reference to the early s when the eu single market was created brexit has renewed his appreciation for that massive achievement a frictionless wonder facilitated by the eu handling trade rules and myriad red tape air travel roaming charges environmental standards we take it for granted o reilly who has hosted british and irish ministers at the port is confident that under no deal goods would keep flowing albeit more slowly dublin port will have the infrastructure ready i don t think state services will be fully manned up it s unreasonable to expect that ireland or any country would be completely manned up at the outset staffing would expand as needed he said asked if he was personally stockpiling anything he shook his head not all share o reilly s confidence john mcgrane the director general of the british irish chamber of commerce speaking on the sidelines of a brexit conference at the national university of ireland in galway predicted significant delays for ships and trucks and disruption of supply chains it s a fantasy to think that in a hard brexit context what the ports are doing will be adequate to avoid disruption he said mcgrane worried especially about the import of raw materials and the fate of mid sized agri food companies the taoiseach leo varadkar has warned ireland that no country can be fully prepared for no deal it is uncharted territory no country has ever left the eu before some brexiters reportedly hoped the prospect of gridlock and disruption in dublin and elsewhere would prompt irish businesses to pressure varadkar to compromise on the backstop the insurance policy to avert a hard border with northern ireland that has bedevilled the brexit deal that has not happened there is consensus in ireland that the government must stay firm on the backstop westminster s febrile mood was all the more reason to have insurance said o reilly we love england but love and trust are two different things ,Brexit,0.230062306
3777,"Ireland will want to avoid a series of “rolling cliff edges” if the UK requests a delay to its exit from the EU, the country’s finance minister has said.Paschal Donohoe said London would need to convince the EU27 that an extension to article 50 would not further risk economic disruption.“I believe it is highly important that we do all we can to avoid being in a scenario of rolling cliff edges … particularly from a financial market stability perspective and economic stability, we need to be aware of that,” he said.Theresa May is expected to ask the EU for an extension next week at the European council summit after MPs voted overwhelming to delay Brexit until 30 June.Donohoe said the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, had made it clear that Ireland would “provide a generous response” but that London needed to spell out what it wanted from any extension.A delay of anything from a few months to as long as 21 months has been mooted in recent weeks, with some EU leaders such as the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, questioning the point of any extension if the UK was not clear about the kind of Brexit it wanted.Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, is among those who have

is really important to us and to the European Union is that … we are all clear what that extension period is for and that the availability of that extension period doesn’t in any way heighten the kind of economic risk that we are trying to avoid at the moment.”He said Ireland was still hopeful a deal could be achieved before 29 March as originally envisaged. “The few days that are now approaching

3840,"Senior Tory Eurosceptics believe they and the Democratic Unionist party could be persuaded to back Theresa May’s Brexit deal if Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, gave clearer legal advice about how the UK could withdraw from an international treaty.It is understood the DUP is back in talks with senior government figures about what it would take for them to back May’s deal at a third Commons vote. A party source said: “Channels are open.”The majority of Eurosceptic MPs from the European Research Group (ERG) voted against May’s revised deal, defeating it for a second time, because Cox advised there was only a “reduced risk” that the UK could be trapped indefinitely in the Northern Ireland backstop and therefore a customs union with the EU.However, discussions are taking place around a point that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG chair, raised in the House of Commons before Tuesday’s vote, relating to “how article 62 of the Vienna convention could be used”.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, replied that the UK would have the ability to terminate the withdrawal agreement “if the facts clearly warranted that there had been an unforeseen and fundamental change of circumstances affecting the essential basis of the treaty on which the United Kingdom’s consent had been given”.He added: “It would, in the government’s view, be clear in those exceptional circumstances that international law provides the United Kingdom with a right to terminate the withdrawal agreement. In the unlikely event that that were to happen, the United Kingdom would no doubt offer to continue to observe the unexhausted obligations in connection, for example, with citizens’ rights.”An ERG source said this had been written by Cox but had not made it into the final legal advice. “If we’d had it earlier in the day it could have changed the vote,” the source said.He said not everyone in the ERG had the potential to be convinced, but many still wanted to back an improved deal rather than leave on no-deal terms. If there was some more momentum in favour of a deal, a few more Labour MPs could potentially be convinced.No 10 is still holding out hope of getting the deal passed through the Commons on a third or even fourth attempt.Earlier on Wednesday, Steve Baker, the ERG’s chief organiser, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the group had been “really yearning” to vote for a deal but Cox’s bombshell legal advice on the Northern Ireland backstop meant that was impossible.Rees-Mogg also did not rule out changing his mind on the deal in future.Speaking to the Guardian’s Today in Focus podcast, due out on Friday, Rees-Mogg said: “I think leaving without a deal is better than the prime minister’s deal as it is currently announced, though I would have preferred a deal had that proved possible and if this deal could be made more palatable I would still prefer a deal to no deal. It is not a cunning plan to get us to no deal by default.”Asked whether he would vote for the deal if the DUP were happy with it, he said: “Yes. I am a unionist but it is difficult for me to be more unionist than the DUP and if they are happy with the way of getting out of the backstop and that is good enough for Northern Ireland then I expect it would be good enough for some of us.”Asked whether he would vote for May’s deal on 28 March if it was a choice between that and losing Brexit, Rees-Mogg said: “In the words of the deceased prime minister Lord Oxford and Asquith, wait and see.”",ERG signals it could back May's Brexit deal if legal advice is clearer,2019-03-13/18:39:43+0000,senior tory eurosceptics believe they and the democratic unionist party could be persuaded to back theresa may s brexit deal if geoffrey cox the attorney general gave clearer legal advice about how the uk could withdraw from an international treaty it is understood the dup is back in talks with senior government figures about what it would take for them to back may s deal at a third commons vote a party source said channels are open the majority of eurosceptic mps from the european research group erg voted against may s revised deal defeating it for a second time because cox advised there was only a reduced risk that the uk could be trapped indefinitely in the northern ireland backstop and therefore a customs union with the eu however discussions are taking place around a point that jacob rees mogg the erg chair raised in the house of commons before tuesday s vote relating to how article  of the vienna convention could be used stephen barclay the brexit secretary replied that the uk would have the ability to terminate the withdrawal agreement if the facts clearly warranted that there had been an unforeseen and fundamental change of circumstances affecting the essential basis of the treaty on which the united kingdom s consent had been given he added it would in the government s view be clear in those exceptional circumstances that international law provides the united kingdom with a right to terminate the withdrawal agreement in the unlikely event that that were to happen the united kingdom would no doubt offer to continue to observe the unexhausted obligations in connection for example with citizens rights an erg source said this had been written by cox but had not made it into the final legal advice if we d had it earlier in the day it could have changed the vote the source said he said not everyone in the erg had the potential to be convinced but many still wanted to back an improved deal rather than leave on no deal terms if there was some more momentum in favour of a deal a few more labour mps could potentially be convinced no  is still holding out hope of getting the deal passed through the commons on a third or even fourth attempt earlier on wednesday steve baker the erg s chief organiser told bbc radio  s today programme that the group had been really yearning to vote for a deal but cox s bombshell legal advice on the northern ireland backstop meant that was impossible rees mogg also did not rule out changing his mind on the deal in future speaking to the guardian s today in focus podcast due out on friday rees mogg said i think leaving without a deal is better than the prime minister s deal as it is currently announced though i would have preferred a deal had that proved possible and if this deal could be made more palatable i would still prefer a deal to no deal it is not a cunning plan to get us to no deal by default asked whether he would vote for the deal if the dup were happy with it he said yes i am a unionist but it is difficult for me to be more unionist than the dup and if they are happy with the way of getting out of the backstop and that is good enough for northern ireland then i expect it would be good enough for some of us asked whether he would vote for may s deal on  march if it was a choice between that and losing brexit rees mogg said in the words of the deceased prime minister lord oxford and asquith wait and see ,Brexit,0.317498833
3884,"Ministers have voiced concern that already stretched police resources will be diverted from Britain’s cities to help contend with any traffic and transport problems arising in Kent from a no-deal Brexit affecting the Channel ports.The plans form part of Operation Snow Bunting, which aims to coordinate the policing response to Brexit, but Whitehall sources said there was unhappiness in cabinet with the idea of diverting so many officers to the county.“I can’t believe we are planning to take officers off the street at a time knife crime is rising,” one cabinet source said, arguing that the public will start to understand the impact of a no-deal Brexit as the government finally spells out its plans.On Wednesday morning, the government will say what tariffs it will levy on food and goods, and how it will ensure the Northern Ireland border remains open – plans that had been deemed so sensitive that they had been kept secret until now.Theresa May told MPs after being defeated on her Brexit deal for a second time that ministers would publish “essential policies which would need to be put in place if we were to leave without a deal” before Wednesday’s Commons vote on allowing a no-deal Brexit on 29 March.The prime minister said Conservative MPs would be given a free vote on the issue to head off a string of frontbench resignations. Cabinet members are expected to be split, with Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd and Greg Clark opposed to no deal and Liam Fox, Chris Grayling and Penny Mordaunt among those who could be in favour.Kent police confirmed that they had requested more officers in the event of no deal, using an existing mutual aid system, but the force would not say how many officers it would need to ensure traffic kept moving.Kent county council has drawn up plans to park 5,000 lorries on one lane of the M20, nearby dual carriageways and a further 6,000 at Manston airport if there are delays at the Channel ports.But Paul Carter, the council’s Conservative leader, conceded the authority had not yet resolved how to handle tourist traffic via the Channel tunnel if disruption were to occur, and added that the UK would be heavily reliant on the response of the French.“The authorities have promised that Calais will run smoothly and we hope it will, but there were long delays last week when there was a go-slow when they protested about a lack of resources to handle Brexit,” Carter said.May herself is expected to support ruling out a no-deal exit on 29 March. Referring to Northern Ireland, she said she was conscious of “the potential damage to the union that leaving without a deal could do when one part of our country is without devolved governance”.Neither Dublin, London nor the EU have published their no-deal plans for Northern Ireland because they have been deemed so sensitive.Any warnings over the prospect of a renewal of violence or civil disobedience will be designed to concentrate the minds of the Democratic Unionist party and the Brexiters who voted against May’s deal.Last month George Hamilton, the head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, warned that border posts and security installations created as a result of a hard Brexit would be seen as “fair game” for attack by dissident republicans.Hamilton also expressed concern that the disappearance of the European arrest warrant would mean fugitives could disappear across the border into the republic of Ireland with impunity.In an interview with the Guardian last month, Hamilton described as “severe” the violent threat from the New IRA and other terrorist groups opposed to the peace settlement. A group calling itself the IRA claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent to British targets last week.Tariff schedules will have serious implications for businesses and farming in Northern Ireland which operate an all-island supply chain, forcing crippling costs on them.The Home Office said: “The government is making preparations for all eventualities, including a no deal.

3934,"The claims that British trade with the Commonwealth can make up for leaving the EU is “the nuttiest of the many nutty arguments” advanced by Brexit supporters and “utter bollocks”, the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd has said.In a lacerating piece for the Guardian, Rudd dismissed the claims by some Brexit supporters that the UK could strike deals with his country, New Zealand, Canada and India to soften the blow and said the UK risked undermining western values by leaving the EU in a weaker position when it left.“I’m struck, as the British parliament moves towards the endgame on Brexit, with the number of times Australia, Canada, New Zealand and India have been advanced by the Brexiteers in the public debate as magical alternatives to Britain’s current trade and investment relationship with the European Union,” he wrote.“This is the nuttiest of the many nutty arguments that have emerged from the Land of Hope and Glory set now masquerading as the authentic standard-bearers of British patriotism. It’s utter bollocks.”Of the prospect of a free trade deal with Delhi, he writes: “As for India, good luck!”Rudd, a former chair of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, noted that, while Australia, Canada and New Zealand would remain supportive of a post-Brexit UK, their combined population of about 65 million people does not “come within a bull’s roar of Britain’s adjacent market of 450 million Europeans”.And he cast serious doubt on suggestions the UK could quickly come to a free trade agreement (FTA) with India, pointing out that talks he began with the nation on behalf of Australia a decade ago are still going on. “A substantive India-UK FTA is the ultimate mirage constructed by the Brexiteers. It’s as credible as the ad they plastered on the side of that big red bus about the £350m Britain was allegedly paying to Brussels each week. Not.”Rudd was writing as the British prime minister, Theresa May, made a last-ditch dash to Strasbourg in an effort to negotiate a form of Brexit she could get past MPs, who have overwhelmingly rejected her approach in the Commons. The government has indicated that it intends to honour its commitment to hold a meaningful vote on her Brexit deal on Tuesday, with less than three weeks remaining before the nation leaves the EU.Rudd, who was Australian prime minister from 2007 to 2010 and again for a short spell in 2013, urged the UK to “use this critical fortnight to start turning all this around”.He argued that there was a reason to do so “beyond Britain’s own demonstrable economic self-interest”, claiming that a weaker Europe – alongside a more inward-looking US – could only lead to a weakening of the “continuing idea of ‘the west’”.“If the American pillar is looking a little shaky, Europe is looking even shakier. The strength of the political emergence of the far right across Europe’s four largest countries and economies – Germany, France, Italy and Spain – is frightening.

3974,"Theresa May was battling on Sunday night to save her Brexit deal and prolong her premiership, amid signs Eurosceptics could move against her if there is a delay to leaving the EU.The prime minister’s position looked precarious as she was unable to announce any progress in talks with the EU less than 48 hours before her House of Commons vote on the deal.One Downing Street insider said the week ahead looked “choppy” as parliament is likely to vote to extend article 50 and rule out a no-deal Brexit if MPs do not approve May’s withdrawal agreement with the EU.Two former cabinet ministers – Nicky Morgan and Dominic Raab – suggested that her premiership would be in trouble in that scenario, with speculation that Eurosceptics will try to force her out.To avoid that threat, May will need votes in the week ahead from about 100 Tory and Democratic Unionist party Eurosceptics, who want an assurance that the UK will not indefinitely be bound by the Irish backstop and a permanent customs union with the EU.In a last-ditch effort to win over the rebels, ministers were discussing whether the prime minister could even offer to name a departure date if it would help the deal to pass, while Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was preparing to offer billions to “end austerity” in the spring statement.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, also warned Eurosceptics that failing to back May’s deal meant there was “a risk and a possibility that we end up losing Brexit in the next couple of weeks”.But hardline pro-Brexit supporters were holding their nerve and insisting they would still only consider backing a deal if Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has changed his mind about the permanent nature of the backstop.Steve Baker, a leading figure in the European Research Group, said: “I am clear a change of prime minister would not create an escape from the backstop unless the new prime minister were willing and able to breach international law. And that is absolutely not who we are as a fair-dealing UK.”To those warning of a threat to Brexit, he said: “The people who would stop Brexit should know just this: what you do, you’ll have to do in public now. Stopping Brexit will be on you, not Brexiteers. Don’t kid yourselves otherwise.”David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, also said an offer by May to resign “would not be enough” and warned that a delay to leaving the EU could cause a backlash amounting to a “Trump moment” among the public. Many Eurosceptics will oppose a delay not just over fears it could lead to a second referendum but also the likelihood that the EU would increase the UK’s exit bill by billions of pounds. May was also facing difficulty securing enough Labour votes to get the deal through, despite attempting to woo them with a package of guarantees on workers’ rights and cash for towns across the UK.If May fears she is heading for a heavy defeat she may pull the vote on her deal and instead hold an indicative vote to show the EU what parliament would accept before attempting another negotiation, but there is no certainty that Brussels would be open to more talks without a change in direction towards a softer Brexit. In an article for the Guardian, Sam Gyimah, a Conservative who resigned as a minister to back a people’s vote, warned his colleagues across the parties against voting for the deal under government pressure, suggesting bad policy decisions such as the Iraq war were made under similar circumstances.“The framing of the choice is similar to the one MPs were presented with in the run-up to the Iraq war: military action against Saddam Hussein, or the risk of an attack on this country,” he said.“The prime minister’s version is a similarly artificial choice: her deal, or a chaotic and disorderly exit from the EU that we know will have severe consequences for our communities. MPs are effectively being asked to choose between the frying pan and the fire, in the hope they will choose the former and that will somehow be declared as a victory.”The prime minister was poised to fly to Brussels in the early hours of Monday if there were signs of a breakthrough but she was still undecided late on Sunday night about whether to make a last-minute dash. She was also wavering over whether to make a statement on the issue in the Commons on Monday.If May fails to pass her deal, Labour said it was open to working with other parties to secure a better Brexit deal involving a customs union. But the prospect of parliament seizing control of the negotiations has heightened the chance of Tory Eurosceptics attempting to replace May.His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt’s attempts to talk up a backstory as an 'underestimated' entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse.Overall, Hunt’s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the 'Theresa in trousers' nickname among some Tory MPs – one that is more catchy than accurate (since May herself often wears trousers).In the final round of MP voting Hunt edged out Michael Gove, 77 votes to 75.Johnson’s progress to Downing Street appeared unstoppable even before an overwhelming victory in the first round of voting among MPs. Most of his colleagues believe it is now all but inevitable that he will be Britain’s next prime minister.His well-disciplined campaign team will continue with their strategy of subjecting him to minimal media exposure, though once the field is narrowed down to two, the final pair will appear in more than a dozen head-to-head hustings for Tory members. The team’s main aim is simply to keep heads down and avoid Johnson creating headlines for the wrong reasons. It may not have worked. Johnson came first in the final round of MP voting with 160 votes.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary who is tipped to run for leader and already has a grassroots supporters group called Ready for Raab, told Sky News: “She has said she is going to step down. I would like to see her able to do that in a way of her own choosing. But the government has found itself in a precarious situation and, particularly if the government extends article 50 or tries to reverse the Brexit promises that we have made, I think that situation will get even trickier.”Morgan, the former education secretary, also told the BBC’s The World This Weekend that it would be the “beginning of the end” for May’s policy if the Commons again votes down her deal and then votes against a no-deal Brexit and for an extension of article 50.“I think that her position is going to become slowly less and less tenable as parliament changes the government’s Brexit policy,” she said. “If the votes go this week in a way which means that the prime minister’s policy as she has set out and stuck to rigidly over the course of the last two-and-a-bit years is taken away, dismantled slowly by parliament this week, I think it would be very difficult for the prime minister to stay in office for very much longer.”She suggested the cabinet would have to “take a role in saying potentially to the prime minister, ‘Actually, things have changed significantly.

3980,"The shadow chancellor has said Labour would back a delay to Brexit to help secure a better withdrawal deal, as the party retreated from supporting a parliamentary vote on a second referendum this week.John McDonnell said it was no longer the right time to vote on a second referendum on Tuesday, because the priority should be defeating May’s Brexit and then trying to help negotiate a better one.He had previously said Labour would either put forward an amendment calling for a second referendum or support a backbench one at the time May put her Brexit deal to a vote on 12 March.His comments will disappoint some in the party who want Labour to have a clear position in favour of a second referendum as the top priority. Senior figures in the People’s Vote campaign, however, believe there is not yet enough support in parliament for a second referendum. Alastair Campbell said this would only happen when “it becomes clear there is not a majority for any specific form of Brexit”.McDonnell suggested Labour would back an extension to article 50 to give time to seek a better deal when that option is put to a vote on Thursday. He said the party could help to secure such agreement involving a customs union within weeks, but that article 50 should be extended as long as was necessary to strike a deal.He said it was still Labour’s policy to support a second referendum, but only if parliament proved unable to agree on a better outcome than May’s withdrawal agreement.He told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: “We’ve got to abide by exactly what we’ve said at Labour party conference, which is we go through the sequence of respecting the referendum, preventing a reckless deal that Theresa May is bringing forward, preventing a no deal, looking to see how we can construct a deal which we think could protect jobs and the economy, and failing that going for a general election or failing that going back to the people.“And this week, we thought this would be the week in which Theresa May brought back for a meaningful vote a different deal, a new deal. It doesn’t look like that. It looks as though she’s bringing back the same deal, so I think it will have the same result and it’ll be thrown out. And then we’ll move into a situation where we, at least we can try and vote down a no deal, and then I think, yes, further negotiations will take place.“My view is everything we do this week has got to prevent a no deal and a bad deal. Other discussions will take place but we’ll always, exactly as our party conference said, we’ll always keep on the agenda if necessary. If parliament can’t agree we’ll have to go back to the people. We’ll be forced to.”His position was echoed by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who suggested Labour wanted a straightforward vote on May’s deal on Tuesday. “I think across parliament now people know the deal is the same. There is a strong sense that it should be an up-down vote on the deal,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.“Now that is not just a Labour position. Back on 15 January, when we first went through this exercise, there were lots of amendments down and, in the end, across the house, everybody pretty well pulled their amendments and said we need to know the size of the defeat, if it is a defeat, and we are back to that moment on Tuesday.“That doesn’t mean that the public vote is gone, it doesn’t mean we won’t come to it … Tuesday is about exposing the weakness of the prime minister and then moving on.”Starmer suggested Labour would prefer to back an amendment by backbench MPs than tabling its own, because such a strategy would be more likely to attract support across parliament. He also said Labour’s default position ought to be supporting remain if there were a public vote.Labour wants to throw its weight behind an amendment by Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, two backbench MPs, which would offer a referendum on any deal achieved by the government versus a remain option.The MPs, however, are now not likely to put that amendment to a vote this week given the scale of defeat that May is likely to face on her deal.Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, accused Labour of pulling its punches. “Labour’s apparent belated support for a people’s vote needs to be put to the test very soon. If not Tuesday, when? And their commitment must go hand in hand with a three-line whip,” he said.Scottish Labour’s conference voted earlier on Sunday to support a second referendum on Brexit, reflecting UK Labour policy to “put forward or support an amendment in favour of a public vote, between the option on the one hand of a credible leave deal and on the other hand remain”.","Brexit: Labour would back delay to seek

4035,"Theresa May has urged parliament to “get it done” and back her Brexit deal, in an impassioned speech that offered no new concessions for wavering MPs before next week’s crucial vote.Speaking at a dockside warehouse in the pro-leave town of Grimsby, May repeatedly declined to accept any personal responsibility for the ongoing uncertainty or give any clues as to what she would do if the vote was lost.The speech prompted a withering response from the CBI, whose deputy head said the prime minister’s message was “not good enough”.Addressing workers from Ørsted, a Danish energy and wind turbine firm, May urged the EU to make new concessions over the Irish backstop – the issue that caused many of her MPs to vote against the deal the first time – before expected last-ditch talks in Brussels this weekend.May accused Jeremy Corbyn of trying to frustrate Brexit, and she implored Labour MPs in leave-voting seats, such as Grimsby’s Melanie Onn who attended the event, to back her deal.She said if her plan was voted down again in the Commons on Tuesday, the result would be more economic uncertainty and delay and the possibility of Brexit being either watered down or even overturned.A vote against the deal would mean “not completing Brexit and getting on with all the other important issues people care about, just yet more months and years arguing”, May said. “If we go down that road we might never leave the EU at all.”She added: “My message to those MPs who agree with me that we should not risk that is simple: the only certain way to avoid it is to back the deal the government has secured with EU on Tuesday. Let’s get it done.”The EU “has to make a choice too”, the prime minister said. “We are both participants in this process. It is in the European interest for the UK to leave with a deal. We are working with them but the decisions that the European Union makes over the next few days will have a big impact on the outcome of the vote.“European leaders tell me they worry that time is running out and that we only have one chance to get it right. My message to them is: now is the moment for us to act.”May again talked up her plans on workers’ rights and the redevelopment of towns such as Grimsby, stressing what she said were the benefits of her deal to the fishing industry. However, there was nothing new in policy terms.Asked three times after the speech if she accepted any personal blame, May refused to engage with the issue or say what might happen if the deal was lost again.Asked if she was to blame at all for the lack of certainty just three weeks before the supposed departure date of 29 March, May said: “You mentioned the next few weeks – I would say now is the moment for us to get this done. Now is the moment for parliament to back the deal and to deliver what people voted for.”Asked what might happen with promised votes on no deal or extending the Brexit deadline if her vote was lost, May said: “My focus is on the debate that will take place on Tuesday and getting that vote through.”Asked whether she owed business an apology rather than an explanation for what could happen after Tuesday, May said it was up to MPs to “vote to end that uncertainty”.Joshua Hardie, the deputy director general of the CBI, tweeted: “Businesses are tired of Groundhog Day. If the government deal falls, MPs must avoid no deal and get behind something else, fast. Meanwhile investment and sales will continue to suffer.”A Labour source said of May’s speech: “Is that it? What a waste of everyone’s time. There was nothing new, just more time-wasting and running down the clock. She really is in trouble.”Adding to the sense of disquiet, as May left the venue she faced a shouted question from ITV’s correspondent Libby Wiener as to why, on International Women’s Day, only one female journalist had been selected for a question, and four men. May replied: “You’ve had answers from a woman prime minister.”",'Let's get it done': May urges MPs to back her Brexit deal,2019-03-08/14:17:08+0000,theresa may has urged parliament to get it done and back her brexit deal in an impassioned speech that offered no new concessions for wavering mps before next week s crucial vote speaking at a dockside warehouse in the pro leave town of grimsby may repeatedly declined to accept any personal responsibility for the ongoing uncertainty or give any clues as to what she would do if the vote was lost the speech prompted a withering response from the cbi whose deputy head said the prime minister s message was not good enough addressing workers from ørsted a danish energy and wind turbine firm may urged the eu to make new concessions over the irish backstop the issue that caused many of her mps to vote against the deal the first time before expected last ditch talks in brussels this weekend may accused jeremy corbyn of trying to frustrate brexit and she implored labour mps in leave voting seats such as grimsby s melanie onn who attended the event to back her deal she said if her plan was voted down again in the commons on tuesday the result would be more economic uncertainty and delay and the possibility of brexit being either watered down or even overturned a vote against the deal would mean not completing brexit and getting on with all the other important issues people care about just yet more months and years arguing may said if we go down that road we might never leave the eu at all she added my message to those mps who agree with me that we should not risk that is simple the only certain way to avoid it is to back the deal the government has secured with eu on tuesday let s get it done the eu has to make a choice too the prime minister said we are both participants in this process it is in the european interest for the uk to leave with a deal we are working with them but the decisions that the european union makes over the next few days will have a big impact on the outcome of the vote european leaders tell me they worry that time is running out and that we only have one chance to get it right my message to them is now is the moment for us to act may again talked up her plans on workers rights and the redevelopment of towns such as grimsby stressing what she said were the benefits of her deal to the fishing industry however there was nothing new in policy terms asked three times after the speech if she accepted any personal blame may refused to engage with the issue or say what might happen if the deal was lost again asked if she was to blame at all for the lack of certainty just three weeks before the supposed departure date of  march may said you mentioned the next few weeks i would say now is the moment for us to get this done now is the moment for parliament to back the deal and to deliver what people voted for asked what might happen with promised votes on no deal or extending the brexit deadline if her vote was lost may said my focus is on the debate that will take place on tuesday and getting that vote through asked whether she owed business an apology rather than an explanation for what could happen after tuesday may said it was up to mps to vote to end that uncertainty joshua hardie the deputy director general of the cbi tweeted businesses are tired of groundhog day if the government deal falls mps must avoid no deal and get behind something else fast meanwhile investment and sales will continue to suffer a labour source said of may s speech is that it what a waste of everyone s time there was nothing new just more time wasting and running down the clock she really is in trouble adding to the sense of disquiet as may left the venue she faced a shouted question from itv s correspondent libby wiener as to why on international women s day only one female journalist had been selected for a question and four men may replied you ve had answers from a woman prime minister ,Brexit,0.233211026
4101,"The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has urged hard Brexiters to vote for Theresa May’s withdrawal deal or risk a soft Brexit compromise, even if concessions on the backstop can’t be secured from the EU.Hammond admitted that convincing Brussels to accept legal binding changes to the backstop on the Irish border was proving a “challenge”.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said that even if those assurances could not be secured, he urged the “Brexit wing of the party” to get behind the deal in the crucial meaningful vote next Tuesday or risk uncertainty over Brexit.His warning came after France urged the UK negotiating team, headed by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, to come up with fresh proposals to end the Brexit impasse.Hammond said: “I hope they [Cox and Barclay] will come back with an offer that my colleagues on the Brexit wing of the party will consider very, very carefully in the context of the real situation that we are in, because if the prime minister’s deal does not get approved on Tuesday then it is likely that the House of Commons will vote to extend the article 50 procedure to not leave the EU without a deal, and where we go thereafter is highly uncertain.”He added: “For those people who are passionate about ensuring that we leave the EU on time, it surely must be something that they need to think very carefully about now, because they run the risk of us moving away from their preferred course of action if we don’t get this deal through on Tuesday.”The chancellor said failing to back the deal could involve signing up to a customs union compromise currently being discussed by senior Tory backbenchers and Labour’s leadership.Hammond said: “The Labour party has been talking for a long time about the idea of a customs union grafted onto the PM’s deal. Those of my colleagues who feel very strongly against that proposal need to think very hard about the implications of voting against the prime minister’s deal next Tuesday, because we will then be in unknown territory where a consensus will have to be forged across the House of Commons and that will inevitably mean compromises being made.”He also pointedly refused to say whether he would resign from the government if the prime minister instructed MPs to vote for a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday if her deal was rejected on Tuesday.He said: “I’ve always said that I believe that it would be a very bad outcome for the UK to leave the European Union without a deal, but there isn’t a motion yet … so I can’t say how I will vote on a motion that hasn’t been tabled.”Hammond suggested that the government would not whip MPs to vote for no deal.He said: “I think the government is very clear where the will of parliament is on this.

4119,"Brexit is a “huge help” to Irish republicanism and will fuel violent resistance to British rule in Northern Ireland, a dissident republican leader has claimed.The UK’s departure from the European Union has refocused attention on the border and the “colonialist” partition of Ireland, boosting efforts to politicise a new generation of Irish nationalists, Brian Kenna, chairman of the political party Saoradh, told the Guardian.“Brexit has been a small pilot light in reigniting that side of physical force to British occupation,” he said.Kenna spoke in an interview before three improvised explosive devices were found at separate transport hubs in London on Tuesday. At least two of the packages bore Irish stamps and postmarks.No one has claimed responsibility but, on Wednesday, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, hinted that republican extremists were suspected by expressing “anger and embarrassment” at the “warped thinking” behind the packages.Ireland’s justice minister, Charlie Flanagan, called the parcel-bombing attempt “a sinister act”.An Irish security source said “violent dissident republicans” were the most likely source, pointing to previous letter bomb attacks on targets in Britain and Northern Ireland in 2013 and 2014.Saoradh, which means Liberation in Irish, is a small revolutionary party which rejects the peace process and the Good Friday agreement – and, by extension, Sinn Féin – as tools of partition. The party is believed to share ideology and overlapping membership with the New IRA, a dissident group which claimed responsibility for a car bomb outside a court in Derry in January.Ger Devereux, Saoradh’s general secretary, denied any knowledge of the incendiary packages sent to London, saying the party engaged in legitimate political activism. “Anything that happens outside of that, we have no knowledge of or involvement in,” he said.Speaking on Monday in Dublin, Kenna, 57, the party’s chairman, also distanced Saoradh from the New IRA. But he said a new generation of republicans was committed to using force to achieve a united Ireland.“Every generation going back 800 years, Irish republicans have confronted British occupation. I don’t see any reason why that’s going to stop,” he said.Brexit was giving a boost to resistance, which went through cycles of “highs and lows”, said Kenna.“Brexit is a huge opportunity. It’s not the reason why people would resist British rule but Brexit just gives it focus, gives it a physical picture. It’s a huge help.”Security forces had infiltrated and surveilled republican ranks but resistance would continue and grow, said the chairman. “The republican movement is very adaptable. Necessity is the mother of invention.”The campaign would be smaller than that waged by the Provisional IRA during the Troubles but could still be “impactful” and “very difficult to stop”, he claimed.In the absence of a militarised border or troops on the streets, republican socialist ideology was incentivising recruits, said Kenna. “Young people are now getting involved in an armed campaign without a personal experience of oppression.”The return of customs posts or any border infrastructure would underline the reason for resistance, he said. “That border denies our national sovereignty and partitions our island. Brexit has brought that into focus.”Saoradh, which was formed in 2016, has published a 14-page policy document on Brexit. It considers the UK’s vote to leave the EU a historic opportunity but wants Ireland to also leave, considering the EU a capitalist usurpation of national sovereignty and workers’ rights.Saoradh members appointed Kenna, who has served a prison sentence for IRA membership, at a party conference in the border town of Dundalk last November.Despite the collapse of power-sharing at Stormont in 2017, which has paralysed politics in Northern Ireland, there is little evidence that violent dissidents are filling the vacuum.The New IRA emerged in 2012 via a merger of several groups opposed to the peace process, including the Real IRA. It has been linked with the murder of two prison officers and multiple other attacks.Police chiefs say they are taking the threat seriously but play down dissidents’ capacity for sustained or sophisticated attacks.Marisa McGlinchey, author of the book Unfinished Business, an academic investigation of dissident republicans, said Saoradh reflected the thinking of the New IRA and included prominent former members of the Provisional IRA.“They share an ideology. It’s suspected that there’s an overlap in membership,” she said.Saoradh members had joined other groups in civic campaigns against evictions and water charges but, since the party did not participate in elections, it was difficult to gauge support, said McGlinchey. “They don’t seem realistically to be tapping into wider currents.”Hardline republicans were split between several rival parties, including Republican Sinn Féin, she said. “There seems to be no sign of a cohesive support base. It’s just so divided.”McGlinchey said the incendiary packages sent to London were not necessarily the work of republicans. “If it is, the message is that they’re still here and that they’re still capable of doing it,” she added.","Brexit is a 'huge help' to Irish republicanism, says dissident leader",2019-03-06/19:41:40+0000,brexit is a huge help to irish republicanism and will fuel violent

4246,"Left-behind towns in England are to get a £1.6bn funding boost as part of a package of measures to win support for Theresa May’s Brexit deal among Labour MPs, who said the new cash would not buy their votes.Labour MPs including Lisa Nandy and Gareth Snell who have signalled they might back May’s deal criticised the approach and said the cash would do little to tackle the effects of austerity. The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, denied the money was a Brexit bribe and said it would be enough to have a “transformative” impact on areas that felt left behind.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday, he refused to say how many towns would benefit, but pointed out that the cash would be allocated whatever happens in next week’s meaningful vote on the EU withdrawal bill.“This funding is there regardless of the outcome … there is no conditionality,” he said. “This funding is there to see that towns grow … and we leave no part of our UK left behind.”Brokenshire said the money would be available until 2026, which would equate to as little as £320m per year assuming that the funds take a year to allocate.The prime minister said the Stronger Towns Fund, much of it allocated to the north of England and the Midlands, would go to areas that had not “shared the proceeds of growth”.May, who is also expected to announce post-Brexit guarantees on workers’ and trade union rights in the coming days, said £1bn had been allocated already, of which more than half would go to the north of England, where places such as Wakefield, Doncaster and Wigan voted heavily for Brexit.About £322m will go to towns in the Midlands, where the leave vote in places such as Stoke-on-Trent, Mansfield and Wolverhampton was high. Nandy, the MP for Wigan and a former shadow minister, said towns such as hers had been “shamefully ignored for decades” and the new fund must represent the start of an overhaul in the government’s approach to investment.“If it is a one-off payment designed to help the prime minister ahead of a key Brexit vote, it will fail and confirm to people in our towns that the government is not serious in its commitment to our communities,” she said.Snell, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, one of the MPs who has been negotiating with the government about new guarantees for workers, said the money for his region would not even cover the cuts made by his local council.“Regardless of how much money the prime minister promises communities like the West Midlands, I will make up my mind on how I vote based on the terms of the deal,” he said. “There is no price on my vote. The West Midlands is getting £212m, which is a good starting point to address the problems we are facing but in context, that £212m for the whole region is less than the total amount that Stoke city council has had to cut from its budget in the last nine years because of austerity. So it is not a big windfall that will make everything right.”No 10 said communities would be given some say about how to spend the money in their towns via local enterprise partnerships. The remaining £600m will be available through a bidding process to communities in any part of the country, a sweetener to Conservative MPs who had demanded their areas receive equal treatment.Announcing the fund, May linked the new money directly to the leave votes from the towns it would benefit. “Communities across the country voted for Brexit as an expression of their desire to see change. That must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control,” she said. “These towns have a glorious heritage, huge potential and, with the right help, a bright future ahead of them.”Conservative MPs were disconcerted that the pledge had been linked to securing the votes of Labour MPs. Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow, pushed the prime minister during PMQs last week for reassurance that towns such as his in Essex would be able to make the case for more funding.“I welcome that £600m has been pledged to towns across UK – like Harlow –with significant disadvantage and deprivation,” he said. “It is vital that this fund is not seen as pork-barrel politics, but a way for all poorer communities to benefit post-Brexit.”Brexiter MPs also expressed caution about the cash. Simon Clarke, the Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, who previously voted against May’s deal, said: “What this money won’t do is buy any votes in parliament. I am determined to deliver a proper Brexit, which means fixing the backstop, while all the local Labour MPs are unapologetically in denial about the need to leave the EU at all.”Labour and campaigners for a second referendum dismissed May’s announcement. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the fund “smacks of desperation from a government reduced to bribing MPs to vote for their damaging flagship Brexit legislation”.He said towns were struggling because of “a decade of cuts, including to council funding, and a failure to invest in businesses and our communities”. Labour would establish a network of regional development banks to finance growth in smaller towns, he said. “No Brexit bribery. Stable investment where it’s most needed.”Anna Soubry, part of the breakaway Independent Group, said it was “a desperate measure to buy votes” and compared it with the £1bn the DUP secured for Northern Ireland as part of its confidence and supply agreement.“Now Theresa May is so desperate to get votes for a bad EU withdrawal agreement she is relying on the same old trick,” Soubry said. “Voters will not be fooled, especially those in areas which voted leave and are now demanding a people’s vote because they know whichever way you do it, Brexit will harm their futures.”• This article

4461,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, even more essential reading now that there’s barely a month before B-day. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here.Producing the Guardian’s independent, in-depth journalism takes time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters, and it may be yours too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please support us. Thank you.On and on and on it goes. Sparking a fierce backlash, Theresa May delayed MPs’ next “meaningful” vote on her Brexit deal until 12 March – barely a fortnight before Britain is due to leave the EU (a feat she described as “still within our grasp”).The prime minister also insisted Brexit “must not, will not be blocked”, and dismissed pressure on her to step down after senior government figures told the Guardian she should go once the first phase of Brexit is delivered or face a no-confidence vote in parliament.Faced with yet more can-kicking, an increasingly exasperated EU27 – determined to avoid the uncertainty of repeated three-month extension requests – let it be known it might just prefer delaying Brexit until 2021 while the UK sorts itself out.With the EU unwilling to make the kind of “legally binding changes” to the Irish backstop that Britain wants, the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there was now a high chance of an “accidental” no-deal Brexit.But as the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, seeks to translate the bloc’s earlier assurances over the temporary nature of the backstop into a legal protocol acceptable to hardline Brexiters, Donald Tusk, the EU council president, said the EU would favour an article 50 extension as a “rational solution” if the deal is not ratified soon.May continues to insist she does not want an extension. But up to 25 members of her government, including four cabinet ministers – David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Mundell – are ready to vote for a Brexit delay, while dozens of moderate Conservative MPs are also prepared to vote against the government to avoid no deal.Labour, meanwhile, has finally come off the fence, saying it will back a second vote if parliament rejects a plan it will table this week for a permanent and comprehensive customs union and close alignment with the single market. Jeremy Corbyn said the party would also back the Cooper-Letwin amendment (see below) to avert no deal.With eight Labour MPs having now left the opposition party to form the Independent Group, May was further weakened by the decision of three moderate Conservatives to join them over her Brexit policy. The move by Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen underlines how the PM has now exhausted many of her MPs’ patience.On the good news front, analysts predicted that UK food imports from the EU would face a £9bn tariff bill under a no-deal Brexit, with retailers warning of tariffs of up to 40% being imposed on key foodstuffs if the UK crashes out without an agreement.The final Brexit countdown is now under way. Crucial to it is an amendment due to be tabled this week by the former Labour and Conservative ministers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin. This would instruct May to seek an extension of article 50 if she does not have a deal ratified by 13 March.If the Cooper-Letwin amendment passes and Cox succeeds in coming up with some form of codicil making the non-permanent nature of the backstop solid enough to satisfy the Brexiters, the amended deal – with the alternative being a very long article 50 extension – could conceivably win Commons approval on 13 March.May would then, inevitably, have to ask for a brief extension, maybe two months, to get the withdrawal agreement bill – the full Brexit legislation – through parliament. The EU27 could sign off on the deal at their summit on 21/22 March. And Brexit might then (after a lot of ifs and buts) happen at the beginning of the summer.A lot, though, could still go wrong for May, including mass resignations from the government by members determined to ensure a no-deal Brexit is averted by voting for Cooper-Letwin. And MPs could also, of course, vote for that promised Labour amendment calling for a second referendum.

Why would the British left so blithely enable a Tory project that seeks to cripple it all over again? As Brexit fails to get through parliament, Corbyn should stop pushing for a compromise deal. Instead, Labour should get behind a second referendum. Leave voters would not punish Labour at the next election anywhere near as badly as its remain base: just 36% of Labour leave voters rank Brexit in the top three topics they care about; for Labour remainers, that shoots up to 60%.In the Observer, Will Hutton says Honda’s decision to close its Swindon plant signals the end of a profitable industrial relationship decades in the making:A new Japanese consensus has formed. The Conservative party and its leaders cannot be trusted. They ignore warnings, break their word and do not understand business – personified by Old Etonians Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. Brexit is a first-order disaster, striking at the heart of how Japanese companies organise themselves as “lean manufacturers”. Japanese inward investment mitigated our own failures and is now on its way out. Britain has many more bitter pills to swallow before this whole contemptible business is over.Alexander Clarkson calls it “Escher Brexit”, and you can see why:To recap: The UK is threatening self-harm

4589,"Ireland will no longer recognise the UK driving licences of people living in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The Road Safety Authority of Ireland, a state agency, said this week a mutual recognition agreement would end and that holders of British licences would need to swap them for Irish licences before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March.“In the event of a no-deal Brexit the driving licence of a UK licence holder living here in Ireland will not be recognised and the driver will not be able to continue to drive here in Ireland on that licence,” the National Driver Licence Service, which issues permits, said in a statement.“The advice to such drivers is that they should exchange their UK driving licence for an Irish driving licence before the 29 March 2019. Under current arrangements a UK licence holder resident here in Ireland has an entitlement to make such an exchange.”Under current rules a UK licence holder can swap a licence and preserve the different categories and permissions conferred by their existing permit. It takes about 17 days to process an application. There is a €55 (£48) fee.Under the Brexit deal that Westminster rejected last month, Ireland and other EU countries would continue to recognise UK licences during a transition period.Last month Irish motorists learned that to drive in Northern Ireland and Britain after a no-deal Brexit they will need “green cards” to prove they are insured.The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland has reportedly sent up to 400,000 green cards to insurance companies. Under current rules the EU’s motor insurance directive allows free movement around the bloc without need for such documentation.The Irish government stepped up no-deal preparations on Friday by publishing a Brexit omnibus bill incorporating 16 pieces of legislation designed to help protect Ireland from the shock of the UK crashing out of the EU.Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister, said he hoped the legislation would prove “redundant” and never have to be used. “Simply put, as a result of a lot of hard work, my only desire is to see this legislation sit on the shelf.”",UK driving licences will not be valid in Ireland under no-deal Brexit,2019-02-22/13:26:04+0000,ireland will no longer recognise the uk driving licences of people living in ireland in the event of a no deal brexit the road safety authority of ireland a state agency said this week a mutual recognition agreement would end and that holders of british licences would need to swap them for irish licences before the uk is due to leave the eu on  march in the event of a no deal brexit the driving licence of a uk licence holder living here in ireland will not be recognised and the driver will not be able to continue to drive here in ireland on that licence the national driver licence service which issues permits said in a statement the advice to such drivers is that they should exchange their uk driving licence for an irish driving licence before the  march  under current arrangements a uk licence holder resident here in ireland has an entitlement to make such an exchange under current rules a uk licence holder can swap a licence and preserve the different categories and permissions conferred by their existing permit it takes about  days to process an application there is a   fee under the brexit deal that westminster rejected last month ireland and other eu countries would continue to recognise uk licences during a transition period last month irish motorists learned that to drive in northern ireland and britain after a no deal brexit they will need green cards to prove they are insured the motor insurance bureau of ireland has reportedly sent up to   green cards to insurance companies under current rules the eu s motor insurance directive allows free movement around the bloc without need for such documentation the irish government stepped up no deal preparations on friday by publishing a brexit omnibus bill incorporating  pieces of legislation designed to help protect ireland from the shock of the uk crashing out of the eu simon coveney the deputy prime minister said he hoped the legislation would prove redundant and never have to be used simply put as a result of a lot of hard work my only desire is to see this legislation sit on the shelf ,Brexit,0.284343392
4606,"Ireland is accelerating preparations for a no-deal Brexit amid growing alarm that parts of the Irish economy could face severe disruption and even collapse – and that the UK hopes to leverage that prospect to wring concessions from the European Union.Leo Varadkar’s government is due on Friday to publish a mammoth omnibus bill incorporating 16 pieces of legislation to try to shelter Ireland from the doomsday scenario of the UK crashing out of the EU.The parliamentary marathon in Dublin will begin amid increasingly fraught warnings of a hammer blow to agriculture, food processing, transport and other industries.Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister, told the Dáil on Thursday that the European commission would bail out Ireland’s beef industry in the event of a trade war with Britain. Brussels recognised the sector’s “vulnerability” and would “support and protect” it, he said.Coveney spoke in the wake of reports that Britain envisaged World Trade Organization (WTO) tariffs plus a system of “tariff rate quotas” for some food imports, which would favour big producers such as Brazil at Ireland’s expense.“This would be nothing short of a catastrophe for our beef industry and would have a devastating effect on farmers the length and breadth of this country,” said Lisa Chambers, Brexit spokeswoman for the main opposition party, Fianna Fáil.More than half of Ireland’s annual beef exports are sold in the UK. The Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) estimates WTO tariffs in a no-deal Brexit would cost Ireland’s beef farmers €800m (£695m) per year. A system favouring cheaper imports from Brazil could wipe out Irish beef exports to the UK altogether.“The beef industry is in the front line,” said an IFA spokesman. “If there is a crash-out there has to be comprehensive package of market supports and direct aid to cover the losses.”The food major Kerry Group disclosed this week that it was stockpiling raw materials, while British and Irish retail organisations issued a joint warning about tariffs of 40% on food driving up prices for consumers.Some suspect the UK government is intentionally raising the stakes for Ireland in hope that Dublin will soften its insistence on the Irish backstop and let the EU agree a compromise Brexit deal that Theresa May can bring to Westminster.“The British plan ... echoes tactics used against the government of Éamon de Valera during the Anglo-Irish trade war of the 1930s,” the Irish Independent reported.EU officials also believe that Downing Street is trying to pressure Dublin – with little success. Brussels has been working on a package of temporary support to help ease the short-term impact of a no-deal Brexit, including aid for affected businesses.The IFA spokesperson endorsed that view. “We are very clear that the backstop is not for moving. The idea of the backstop is to maintain the trading relationship that already exists with the EU. As far as we’re concerned we are being supported [in Europe] and will continue to be supported.”But privately EU officials still believe it would be “complete chaos” for the first few days and weeks. Irish businesses are bracing for that.“Call it significant apprehension,” said Paddy Malone, treasurer of Dundalk’s chamber of commerce. “Freight companies are pulling their hair out. If there was certainty we could plan. But they don’t even know what to apply for in terms of state aid because they don’t know what type of aid they may need.”Even so, business owners did not want the backstop diluted to try to avert no deal, said Malone. “The feeling is that it would only postpone the issue, better to face it now.”Andrew Gilmore, deputy director of research at the Dublin-based Institute of International and European Affairs, doubted any British squeeze would succeed. “It’s impossible to imagine a scenario where that kind of pressure will bear results ... especially at this late stage. I don’t see the EU backtracking on its solidarity.”A no-deal Brexit would hurt – for instance, wreaking “catastrophic disruption” on mushroom growers – but Ireland had spent two years preparing for the worst, said Gilmore. “And there is a still strong hope that common sense will prevail.”Conor O’Toole of the Economic and Social Research Institute thinktank said Ireland’s high growth rate would cushion a no-deal Brexit but that high debt levels left the economy vulnerable. Businesses that survived the short-term shock would then face a longer-term challenge, he said. “How do they diversify away from this huge reliance on the UK?”",Ireland steps up effort to shelter economy from no-deal Brexit,2019-02-22/05:00:15+0000,ireland is accelerating preparations for a no deal brexit amid growing alarm that parts of the irish economy could face severe disruption and even collapse and that the uk hopes to leverage that prospect to wring concessions from the european union leo varadkar s government is due on friday to publish a mammoth omnibus bill incorporating  pieces of legislation to try to shelter ireland from the doomsday scenario of the uk crashing out of the eu the parliamentary marathon in dublin will begin amid increasingly fraught warnings of a hammer blow to agriculture food processing transport and other industries simon coveney the deputy prime minister told the dáil on thursday that the european commission would bail out ireland s beef industry in the event of a trade war with britain brussels recognised the sector s vulnerability and would support and protect it he said coveney spoke in the wake of reports that britain envisaged world trade organization wto tariffs plus a system of tariff rate quotas for some food imports which would favour big producers such as brazil at ireland s expense this would be nothing short of a catastrophe for our beef industry and would have a devastating effect on farmers the length and breadth of this country said lisa chambers brexit spokeswoman for the main opposition party fianna fáil more than half of ireland s annual beef exports are sold in the uk the irish farmers association ifa estimates wto tariffs in a no deal brexit would cost ireland s beef farmers m m per year a system favouring cheaper imports from brazil could wipe out irish beef exports to the uk altogether the beef industry is in the front line said an ifa spokesman if there is a crash out there has to be comprehensive package of market supports and direct aid to cover the losses the food major kerry group disclosed this week that it was stockpiling raw materials while british and irish retail organisations issued a joint warning about tariffs of  on food driving up prices for consumers some suspect the uk government is intentionally raising the stakes for ireland in hope that dublin will soften its insistence on the irish backstop and let the eu agree a compromise brexit deal that theresa may can bring to westminster the british plan echoes tactics used against the government of éamon de valera during the anglo irish trade war of the s the irish independent reported eu officials also believe that downing street is trying to pressure dublin with little success brussels has been working on a package of temporary support to help ease the short term impact of a no deal brexit including aid for affected businesses the ifa spokesperson endorsed that view we are very clear that the backstop is not for moving the idea of the backstop is to maintain the trading relationship that already exists with the eu as far as we re concerned we are being supported in europe and will continue to be supported but privately eu officials still believe it would be complete chaos for the first few days and weeks irish businesses are bracing for that call it significant apprehension said paddy malone treasurer of dundalk s chamber of commerce freight companies are pulling their hair out if there was certainty we could plan but they don t even know what to apply for in terms of state aid because they don t know what type of aid they may need even so business owners did not want the backstop diluted to try to avert no deal said malone the feeling is that it would only postpone the issue better to face it now andrew gilmore deputy director of research at the dublin based institute of international and european affairs doubted any british squeeze would succeed it s impossible to imagine a scenario where that kind of pressure will bear results especially at this late stage i don t see the eu backtracking on its solidarity a no deal brexit would hurt for instance wreaking catastrophic disruption on mushroom growers but ireland had spent two years preparing for the worst said gilmore and there is a still strong hope that common sense will prevail conor o toole of the economic and social research institute thinktank said ireland s high growth rate would cushion a no deal brexit but that high debt levels left the economy vulnerable businesses that survived the short term shock would then face a longer term challenge he said how do they diversify away from this huge reliance on the uk ,Brexit,0.238170251
4743,"The British aerospace sector is bracing for a no-deal Brexit, which it estimates could mean billions of pounds in extra costs.The impact on some goods could equate to 38% of their sale value, according to one no-deal Brexit scenario modelled by ADS, a lobby group for the aerospace and defence sectors.The group estimates that new customs checks alone will cost an extra £1.5bn per year. While tariffs are less of an issue for the sector, as most finished aerospace parts are not caught by the levies, import VAT and tariffs on generic parts and raw materials could still add significant costs.That scenario also includes customs checks taking only 70 seconds per vehicle, which the Department for Transport estimates could cause six-day delays at the border.“When you’re selling an aircraft you can’t have any parts missing,” the chief economist at ADS, Jeegar Kakkad, said. “One part stops the whole process.”The output of British aerospace manufacturers fell for the first time in four years in 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics, with concerns around global growth as well as Brexit clouding the outlook.Airbus, one of the UK’s largest aerospace employers at its wing factory and design centre, has warned that a no-deal Brexit could cost it €1bn (£875m) per week, while indicating that it could leave the UK altogether in the event of a disorderly departure. Kakkad added that smaller suppliers are likely to be more vulnerable to problems with cashflow.The aerospace and defence sectors together employed more than 260,000 people in Britain in 2017, according to ADS figures but future expansion by non-British companies could be threatened if new frictions are introduced in the trade between the UK and the EU.Kakkad said: “The issue isn’t about what we have now; it’s if we look halfway through the next decade when decisions are being made on the next set of wings; the next supply chain.”",What are Brexit contingency plans for aerospace and defence?,2019-02-18/14:00:11+0000,the british aerospace sector is bracing for a no deal brexit which it estimates could mean billions of pounds in extra costs the impact on some goods could equate to  of their sale value according to one no deal brexit scenario modelled by ads a lobby group for the aerospace and defence sectors the group estimates that new customs checks alone will cost an extra  bn per year while tariffs are less of an issue for the sector as most finished aerospace parts are not caught by the levies import vat and tariffs on generic parts and raw materials could still add significant costs that scenario also includes customs checks taking only  seconds per vehicle which the department for transport estimates could cause six day delays at the border when you re selling an aircraft you can t have any parts missing the chief economist at ads jeegar kakkad said one part stops the whole process the output of british aerospace manufacturers fell for the first time in four years in  according to the office for national statistics with concerns around global growth as well as brexit clouding the outlook airbus one of the uk s largest aerospace employers at its wing factory and design centre has warned that a no deal brexit could cost it bn m per week while indicating that it could leave the uk altogether in the event of a disorderly departure kakkad added that smaller suppliers are likely to be more vulnerable to problems with cashflow the aerospace and defence sectors together employed more than   people in britain in  according to ads figures but future expansion by non british companies could be threatened if new frictions are introduced in the trade between the uk and the eu kakkad said the issue isn t about what we have now it s if we look halfway through the next decade when decisions are being made on the next set of wings the next supply chain ,Brexit,0.202313602
4913,"Britain is a “waning country” and too small to stand alone on the world stage, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has claimed in a withering assessment of the UK’s exit from the EU.Rutte, who has emerged as a key player in the talks over the past two years, also warned in an interview that the UK looked to be sliding off the “precipice” towards a “devastating” no-deal Brexit.“Who will be left weakened by Brexit is the United Kingdom,” he said. “It is already weakening, it is a waning country compared to two or three years ago. It is going to become an economy of middling size in the Atlantic Ocean. It is neither the US nor the EU. It is too small to appear on the world stage on its own.”Rutte, who also claimed the Dutch would replace the UK in the bloc as the pre-eminent voice for free trade, has been regularly consulted by Theresa May on progress in the Brexit negotiations.The Netherlands is one of the EU member states that will be most affected by the barriers to trade that will emerge after the UK leaves the bloc, although it has been the beneficiary of some relocations by big businesses.Figures released last week by the Dutch investment agency revealed 42 companies had relocated to the Netherlands in 2018, citing Brexit as a reason, resulting in the movement of 1,923 jobs.Asked whether a Brexit deal was likely, Rutte said in an interview with European media outlets, including the Spanish newspaper El País: “My impression is that the ball is heading towards the precipice and everyone screams to stop, but nobody does anything to stop it, at least, from the British side.”He said of the Irish backstop, which has proven to be the most contentious of issues, that Brussels had no intention of trying to use it to trap Britain in a customs union with the EU.The backstop, under which Northern Ireland would stay in the single market and the whole of the UK would share a customs territory, is to come into force should a future trade deal or alternative arrangement be unable to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.Rutte said: “Some British parliamentarians say that we want to trap them in a permanent limbo. But it is not true. The EU is interested in moving to the next phase as soon as possible and starting a new relationship with the United Kingdom.“But given May’s efforts to renegotiate the Irish safeguard, I do not know how this will end and if we can avoid a hard Brexit. It would be devastating for the UK.”Rutte was speaking after a speech in Zurich on Wednesday, in which he highlighted that the “chaos” of Brexit showed “there’s no such thing as splendid isolation”.UK MPs will debate the next steps in the Brexit talks later on Thursday. Theresa May has asked the Commons to approve a motion that “reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January”.Tory MPs in the Eurosceptic European Research Group, chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg, are threatening to rebel as the Commons had expressed both its support for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop and for no deal to be avoided.It has been reported that up to 50 Tory MPs could abstain or vote against the motion, delivering another defeat for the prime minister. A Labour amendment is also seeking to force the government to return to parliament by the end of the month to hold a vote on its Brexit plan.",Dutch PM on Brexit: UK is a waning country too small to stand alone,2019-02-14/09:58:07+0000,britain is a waning country and too small to stand alone on the world stage the dutch prime minister mark rutte has claimed in a withering assessment of the uk s exit from the eu rutte who has emerged as a key player in the talks over the past two years also warned in an interview that the uk looked to be sliding off the precipice towards a devastating no deal brexit who will be left weakened by brexit is the united kingdom he said it is already weakening it is a waning country compared to two or three years ago it is going to become an economy of middling size in the atlantic ocean it is neither the us nor the eu it is too small to appear on the world stage on its own rutte who also claimed the dutch would replace the uk in the bloc as the pre eminent voice for free trade has been regularly consulted by theresa may on progress in the brexit negotiations the netherlands is one of the eu member states that will be most affected by the barriers to trade that will emerge after the uk leaves the bloc although it has been the beneficiary of some relocations by big businesses figures released last week by the dutch investment agency revealed  companies had relocated to the netherlands in  citing brexit as a reason resulting in the movement of   jobs asked whether a brexit deal was likely rutte said in an interview with european media outlets including the spanish newspaper el país my impression is that the ball is heading towards the precipice and everyone screams to stop but nobody does anything to stop it at least from the british side he said of the irish backstop which has proven to be the most contentious of issues that brussels had no intention of trying to use it to trap britain in a customs union with the eu the backstop under which northern ireland would stay in the single market and the whole of the uk would share a customs territory is to come into force should a future trade deal or alternative arrangement be unable to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border on the island of ireland rutte said some british parliamentarians say that we want to trap them in a permanent limbo but it is not true the eu is interested in moving to the next phase as soon as possible and starting a new relationship with the united kingdom but given may s efforts to renegotiate the irish safeguard i do not know how this will end and if we can avoid a hard brexit it would be devastating for the uk rutte was speaking after a speech in zurich on wednesday in which he highlighted that the chaos of brexit showed there s no such thing as splendid isolation uk mps will debate the next steps in the brexit talks later on thursday theresa may has asked the commons to approve a motion that reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the eu expressed by this house on  january tory mps in the eurosceptic european research group chaired by jacob rees mogg are threatening to rebel as the commons had expressed both its support for alternative arrangements to the backstop and for no deal to be avoided it has been reported that up to  tory mps could abstain or vote against the motion delivering another defeat for the prime minister a labour amendment is also seeking to force the government to return to parliament by the end of the month to hold a vote on its brexit plan ,Brexit,0.273066729
4982,"Jarosław Granat has worked for Future Processing since it was a scrappy startup run from the first floor of its founder’s house in the southern Polish city of Gliwice. Now the software development company has more than 900 employees based in a gleaming office complex and serves dozens of blue-chip clients around the world.More than half of the company’s clients are in the UK, and Granat fears that two decades of hard work building up the business could now be put at risk by the looming threat of a no-deal Brexit.“We don’t know how Brexit will look and it could be chaos,” he said. “Very few people, including us, believe that no-deal will happen. But maybe we’re just wishing it won’t.”The company, which started life when its CEO, Jarosław Czaja, was a computer science student at Gliwice’s Silesian University of Technology, now has annual revenue of nearly PLN100m (£20m). The overwhelming majority of employees are still based in Gliwice but many travel regularly to Britain.Just as for many British businesses, the most crippling aspect of the ongoing Brexit negotiations for the companies in central and eastern Europe with major links to Britain is the complete lack of any certainty. Many had assumed that a no-deal Brexit was an impossibility, but with two months to go their faith that a workable deal will be agreed on by all sides and passed through parliament is beginning to be tested.For Future Processing, there are three main concerns about a hard Brexit. First, the likelihood that the pound will plummet, creating currency risk. Second, that transport connections between Poland and the UK will be disrupted, making it harder for the Polish company’s representatives to visit British clients. Finally, that the UK breaking away from EU law will create legal uncertainty and potential additional costs as the Polish and British systems diverge.“We understand that people in the UK and politicians might not have considered the implications a few years ago, but the consequences could be drastic,” said Granat.While making preparations is tricky when nobody knows what kind of Brexit to expect, Future Processing has already made attempts to diversify its client base and thus reduce exposure to the British market. It has also introduced flexibility in contracts to protect against currency fluctuations.A no-deal Brexit is likely to have an economic impact in the broader region well beyond the companies that are inextricably tied to Britain. Vladimir Vano, a Bratislava-based analyst and member of the British Chamber of Commerce in Slovakia, estimated that a hard Brexit would lead to a 1% lower GDP for both Slovakia and the Czech Republic, due to trade disruption and increased bureaucracy, with further indirect impact likely as well.“We are on different edges of the EU geographically, but Britain has gone from zero to be the in the top five or six trade partners for Slovakia and the Czech Republic,” he said.The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development estimates that the direct and indirect effects of a no-deal Brexit could lead the broader region to have a 4-5% smaller GDP by 2021 than it would have done otherwise. The automotive industry could be particularly affected by disruption to supply chains, mainly in Slovakia and Hungary.The uncertainty has already led to a slowdown in some sectors. “In the last three months I’ve seen a delay in contracts coming in from Britain, and I fear I’ll have fewer orders from the UK in the near future,” said Genoveva Hristova, managing director of Bulgaria’s Ligna Group, which makes furniture for luxury hotel chains.Britain is in the group’s top three markets, but she said the company’s contractors were already looking to shift business from Britain to central Europe or Germany to avoid potential Brexit hurdles. Her biggest worry about a no-deal Brexit is the potential customs hurdles.As well as exporters, the tourism sector across the region could also be hit by a potential fall in the pound or a Brexit-related economic slowdown.Boris Šuljić runs the boutique Hotel Boškinac and its associated restaurant and winery on the rugged Croatian island of Pag, which has become a popular destination for British foodies and partygoers in recent years.“British guests love it here, for the clean sea, the food and the crazy parties,” he said. “But we are aware that many of them will cut ‘luxury’ expenses and wait for the epilogue of the Brexit process. Tourism will feel the eventual drop in sterling, and the weakening of consumption power from the British market.”Šuljić, like everyone, was uncertain exactly how Brexit might affect his business, and said he hoped that a “compromise” would be achieved to avoid the problems a no-deal Brexit would entail.For most businesses in the region with exposure to the British market, there remains a hope that the worst will not happen, but as each week goes by, the worry increases. Granat admitted to a frustration with British politicians’ failure to agree on a deal and the hopeless Westminster infighting.“It seems like this is a political discussion where everyone needs to think of the overall picture, and the need to find a compromise, rather than pursuing personal goals. We’re keeping our fingers crossed for a postponement, or a second referendum.”4-5% Estimated impact on GDP across the region from a no-deal Brexit.£2.2m Value of Czech car exports to UK.170,000 Jobs

Thank you.Jeremy Corbyn wrote to Theresa May offering to throw Labour’s support behind her Brexit deal if she made five binding commitments, including joining a customs union but the prime minister wrote back to say no thanks.Westminster watchers said May’s letter was aimed not just at Corbyn and his MPs, aiming to publicly expose how little space there really is between Labour’s Brexit tests and her negotiated deal but also at the rebels in May’s own party.With the two leaders at least talking cordially to each other, however, it does feel like the prospect of some long-overdue Brexit rapprochement may not not be entirely fanciful – which is more can be said of May’s relationship with the EU.The European council president, Donald Tusk’s remark that there should be a “special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit without a plan drew a predictable response, although at least May left Brussels with a promise of further talks from Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, however, repeated that there was no question of Brussels giving in to Downing Street’s demands on the backstop: “Something has to give” in the UK’s position, he said. “We’re waiting for clarity and movement.”Inevitably, with no new suggestions from London on ways to resolve the Irish backstop problem (here’s the definitive read on that), a crunch vote in which MPs could force Theresa May’s hand could be delayed to the end of the month or later.The prime minister also returned from a brief trip to Northern Ireland no closer to any backstop progress, as the head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, said the UK was “in the emergency zone of Brexit now” and continued confusion would not just affect jobs and investment but harm the UK as a long-term business destination.Meanwhile, the government has started recruiting civilians for an emergency command-and-control centre tasked with making sure sure Britain runs smoothly after a no-deal Brexit. The Bank of England warned the economy was on course for its weakest year since the global financial crisis.May will make a Commons statement on Tuesday - at which she is expected to ask MPs for another fortnight’s grace - before parliament debates another amendable motion on Thursday. There will be no “meaningful vote” on a revised deal this week (just “as soon as possible”); that is unlikely to be before the end of February, if not even later.If no finalised deal can be put to the Commons by 27 February, MPs would, however, get another amendable motion to consider allowing them to block a no-deal departure or make other interventions.All this cuts deep into the remaining time, piling pressure on the British parliament to then accept what emerges – or face a no-deal scenario. In Brussels, EU officials are considering offering May a detailed plan of what a potential technological solution to the Irish border might look like, which could be included in the legally non-binding political declaration on the future trade deal.Officials believe it is increasingly likely that any renegotiated deal will only be finally put to the Commons at the end of March – necessitating an extension of the article 50 negotiating period to get legislation through parliament.The German finance commissioner, Günther Hermann Oettinger, has suggested the chance of a no-deal Brexit is as high as 60%.Businesses swamped by Brexit urge Gove to delay all other plans.Manufacturing slump puts UK economy into reverse as Brexit looms.No-deal Brexit would make Britain less safe, says police chief.Brexit “can enhance UK’s lethality”, says defence secretary.Cabinet backs Chris Grayling after ferry fiasco, says minister.Tory donors could stop giving after no-deal Brexit.Netherlands talking to 250 firms about leaving UK.‘Buy your wine now’: the Bordeaux vineyards bottling before Brexit.Brexit as disruptive as disease outbreak, says farmers’ leader.End uncertainty over no-deal Brexit, says ex-civil service chief.Shanker Singham owns a firm giving advice on EU exit.Countdown to Brexit: the key dates as UK’s EU exit approaches.Keir Starmer battles to keep Labour support for people’s vote alive.No-deal Brexit: UK exporters risk being locked out of world’s harbours.No-deal Brexit could revive mobile roaming fees, minister confirms.Brexit could be good for UK environment, says top government adviser.Not opposing Brexit could lose Labour 45 seats, says leaked report.No quick fix for citizen rights under no-deal Brexit, says EU official.Business secretary suggests ministers could quit over no-deal Brexit.In the Observer, Nick Cohen says that in the United Kingdom of Absurdistan, a hidden government is preparing for Brexit by keeping us in the dark:As the Institute for Government, MPs and MEPs warn, the real scandal has nothing to do with the fantasy remain bias of the civil service and all to do with secrecy.

5218,"Theresa May has failed to rally Northern Ireland support behind her quest for a Brexit deal, as nationalist and unionist parties further entrenched their positions for and against the backstop as she ended a two-day visit to Belfast.The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) insisted on Wednesday that the prime minister should replace the backstop a day after May appeared to soften the government’s stance on the insurance provision to protect against a hard border.Westminster had voted to leave the European Union with “alternative arrangements” for the Irish border, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said after meeting May at Stormont.“It is welcome that the prime inister is travelling to Brussels to seek changes but she must stand strong and by the commitments she made to the House of Commons. That is her mandate and that is what I expect. The backstop would undermine the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom ... it is the main problem.”The DUP’s stance will limit the prime minister’s room for manoeuvre when she visits Brussels on Thursday to seek a revised Brexit deal with the EU.May arrived in Belfast on Tuesday saying she sought a deal that would command “broad support” in Northern Ireland.She received a respectful, wary response from business leaders but the party’s five main parties appeared more polarised after meeting her at Stormont. It is the site of the region’s power-sharing assembly, which has been mothballed for two years in a dispute between Sinn Féin and the DUP.The Ulster Unionist party (UUP) urged the prime minister to introduce direct rule government for Northern Ireland if no Brexit deal can be agreed – anathema to republicans.Sinn Féin, which supports the backstop, issued a harsh rebuff to May, saying she lacked credibility and was hostage to the DUP support at Westminster. It called for a referendum on Irish unity.“We are now 51 days from the Brexit deadline and the British prime minister has come here empty handed with the same old rhetoric with no plan, no credibility and frankly no honour,” said Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald.“We have told her that the British strategy of running down the clock and playing a game of chicken with Ireland and Irish interests is profoundly unacceptable and wrong. We have told her that the days of Britain dictating to Ireland or Irish people, that those days are over and will not return.”McDonald endorsed a statement from Donald Tusk, the European council president, that a “special place in hell” awaited irresponsible Brexiters.Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman in Westminster, called Tusk a “devilish trident-wielding Euro maniac” who disrespected those who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.The mood at Stormont was further soured by the appearance of graffiti saying “IRA here to stay” in five-foot letters across historic walls in Derry, the scene of a New IRA car bomb last month.May is scheduled to visit Dublin on Friday for what are likely to be tense talks with the Irish governmentSpeaking from Brussels the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the Irish government had secured land at Dublin and Rosslare ports for checks as it ramped up preparations for the UK potentially crashing out without a deal on 29 March.A joint statement from Varadkar and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, threw cold water on suggestions from some Brexiters that London and Dublin could tweak the backstop.“The backstop is not a bilateral issue, but a European one. Ireland’s border is also the border of the European Union and its market is part of the single market. We will stay united on this matter.”",Brexit: May departs Northern Ireland no closer to backstop deal,2019-02-06/17:47:26+0000,theresa may has failed to rally northern ireland support behind her quest for a brexit deal as nationalist and unionist parties further entrenched their positions for and against the backstop as she ended a two day visit to belfast the democratic unionist party dup insisted on wednesday that the prime minister should replace the backstop a day after may appeared to soften the government s stance on the insurance provision to protect against a hard border westminster had voted to leave the european union with alternative arrangements for the irish border arlene foster the dup leader said after meeting may at stormont it is welcome that the prime inister is travelling to brussels to seek changes but she must stand strong and by the commitments she made to the house of commons that is her mandate and that is what i expect the backstop would undermine the economic and constitutional integrity of the united kingdom it is the main problem the dup s stance will limit the prime minister s room for manoeuvre when she visits brussels on thursday to seek a revised brexit deal with the eu may arrived in belfast on tuesday saying she sought a deal that would command broad support in northern ireland she received a respectful wary response from business leaders but the party s five main parties appeared more polarised after meeting her at stormont it is the site of the region s power sharing assembly which has been mothballed for two years in a dispute between sinn féin and the dup the ulster unionist party uup urged the prime minister to introduce direct rule government for northern ireland if no brexit deal can be agreed anathema to republicans sinn féin which supports the backstop issued a harsh rebuff to may saying she lacked credibility and was hostage to the dup support at westminster it called for a referendum on irish unity we are now  days from the brexit deadline and the british prime minister has come here empty handed with the same old rhetoric with no plan no credibility and frankly no honour said sinn féin s leader mary lou mcdonald we have told her that the british strategy of running down the clock and playing a game of chicken with ireland and irish interests is profoundly unacceptable and wrong we have told her that the days of britain dictating to ireland or irish people that those days are over and will not return mcdonald endorsed a statement from donald tusk the european council president that a special place in hell awaited irresponsible brexiters sammy wilson the dup s brexit spokesman in westminster called tusk a devilish trident wielding euro maniac who disrespected those who voted to leave the eu in the  referendum the mood at stormont was further soured by the appearance of graffiti saying ira here to stay in five foot letters across historic walls in derry the scene of a new ira car bomb last month may is scheduled to visit dublin on friday for what are likely to be tense talks with the irish governmentspeaking from brussels the taoiseach leo varadkar said the irish government had secured land at dublin and rosslare ports for checks as it ramped up preparations for the uk potentially crashing out without a deal on  march a joint statement from varadkar and jean claude juncker the european commission president threw cold water on suggestions from some brexiters that london and dublin could tweak the backstop the backstop is not a bilateral issue but a european one ireland s border is also the border of the european union and its market is part of the single market we will stay united on this matter ,Brexit,0.304094315
5262,"Brexit is about drawing lines on maps and hearts. In that respect it is at odds with the 1998 Good Friday agreement which sought to erase them. Key to ending the Troubles was the removal of the hard border between the north and south of Ireland. Theresa May’s problem is that she has committed to leaving the European Union while respecting the peace deal that depended on both London and Dublin being part of it. The agreement made less salient the questions of identity: under its provisions people in Northern Ireland could be, uncontroversially, citizens of Britain or Ireland. What did it matter if they were part of a club that allowed people to travel, work and reside anywhere? North-south institutions were set up to oversee common endeavours. The agreement was sold as a “stepping stone to a united Ireland” to republicans, while unionists held that it was “securing the union”. The symbolism was key: with a hard border you can see that the island is partitioned, without it you cannot.Aware of this, London and Dublin committed not to return to the days of border checkpoints, which would risk undermining the peace deal’s principles. Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement enshrines this in law in the form of an insurance policy: to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal, there would be a backstop arrangement to allow for frictionless trade. Fanatical rightwing anti-EU Tory MPs were not bothered about the peace process, or the aspirations of fellow subjects. Instead, they saw in the insurance policy a devious mechanism to force Britain to march in lockstep with EU regulations that hard Brexiters were desperate to get out of. To reverse her government’s historic Commons defeat, Mrs May voted to replace the backstop. She did so to win over the Democratic Unionist party, but her actions enraged businesses in Northern Ireland which had publicly backed her deal.In Belfast on Tuesday, the prime minister was back to the push-me-pull-you politics of Brexit. She signalled that, rather than the “alternative arrangements” to the backstop floated previously, she was edging towards an insurance policy that could either be time-limited or allow for a unilateral withdrawal. The prime minister may have said more than she intended, as a group of her MPs considering “alternative arrangements” were meeting in London as she spoke. Neither of Mrs May’s offers seem possible in a strictly legal sense, but both could be rendered in political terms. Almost everyone agrees that the backstop must be a temporary measure, but no one wants to say so in law. On such anvils, political follies can be forged. Mrs May’s problem stems from the fact that the only Northern Ireland party represented in the Commons is the DUP. The party’s role in itself undermines a core principle of the Good Friday agreement, that the position of the British government would be “neutral” – it had no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland and would accept the unification of Ireland by consent. The DUP-Conservative pact, a result of the 2017 election, calls this aspect into question. The DUP represents only a third of Northern Irish votes cast in 2017.Even more glaring is that Northern Ireland voted to remain. Unionism risks defeating itself if it becomes too closely identified with Brexit. Belatedly, Mrs May’s ministers have woken up to the democratic deficit in Northern Ireland and called for the restoration of Stormont. These islands are sold as a story of stability. Political scientist Roger Awan-Scully says history would differ. Less than a century ago, the UK lost a greater proportion of its territory – through Irish independence – than Germany had lost in the treaty of Versailles. In 2014, close to half of Scotland voted for independence. Fragmentation is by no means inevitable, but without a sense of common purpose and community it becomes more and more a possibility.• This article was amended on 6 February 2019 to change “The DUP represents only a third of votes cast in 2017” to “The DUP represents only a third of Northern Irish votes cast in 2017”.",The Guardian view on Brexit and Ireland: the forging of folly,2019-02-05/18:54:03+0000,brexit is about drawing lines on maps and hearts in that respect it is at odds with the  good friday agreement which sought to erase them key to ending the troubles was the removal of the hard border between the north and south of ireland theresa may s problem is that she has committed to leaving the european union while respecting the peace deal that depended on both london and dublin being part of it the agreement made less salient the questions of identity under its provisions people in northern ireland could be uncontroversially citizens of britain or ireland what did it matter if they were part of a club that allowed people to travel work and reside anywhere north south institutions were set up to oversee common endeavours the agreement was sold as a stepping stone to a united ireland to republicans while unionists held that it was securing the union the symbolism was key with a hard border you can see that the island is partitioned without it you cannot aware of this london and dublin committed not to return to the days of border checkpoints which would risk undermining the peace deal s principles mrs may s withdrawal agreement enshrines this in law in the form of an insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of ireland in the event that the uk leaves the eu without securing an all encompassing deal there would be a backstop arrangement to allow for frictionless trade fanatical rightwing anti eu tory mps were not bothered about the peace process or the aspirations of fellow subjects instead they saw in the insurance policy a devious mechanism to force britain to march in lockstep with eu regulations that hard brexiters were desperate to get out of to reverse her government s historic commons defeat mrs may voted to replace the backstop she did so to win over the democratic unionist party but her actions enraged businesses in northern ireland which had publicly backed her deal in belfast on tuesday the prime minister was back to the push me pull you politics of brexit she signalled that rather than the alternative arrangements to the backstop floated previously she was edging towards an insurance policy that could either be time limited or allow for a unilateral withdrawal the prime minister may have said more than she intended as a group of her mps considering alternative arrangements were meeting in london as she spoke neither of mrs may s offers seem possible in a strictly legal sense but both could be rendered in political terms almost everyone agrees that the backstop must be a temporary measure but no one wants to say so in law on such anvils political follies can be forged mrs may s problem stems from the fact that the only northern ireland party represented in the commons is the dup the party s role in itself undermines a core principle of the good friday agreement that the position of the british government would be neutral it had no selfish strategic or economic interest in northern ireland and would accept the unification of ireland by consent the dup conservative pact a result of the  election calls this aspect into question the dup represents only a third of northern irish votes cast in  even more glaring is that northern ireland voted to remain unionism risks defeating itself if it becomes too closely identified with brexit belatedly mrs may s ministers have woken up to the democratic deficit in northern ireland and called for the restoration of stormont these islands are sold as a story of stability political scientist roger awan scully says history would differ less than a century ago the uk lost a greater proportion of its territory through irish independence than germany had lost in the treaty of versailles in  close to half of scotland voted for independence fragmentation is by no means inevitable but without a sense of common purpose and community it becomes more and more a possibility this article was amended on  february  to change the dup represents only a third of votes cast in  to the dup represents only a third of northern irish votes cast in  ,Brexit,0.254340231
5263,"Ireland is in talks with the EU over a substantial Brexit emergency fund to offset the damage caused to the country’s €4.5bn (£3.96bn) food exports to Britain if the UK crashes out of the bloc with no deal next month.As Theresa May prepares for a crunch meeting in Brussels on Thursday, officials at the European commission are already looking at continuous compensatory measures for Ireland as part of an ongoing arrangement that could last years.Contingency funds to compensate farmers have already been discussed at the highest levels and are expected to arise in talks with the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, during a round of meetings in Brussels on Wednesday.Sources say Ireland will be looking for a “long-term fix” in EU budget talks in April rather than a lump sum Brexit bailout.Politicians have cited the ongoing assistance given to the Baltic states after Russia banned certain food exports from the EU as an example of financial solidarity it hopes to win in a no-deal Brexit.Ireland exports €4.5bn worth of food and drink a year to the UK, ranging from beef to cheddar cheese. Calculations by the Department of Agriculture put the cost of tariffs under World Trade Organization rules at €1.7bn.Michael Creed, Ireland’s minister for agriculture, food and the marine, has said this would be an “existential challenge” for the food and drink sector. He has previously said Ireland would seek “mega-money” from the EU.The beef industry alone could face increased costs of up to €700m, which the head of the Irish Farmers Association has said has the potential to wipe out beef production in the country.There are also concerns if Britain flips the other way and adopts a zero-tariffs policy, as this could result in cheaper chicken, beef and lamb from the US and South America displacing both British and Irish cuts from shop shelves.Creed has already talked of the European commission’s “readiness to respond to that crisis should it develop in the context of a crash out”.Informed sources say that ongoing assistance over many years will be the preferred option rather than a lump sum in a Brexit “bailout”.“Flexibility on state aid rules may be one we look for, but any fix is likely to come in the European budget discussions, which start in April, because a no-deal Brexit will have an ongoing impact and will be unpredictable,” said a source referring to the negotiations for the next EU financial cycle of 2020 to 2027.While Brexit is unprecedented, the assistance given to the Baltic states after Russia banned European food exports has been cited as a model for Ireland.Exports from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to Russia dropped by €5.8bn since 2014 and are still being supported by the EU.Creed has said Ireland’s ambition is to “ride out the difficulty” and “retain a foothold” in the UK with early engagement with the European commission in terms of “the need for aid, particularly exceptional aid on the beef side and also exchequer response”.He added that he would also be looking for “flexibility” in state aid rules to allow the Irish government to intervene.Sources in the European commission say they have not come to a view yet but “clearly there will be sympathy and understanding”.A spokesman for the commissioner for agriculture and rural development confirmed they had “explored the ways in which the EU could help Ireland and Irish businesses”.“There are possibilities under the Common Market Organisation which, for example, were used in response to the Russian ban and the subsequent dairy crisis. There are also possibilities under state aid rules, which have also been discussed.”Those working on Brexit preparedness at InterTradeIreland, an organisation set up under the Good Friday Agreement to help build cross-border business, say an area of particular concern is the impact a hard Brexit may have on ”micro-businesses” with fewer than 10 people. In Northern Ireland 3,800 micro firms, employing 13,000 people, regularly trade across the border.They have found 7,500 SMEs north of the border and “double that” south of the border that trade on both sides.Eight in 10 of micro businesses north of the border export exclusively to Ireland and few have any experience of filling out customs declarations forms or understanding tariff regimes.“They are the ones most likely to be affected by barriers to market access,” said Kerry Curran, policy research manager, as they are likely to be trading within supply chains and “also have less capacity to absorb the cost” of the extra administrative burden.",Ireland and EU discuss emergency funds to offset no-deal Brexit,2019-02-05/18:52:01+0000,ireland is in talks with the eu over a substantial brexit

5508,"European governments have said Britain must swiftly spell out its proposed Irish backstop alternatives and insisted the Brexit divorce deal cannot be revisited, as the continent’s media and commentators condemned Theresa May as weak and untrustworthy.Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said on Wednesday that London had “not yet said what changes to the backstop it envisages. It must now say quickly what it wants because time is running out.” The EU was ready to talk, he added, but “our position is clear: the agreement is the best and only solution for an orderly exit”.The German economic affairs ministry cited fear of a chaotic Brexit as one reason for slashing its 2018 economic growth forecast from 1.8% to 1%, while the country’s BDI industry association said it was “very difficult” for German companies to see London was “further playing with valuable time” ahead of Brexit day on 29 March.The UK parliament on Tuesday instructed May to seek changes from the EU27 to the withdrawal agreement she concluded with the EU last November. The bloc has said repeatedly that the deal could not be reopened.France’s Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseau, said time was running out. “We are ready to talk about the future, but now is the time to agree on the conditions of separation,” she said. “The withdrawal agreement on the table is the best possible agreement. Let’s not reopen it.”The office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, noted in a statement that the agreement had been adopted jointly by the British government and the EU27. “This cannot be renegotiated,” it said. “The EU has been clear on this point.”The statement added that if the UK wanted to discuss the future UK-EU relationship, the EU was “open to that, with respect for its interests and values”. Britain must in any case now “clarify its intentions and make credible proposals”.Romania’s minister for European affairs, George Ciamba, told the Guardian that it was “a measure of the mistrust that you have in Britain” that the backstop had become such a sticking point for British MPs: “We didn’t think for one second that the backstop is there forever. Nobody wants to transform this into a hostage relationship.”Romania holds the rotating EU presidency and hosts an informal meeting of foreign ministers this week. Ciamba ruled out reopening the agreement but said he was still optimistic a deal could be reached. “It’s a political exercise and everyone has to save face, but I don’t think this is the end of the story,” he said.The Portuguese foreign minister, Augusto Santos Silva, said the EU was “ready to listen and give our position”, but only if Britain asked for an extension to the article 50 talks in order to present the bloc with “alternatives to its Brexit red lines, and clear alternatives to the backstop”.Margot Wallström, Sweden’s foreign minister, said she “cannot forgive” the British government’s “dangerous … and badly handled” approach to Brexit, adding: “I just think they’ve made such a historical mistake. They’ve really created a problem for all of us.”The European media was equally damning, accusing the prime minister of putting party before country. “To avoid the disintegration of her own Conservative party, Theresa May is now risking a major showdown with the EU,” wrote the French paper Le Monde’s London correspondent, Philippe Bernard.“Two months before the divorce date, she hopes to question two years of discussions with the EU27 – ditching her own handiwork.” British MPs sent two contradictory messages, the paper said: “One majority rejected no deal; another mandated May to begin a renegotiation so hypothetical as to risk a no deal.”As for the prime minister, she made her strategy very clear: “As risky as it is, she intends to run down the clock so as to force the EU27 into making concessions before 29 March. And then, if necessary, blame the EU – an easy scapegoat – for eventual failure.”In Germany, Björn Finke in the Süddeutsche Zeitung said the best way forward for May would undoubtedly be to approach Labour with concessions on a permanent customs union. “But that would lose her the support of hardcore Brexiteers in her own party, and risk splitting the Conservatives,” he said.“Since May lacks the courage and the leadership to take such a step, she prefers the seemingly simpler way: renegotiation. Brussels cannot trust her promise to win a majority if changes are made to the deal. May does not have her own party under control. May’s weakness is dangerous, for Britain and for the rest of the EU.”In an opinion piece for El País attacking May’s “startling disloyalty”, Xavier Vidal-Folch said bluntly the British prime minister “can no longer be trusted. Not because her judgment and arguments lack depth, but because she changes them at every step.”It is true that this “worries the Europeans”, Vidal-Folch said. “That’s why they’re drawing up contingency plans, which only remind them of the losses ahead. But those who’ll suffer the most damage are the British themselves.“The car industry, banks and technology sector are all putting the finishing touches to their own partial or total ex-Brit plans. It’s not abstract markets that will tip the balance, but real businesses, inventors, professionals and doctors. Because May can no longer be trusted.”NRC Handelsblad in the Netherlands was equally brutal. “To save her Brexit deal, avoid a split in her party and retain the minimum of control a prime minister needs, May aims to provoke a conflict with the EU,” it said.“What has not proved possible in the past two years now has to be sorted in a fortnight, before the next parliamentary vote … The job looks impossible. The moment of truth approaches for British politics.”","Show us your backstop alternatives, EU governments tell May",2019-01-30/10:36:10+0000,european governments have said britain must swiftly spell

5525,"MPs have voted on a series of amendments to Theresa May’s statement on the defeat of her Brexit bill.Below are the amendments that were voted upon, as selected by Speaker John Bercow. This is the order in which they were taken:A: LabourO: the SNPG: Dominic GrieveB: Yvette CooperJ: Rachel ReevesI: Caroline SpelmanN: Graham BradyAmendment defeated by 327 votes to 296, a majority of 31.Tabled by Jeremy Corbyn and backed by a series of frontbenchers, this pushes the party policy of avoiding no deal and instead seeking a form of customs union.Amendment defeated by 321 votes to 298, a majority of 23.One of the most closely scrutinised amendments, and backed by more than 70 MPs, this would guarantee parliamentary time for a private members’ bill drafted by Cooper that would extend article 50 to the end of 2019 if Theresa May failed to secure a deal by late February. While it seems likely to win official Labour backing, and from some Tories, it could be scuppered by doubts among Labour MPs in leave-voting areas. The government will whip MPs against backing it.Amendment defeated by 321 votes to 301, a majority of 20.This idea by the former attorney general would allow parliament to take control in creating a series of indicative votes by decreeing that a motion put forward by a minority of 300 MPs from at least five parties – including 10 Tory MPs – would be debated as the first item for MPs in the Commons the next day.Amendment passed by 318 votes to 310, a majority of eight.Tabled by the longstanding Tory MP and former environment minister Caroline Spelman, with the backing of more than 115 MPs from various parties, this states that the UK will not leave the EU without a deal. It is only advisory and has no legislative force.Amendment defeated by 322 votes to 290, a majority of 32.Signed by a cross-party group of remain-minded MPs, led by Labour’s Rachel Reeves, this would seek a two-year extension of article 50 if there is not a deal in place by 26 February.Amendment passed by 317 votes to 301, a majority of 16.Its figurehead is Graham Brady, who as chair of the 1922 Committee is the voice of Tory backbenchers. Yet another attempt at making the backstop more palatable to Tory MPs, this says it should be “replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”. Once again, this is something the EU has ruled out. The government has indicated that it will whip MPs to back the amendment, which if passed would allow May to go to Brussels with a clear sign from MPs of what they want, to get a deal through parliament.Amendment defeated by 327 votes to 39, a majority of 288.This notes that the Scottish and Welsh assemblies also “voted overwhelmingly to reject the prime minister’s deal”, calling for an extension of article 50 and no deal being removed as an option.Amendments not selected or withdrawn:These all called, in various ways, for a second EU referendum. Three amendments-to-the-amendment were tabled by Labour backbenchers, and two by the Liberal Democrats. The Lib Dems also tabled a separate amendment on the subject.This would have created a committee of no more than 17 MPs based on representation in the Commons to lead on all Brexit matters in parliament.Tabled again by the Conservative backbencher Andrew Murrison, and backed by more than 30 other Tories, this would have decreed that the Irish backstop, if it came into force, would expire at the end of 2021 – something the EU has said it will not agree to. Withdrawn to improve the chances of support for Brady’s amendment.This would have called for a series of non-binding indicative votes in parliament to determine the way forward. It was tabled by Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the Brexit select committee.Backed by a cross-party group of opposition MPs this would have created a 250-strong “citizens’ assembly”, a representative but randomly selected group, to devise possible ways to move forward on Brexit.These said that MPs would not back a withdrawal agreement including a backstop with variations calling for it to be permitted only if it expires after six months or if it contains a right of unilateral UK withdrawal (M).Tabled by the Brexit-backing former Labour MP Frank Field but supported by remainers

5565,"Labour was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on Monday over the government’s flagship immigration bill, after initially saying it would not oppose the legislation that brings free movement to an end.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, had sparked a backlash among MPs when she told the House of Commons that the frontbench would not vote against the post-Brexit legislation.“The Labour party is clear that when Britain leaves the single market, freedom of movement ends, and we set this out in our 2017 manifesto. I am a slavish devotee of that magnificent document: so on that basis, the frontbench of the Labour party will not be opposing this bill this evening,” she said.She added that Labour would abstain at this stage, known as second reading, and seek amendments later.Abbott then tweeted that the bill put “the cart before the horse” because it seeks to establish a new immigration regime before the UK’s future relationship with the EU has been settled. “Labour wants to amend bill substantially. Today isn’t a final vote!” she added.But 90 minutes later, amid a growing backlash on social media, Labour shifted its position and announced that it would whip its MPs to vote against the bill – though many had been told by the whips that they did not need to be present in Westminster on Monday.Despite Labour’s change of heart, the government won the vote by 297 votes to 234, a comfortable majority of 63. With only a one-line whip in force, many of Labour’s 256 MPs had permission to be absent, and just 178 were present for the late-night vote.The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Ed Davey, accused Labour of missing a potential opportunity to defeat the government, pointing out that two Conservative MPs, Anna Soubry and Ken Clarke, had rebelled.“It is beyond belief that some Tory MPs were more organised on opposing the government’s hostile immigration policies than the Labour shadow cabinet,” he said.One usually loyal backbench Labour MP described his party leadership’s flip-flop on the bill as a “meltdown”, adding: “Anyone with one foot on the ground could have told you the optics of the abstention, given Brexit sensitivities, was shocking.”Several Labour backbenchers, including Chris Leslie and Angela Smith, had intervened to press Abbott, a longtime defender of immigration, on whether MPs would be whipped to oppose the bill – and signalled that they planned to rebel and vote against it.Theresa May has repeatedly said that her Brexit deal will bring freedom of movement for EU citizens to an end, and that the immigration bill will establish the new, stricter regime.Abbott had fiercely criticised the legislation as MPs debated it on Monday, calling it “one of the flimsiest pieces of legislation on a major issue that I or many of my colleagues have seen”. “This bill, the immigration white paper and the accompanying media narrative, plays to some of the very worst aspects of the Brexit debate. In the process, it risks doing irreparable damage to business, the economy and society,” she said.Immigration is at the heart of Labour’s internal tussle over how to respond to the referendum result of June 2016. Some MPs, particularly in leave-voting constituencies, believe Labour has little choice but to accede to the demands of voters who want to see controls on immigration – a phrase Ed Miliband was criticised for plastering on mugs during the 2015 general election campaign.Other Labour MPs, including the chair of the centrist group Progress, Alison McGovern, believe their party should be making the argument strongly for the benefits of immigration.The Tory MP Ken Clarke said of Abbott: “She’s actually been making an extremely coherent root-and-branch criticism of the bill, and she has an excellent record on these things; but the problem is, we’re meant to be debating whether this House of Commons will approve the second reading of the bill.“She’s denouncing it from beginning to end, but is saying the opposition don’t intend to vote against it. This makes the proceedings quite absurd.”",Labour makes abrupt U-turn over immigration bill vote,2019-01-28/20:12:21+0000,labour was forced into an embarrassing u turn on monday over the government s flagship immigration bill after initially saying it would not oppose the legislation that brings free movement to an end the shadow home secretary diane abbott had sparked a backlash among mps when she told the house of commons that the frontbench would not vote against the post brexit legislation the labour party is clear that when britain leaves the single market freedom of movement ends and we set this out in our  manifesto i am a slavish devotee of that magnificent document so on that basis the frontbench of the labour party will not be opposing this bill this evening she said she added that labour would abstain at this stage known as second reading and seek amendments later abbott then tweeted that the bill put the cart before the horse because it seeks to establish a new immigration regime before the uk s future relationship with the eu has been settled labour wants to amend bill substantially today isn t a final vote she added but  minutes later amid a growing backlash on social media labour shifted its position and announced that it would whip its mps to vote against the bill though many had been told by the whips that they did not need to be present in westminster on monday despite labour s change of heart the government won the vote by  votes to  a comfortable majority of  with only a one line whip in force many of labour s  mps had permission to be absent and just  were present for the late night vote the liberal democrat home affairs spokesman ed davey accused labour of missing a potential opportunity to defeat the government pointing out that two conservative mps anna soubry and ken clarke had rebelled it is beyond belief that some tory mps were more organised on opposing the government s hostile immigration policies than the labour shadow cabinet he said one usually loyal backbench labour mp described his party leadership s flip flop on the bill as a meltdown adding anyone with one foot on the ground could have told you the optics of the abstention given brexit sensitivities was shocking several labour backbenchers including chris leslie and angela smith had intervened to press abbott a longtime defender of immigration on whether mps would be whipped to oppose the bill and signalled that they planned to rebel and vote against it theresa may has repeatedly said that her brexit deal will bring freedom of movement for eu citizens to an end and that the immigration bill will establish the new stricter regime abbott had fiercely criticised the legislation as mps debated it on monday calling it one of the flimsiest pieces of legislation on a major issue that i or many of my colleagues have seen this bill the immigration white paper and the accompanying media narrative plays to some of the very worst aspects of the brexit debate in the process it risks doing irreparable damage to business the economy and society she said immigration is at the heart of labour s internal tussle over how to respond to the referendum result of june  some mps particularly in leave voting constituencies believe labour has little choice but to accede to the demands of voters who want to see controls on immigration a phrase ed miliband was criticised for plastering on mugs during the  general election campaign other labour mps including the chair of the centrist group progress alison mcgovern believe their party should be making the argument strongly for the benefits of immigration the tory mp ken clarke said of abbott she s actually been making an extremely coherent root and branch criticism of the bill and she has an excellent record on these things but the problem is we re meant to be debating whether this house of commons will approve the second reading of the bill she s denouncing it from beginning to end but is saying the opposition don t intend to vote against it this makes the proceedings quite absurd ,Brexit,0.175277099
5576,"Scottish ministers are rushing through dozens of urgent legislative changes in an last-minute effort to protect Scottish businesses and consumers from a no-deal Brexit.The Scottish government has identified 36 legislative measures it believes are critical and must be in place before 29 March to ensure devolved areas such as farming, fisheries, food safety, the environment, animal welfare and forestry are protected if the UK crashes out of the EU.Officials and party business managers at Holyrood are preparing to order late parliamentary sittings, cancelling non-essential debates or votes and holding extra committee hearings to sit at the same time as parliament is in session to help cope with the surge in work.Mike Russell, Scotland’s secretary for constitutional affairs, said his government had a duty to prepare for Brexit and was redeploying staff to do so.“We share the frustrations of businesses, communities and individuals across the country that we are being forced to prepare for a range of uncertain and unknown scenarios, diverting resources away from other areas, as we leave the EU against the wishes of the majority of Scots,” he said.The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has estimated the Scottish government’s preparations for Brexit will cost nearly £100m by April 2020, including planning for a no-deal scenario.“The future total figure could be considerably greater, this is all money that could have been invested in our struggling NHS, schools or rail services,” Dugdale said.Quitting the EU means hundreds of pieces of legislation need to be amended to ensure laws in force across the UK and devolved nations are updated to guarantee the same legal standards and protections in place now are in force after Brexit.Most of those changes are being pushed through Westminster, Holyrood and the Welsh assembly using statutory instruments, a type of secondary legislation that can be introduced without passing a new act. In some cases changes to different laws will be bundled up into one statutory instrument, and in some high-priority cases they require a parliamentary vote to agree them.Despite last year’s legal battle between the UK and Scottish governments over Holyrood’s emergency Brexit legislation, known as the continuity bill, Scottish and UK civil servants have agreed to share the workload in updating the affected laws.Whitehall has already written and overseen a large majority of the statutory instruments that affect Scottish legislation before sending those to Holyrood for formal approval under UK-wide “common frameworks”.By 23 January, 105 UK-wide statutory instruments had been passed by MSPs, covering areas such as nuclear safety, genetically modified foods, tobacco controls, greenhouse gas emissions trading, gender equality, renewable energy, organ transplants and food safety.However, that leaves scores of changes for Scottish ministers to oversee using Scottish statutory instruments (SSIs). In addition to the 36 critical measures that Holyrood needs to process before 29 March, dozens of other SSIs will need to be approved after Brexit day.Scottish ministers are cautious about disclosing the titles of these measures before they are tabled, citing the need to observe the protocol that parliament should be told first.Russell is meanwhile in talks with opposition parties about when and whether to table an amended continuity bill. The UK supreme court ruled in December that the continuity bill was unlawful, in large part because the UK government altered Holyrood’s legal powers after it had been introduced, stopping it being enacted in its current form.He would not be drawn on what would happen next, but legal sources say they believe its fate hangs on what happens with Brexit at Westminster.Opposition MSPs suspect Russell plans to table new farming and fisheries bills after Brexit, which could cause friction with UK legislation being proposed by Michael Gove, the environment secretary.",Scotland hurries legislation to protect against no-deal Brexit,2019-01-28/16:36:13+0000,scottish ministers are rushing through dozens of urgent legislative changes in an last minute effort to protect scottish businesses and consumers from a no deal brexit the scottish government has identified  legislative measures it believes are critical and must be in place before  march to ensure devolved areas such as farming fisheries food safety the environment animal welfare and forestry are protected if the uk crashes out of the eu officials and party business managers at holyrood are preparing to order late parliamentary sittings cancelling non essential debates or votes and holding extra committee hearings to sit at the same time as parliament is in session to help cope with the surge in work mike russell scotland s secretary for constitutional affairs said his government had a duty to prepare for brexit and was redeploying staff to do so we share the frustrations of businesses communities and individuals across the country that we are being forced to prepare for a range of uncertain and unknown scenarios diverting resources away from other areas as we leave the eu against the wishes of the majority of scots he said the former scottish labour leader kezia dugdale has estimated the scottish government s preparations for brexit will cost nearly m by april  including planning for a no deal scenario the future total figure could be considerably greater this is all money that could have been invested in our struggling nhs schools or rail services dugdale said quitting the eu means hundreds of pieces of legislation need to be amended to ensure laws in force across the uk and devolved nations are updated to guarantee the same legal standards and protections in place now are in force after brexit most of those changes are being pushed through westminster holyrood and the welsh assembly using statutory instruments a type of secondary legislation that can be introduced without passing a new act in some cases changes to different laws will be bundled up into one statutory instrument and in some high priority cases they require a parliamentary vote to agree them despite last year s legal battle between the uk and scottish governments over holyrood s emergency brexit legislation known as the continuity bill scottish and uk civil servants have agreed to share the workload in updating the affected laws whitehall has already written and overseen a large majority of the statutory instruments that affect scottish legislation before sending those to holyrood for formal approval under uk wide common frameworks by  january  uk wide statutory instruments had been passed by msps covering areas such as nuclear safety genetically modified foods tobacco controls greenhouse gas emissions trading gender equality renewable energy organ transplants and food safety however that leaves scores of changes for scottish ministers to oversee using scottish statutory instruments ssis in addition to the  critical measures that holyrood needs to process before  march dozens of other ssis will need to be approved after brexit day scottish ministers are cautious about disclosing the titles of these measures before they are tabled citing the need to observe the protocol that parliament should be told first russell is meanwhile in talks with opposition parties about when and whether to table an amended continuity bill the uk supreme court ruled in december that the continuity bill was unlawful in large part because the uk government altered holyrood s legal powers after it had been introduced stopping it being enacted in its current form he would not be drawn on what would happen next but legal sources say they believe its fate hangs on what happens with brexit at westminster opposition msps suspect russell plans to table new farming and fisheries bills after brexit which could cause friction with uk legislation being proposed by michael gove the environment secretary ,Brexit,0.202983394
5609,"Ireland has launched a last-minute effort to warn Theresa May off any attempt to unravel the backstop, two days before a crucial Commons debate that may decide the next move for the UK’s rudderless Brexit policy.Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister, insisted the backstop – the mechanism to ensure there will be no hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland if Britain and the EU fail to strike a free trade deal – was “part of a balanced package that isn’t going to change”. In a forceful interview, he insisted it was only part of the withdrawal agreement because of the UK’s red lines.On Tuesday Tory Brexiters may get the chance to vote for amendments that would signal their willingness to back May’s Brexit deal subject to the backstop’s either being removed or time-limited.Ministers have not formally backed any of the anti-backstop amendments, which are incompatible with the deal that May agreed with UK leaders, but if one were to pass by a majority, she would be able to present the EU with a firm idea of what changes might get her deal through parliament – something that as yet remains unclear to Brussels.MPs pushing the anti-backstop amendments will be competing against a rival bloc of parliamentarians hoping to get a majority for an amendment intended to prevent the government taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. Various versions of this are on the order paper, including some viewed with alarm by ministers because they cede control of the parliamentary timetable to backbenchers.Last week there were reports claiming that dozens of pro-European ministers might resign if ordered to vote against the most robust anti no-deal amendment, tabled by Labour’s Yvette Cooper.Those threats seem to have faded but, according to the Telegraph, pro-European ministers, including the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the justice secretary, David Gauke, held a conference call on Sunday night during which some of them said that the threat to resign could be reactivated if May did not bring a new deal back for a parliamentary vote within a fortnight. They fear that, if May is allowed to delay beyond the middle of February, a no-deal Brexit could become inevitable. In an interview with BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show, Coveney said he did not see the need for further compromise because “the backstop is already a compromise”. Although originally Northern Ireland-specific, it was made UK-wide at the request of May, he said.“And the very need for the backstop in the first place was because of British red lines that they wanted to leave the customs union and single market,” he said.“So the Irish position is, look, we have already agreed to a series of compromises here, and that has resulted in what is proposed in the withdrawal agreement. Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, when we say that the backstop, as part of the withdrawal agreement, is part of a balanced package that isn’t going to change.”Ireland has repeatedly stressed its commitment to retaining the backstop. But since May’s deal was rejected this month in the Commons by an unprecedented majority of 230, some ministers claim to have picked up signs that other members of the EU may be inclined to compromise on this in order to avert a no-deal Brexit.Responding to Coveney’s interview, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, dismissed suggestions it had sabotaged May’s Brexit strategy for the coming week, saying all sides were looking for “pragmatic solutions” to the Irish border problem.Hancock also played down a report claiming that, as part of government planning for a no-deal Brexit, officials had been looking at the possible need to introduce martial law to cope with civil disorder. Under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, sweeping powers are available to the government for use in emergencies, but Hancock said that, while governments have to look at all options, martial law was “not specifically” being looked at.In a further development on Monday the Commons Brexit committee published a report suggesting that the government was being too complacent about how the negative consequences of a no-deal Brexit might be contained.“While the EU might agree to side deals to mitigate the worst of the disruption of a no-deal outcome, this cannot be guaranteed, and we are concerned by the extent to which assumptions of an ongoing cooperative relationship underpin the government’s no-deal planning,” said the report, which was approved by a majority of the committee after five Brexiter members voted against.“Since these assumptions cannot be guaranteed, a ‘managed no deal’ cannot constitute the policy of any responsible government,” the report went on.Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: “Having taken a wide range of evidence on the implications of a no-deal Brexit, the committee is clear that this cannot be allowed to happen.“It would disrupt supply chains, create costs and uncertainty for businesses, threaten the reintroduction of tariffs and new non-tariff barriers which would affect competitiveness and many small businesses are not ready because they don’t know what to plan for.”",Blow for May as Ireland stresses it will not yield on Brexit backstop,2019-01-28/00:00:05+0000,ireland has launched a last minute

bloc of parliamentarians hoping to get a majority for an amendment intended to prevent the government taking the uk out of the eu without a deal various versions of this are on the order paper including some viewed with alarm by ministers because they cede control of the parliamentary timetable to backbenchers last week there were reports claiming that dozens of pro european ministers might resign if ordered to vote against the most robust anti no deal amendment tabled by labour s yvette cooper those threats seem to have faded but according to the telegraph pro european ministers including the work and pensions secretary amber rudd the business secretary greg clark and the justice secretary david gauke held a conference call on sunday night during which some of them said that the threat to resign could be reactivated if may did not bring a new deal back for a parliamentary vote within a fortnight they fear that if may is allowed to delay beyond the middle of february a no deal brexit could become inevitable in an interview with bbc one s the andrew marr show coveney said he did not see the need for further compromise because the backstop is already a compromise although originally northern ireland specific it was made uk wide at the request of may he said and the very need for the backstop in the first place was because of british red lines that they wanted to leave the customs union and single market he said so the irish position is look we have already agreed to a series of compromises here and that has resulted in what is proposed in the withdrawal

5662,"French businesses working with British contractors or suppliers should now be actively seeking out alternatives, the French government has said, as it further ramped up preparations for a no-deal Brexit that it sees as increasingly likely.“Let’s not panic, but let’s prepare for different scenarios,” the Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseau, said on Friday as she unveiled a 28-page booklet for companies with British ties, which advises them to adopt the UK’s wartime motto and “keep calm and carry on”.Companies reliant on UK business partners should explore other options outside Britain, while those with UK-based operations in specific EU-regulated sectors such as pharmaceuticals should think about moving them to the continent, the guidance saysLast week France triggered a €50m (£44m) plan for no-deal after the UK parliament overwhelmingly rejected Theresa May’s proposed deal. The French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said there were now “strong fears” that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal on 29 March.The government authorised new infrastructure spending on border checkpoints, roads, lorry parks and warehousing at ports and airports and is hiring 750 extra staff, including customs officials and veterinary and standards inspectors, to carry out checks on goods, livestock and food products.Agnès Pannier-Runacher, the junior economy and finance minister, said on Friday that France was “hoping for the best but planning for the worst”, and that no-deal would plunge the country into an “unprecedented situation with a major trading partner”.The risk of no deal had “significantly increased”, she said. “There is absolutely no time left to lose for these companies. The countdown has well and truly started.”The booklet says French firms with financial services contracts in the UK should think about switching them to an EU27 country and consider what to do with confidential data currently stored in Britain. Those with UK-based employees should start thinking about possible social security issues and consider hiring temporary staff. It also suggests that French companies working with UK partners on programmes funded by the EU should start searching elsewhere for collaborators.As many as 30,000 French companies export to the UK, and 3,300 have British-based operations, according to government figures. French officials plan to hold around 30 meetings around the country to help small businesses in particular prepare for all possible forms of Brexit.Loiseau said Paris would of course be looking for a “close and mutually beneficial” relationship with Britain after Brexit, but deal or no deal, it would necessarily be one that was “downgraded” from its current status.“There is no relationship more simple, more profitable, more complete – between businesses, between citizens – than being a member of the European Union,” she said.",French firms with UK ties told to look for alternatives as Brexit looms,2019-01-25/19:30:36+0000,french businesses working with british contractors or suppliers should now be actively seeking out alternatives the french government has said as it further ramped up preparations for a no deal brexit that it sees as increasingly likely let s not panic but let s prepare for different scenarios the europe minister nathalie loiseau said on friday as she unveiled a  page booklet for companies with british ties which advises them to adopt the uk s wartime motto and keep calm and carry on companies reliant on uk business partners should explore other options outside britain while those with uk based operations in specific eu regulated sectors such as pharmaceuticals should think about moving them to the continent the guidance sayslast week france triggered a m m plan for no deal after the uk parliament overwhelmingly rejected theresa may s proposed deal the french prime minister edouard philippe said there were now strong fears that britain could crash out of the eu without a deal on  march the government authorised new infrastructure spending on border checkpoints roads lorry parks and warehousing at ports and airports and is hiring  extra staff including customs officials and veterinary and standards inspectors to carry out checks on goods livestock and food products agnès pannier runacher the junior economy and finance minister said on friday that france was hoping for the best but planning for the worst and that no deal would plunge the country into an unprecedented situation with a major trading partner the risk of no deal had significantly increased she said there is absolutely no time left to lose for these companies the countdown has well and truly started the booklet says french firms with financial services contracts in the uk should think about switching them to an eu country and consider what to do with confidential data currently stored in britain those with uk based employees should start thinking about possible social security issues and consider hiring temporary staff it also suggests that french companies working with uk partners on programmes funded by the eu should start searching elsewhere for collaborators as many as   french companies export to the uk and   have british based operations according to government figures french officials plan to hold around  meetings around the country to help small businesses in particular prepare for all possible forms of brexit loiseau said paris would of course be looking for a close and mutually beneficial relationship with britain after brexit but deal or no deal it would necessarily be one that was downgraded from its current status there is no relationship more simple more profitable more complete between businesses between citizens than being a member of the european union she said ,Brexit,0.212154284
5766,"Ireland will have 400 new customs officers in place by the end of March as it rushes to put no-deal measures in place to keep trade moving with Great Britain, according to an unpublished document from the Irish tax authority.Niall Cody, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, will reveal the scale of no-deal contingency operations for the first time on Thursday, warning of the adverse impact for 70,000 Irish small to medium-sized businesses that trade with the UK.“We have accelerated and expanded our recruitment and training schedules to meet the end of March deadline [for Brexit],” he will tell a parliamentary committee.But the Republic says it will not be putting any customs posts on the border with Northern Ireland. “The government has made clear that the overriding objective is to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Revenue is not planning for customs post,” Cody will say.“The government has indicated that in the event of no deal, it will engage in intensive discussions with the EU commission and our EU partners will provide whatever technical expertise and assistance may be required during this process.”His comments come after the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said in the event of no deal the EU “will have to find an operational way of carrying out checks and controls without putting back in place a border”.It seemed to backpedal on earlier claims that no deal would lead to a hard border, raising questions about the lack of a clear definition of that term, and the absence of no-deal planning papers in the public domain from the UK, Ireland or the EU in relation to the most contentious issue in the Brexit deal.During 2017, 84,000 Irish businesses traded with the UK and about half of those, 45,000, were regular traders. Only 17,000 businesses in Ireland currently trade with third countries, requiring 1.6m customs import and export declarations to be processed.“Post Brexit, import and export declarations could increase to as many as 20m per annum,” Cody will say on Thursday. This is because the UK will be classified as a third country from 30 March in the event of a no deal.The Labour TD and former deputy prime minister of Ireland Joan Burton said this would spell chaos not just for Ireland but for the UK as well. “I think that finally we are being honest about what happens if the UK leaves the customs union and the free movement of goods ends until alternative arrangements are made,” she said.“If Ireland has to deal with 20m import and export declarations and we are a small country, just think of the number of import and export declarations the UK will have to cope with with France, the Netherlands, Germany, all 27 countries.”Burton said infrastructure on the Northern Ireland border was in “nobody’s interest including the unionist community”.",Ireland hires 400 new customs officials in case of no-deal Brexit,2019-01-23/19:47:07+0000,ireland will have  new customs officers in place by the end of march as it rushes to put no deal measures in place to keep trade moving with great britain according to an unpublished document from the irish tax authority niall cody the chairman of the revenue commissioners will reveal the scale of no deal contingency operations for the first time on thursday warning of the adverse impact for   irish small to medium sized businesses that trade with the uk we have accelerated and expanded our recruitment and training schedules to meet the end of march deadline for brexit he will tell a parliamentary committee but the republic says it will not be putting any customs posts on the border with northern ireland the government has made clear that the overriding objective is to avoid a hard border on the island of ireland revenue is not planning for customs post cody will say the government has indicated that in the event of no deal it will engage in intensive discussions with the eu commission and our eu partners will provide whatever technical expertise and assistance may be required during this process his comments come after the eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier said in the event of no deal the eu will have to find an operational way of carrying out checks and controls without putting back in place a border it seemed to backpedal on earlier claims that no deal would lead to a hard border raising questions about the lack of a clear definition of that term and the absence of no deal planning papers in the public domain from the uk ireland or the eu in relation to the most contentious issue in the brexit deal during    irish businesses traded with the uk and about half of those   were regular traders only   businesses in ireland currently trade with third countries requiring  m customs import and export declarations to be processed post brexit import and export declarations could increase to as many as m per annum cody will say on thursday this is because the uk will be classified as a third country from  march in the event of a no deal the labour td and former deputy prime minister of ireland joan burton said this would spell chaos not just for ireland but for the uk as well i think that finally we are being honest about what happens if the uk leaves the customs union and the free movement of goods ends until alternative arrangements are made she said if ireland has to deal with m import and export declarations and we are a small country just think of the number of import and export declarations the uk will have to cope with with france the netherlands germany all  countries burton said infrastructure on the northern ireland border was in nobody s interest including the unionist community ,Brexit,0.302670151
5790,"Jeremy Corbyn has accused Theresa May of closing down solutions to the Brexit impasse by refusing to countenance customs union membership or to rule out no deal, saying these could command majority support in the Commons.Again using all his time at prime minister’s questions to focus on the stalled Brexit strategy, Corbyn argued that May’s promise to liaise with other parties was meaningless if she declined to abandon any of her red lines.“It appears that while the door to her office may be open, apparently the minds inside it are completely closed,” the Labour leader said, borrowing a line used by one of his MPs, Hilary Benn, earlier in the week.In response, May lambasted Corbyn for being the only opposition party leader to refuse to discuss Brexit with her in person, and mocked his demand for a future customs union with the EU as vague.Before a slightly subdued Commons, which has witnessed similar exchanges numerous times in recent weeks, Corbyn began by noting reported comments from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to business leaders, reassuring them a no-deal departure would not happen.“So will the prime minister listen to her own cabinet members and take no deal off the table?” Corbyn asked.After arguing that the only way to rule out no deal was to pass her deal, May queried Corbyn’s decision to not join her for discussions: “The right honourable gentleman has been willing to sit down with Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA without preconditions, yet he won’t meet me to talk about Brexit.”Corbyn replied: “The only consistency in her strategy seems to be running down the clock on this by threatening no deal as an alternative to her dead deal.”In later exchanges about a post-Brexit customs union, which Labour wants, May declined explicitly to rule this out, but mainly because she answered Corbyn’s question by mocking what he said was Labour’s vagueness as to the details of this.“If he won’t talk about it there’s only one conclusion: he hasn’t got a clue,” she said. May added later: “The right honourable gentleman is doing what he always does: he just stands up, uses these phrases, and the honest answer is I don’t think he knows what those phrases mean or what the implications of those phrases are.”Corbyn said the government was in chaos over Brexit, highlighting the previous promise by Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, that dozens of new trade agreements would be in place “the second after Brexit”.He said: “Why is the prime minister prepared to sell people’s jobs and living standards down the river rather than negotiate a customs union that would be part of a sensible deal for the future?“While a third of her government are at the billionaires’ jamboree in Davos, she says she’s listening, but rules out changes on the two issues where there might be a majority – against no deal, and for a customs union, part of Labour’s sensible alternative.“If the prime minister is serious about finding a solution, which of her red lines is she prepared to abandon? Could she name a single one?”May replied: “He makes claims about minds being closed; he asks about red lines.

5853,"The Derry bombing this weekend is a stark reminder of what is at stake in Northern Ireland with Brexit: decades of peace where arguments are settled with words not weapons. In reopening the question of whether the physical border between the North and South of Ireland might return, Brexit threatens to turn back the clock to a far more dangerous era. That past, where symbols summon deadly emotions, has been revived by English nationalists in the Tory party who appear comfortably ignorant of the Troubles. Erasing the border in Ireland, once dotted with watchtowers and checkpoints, was necessary. But Brexit put the deadly issues of the Irish border and sovereignty back into mainstream debate. Dissident republicans have been blamed by the police for the van bomb attack on a Derry courthouse. Their ideological patrons have long recognised Brexit’s potential to reignite the conflict, with one quoted in academic Marisa McGlinchey’s new study Unfinished Business as saying it was “the best chance we’ve had since 1916”.That is why Theresa May and the European Union committed to avoiding the return of a “hard border” – physical checks or infrastructure – after Brexit. The UK and Ireland are currently part of the EU single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected. To maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal, Mrs May and the EU said it was necessary to have a backstop arrangement that will allow for frictionless trade. The trouble is that the Democratic Unionist party is divided over how to deal with this insurance policy. The party’s “blood red line” of no border down the Irish Sea means it could accept only the hardest or softest of Brexits. Hence Mrs May continues to talk to the DUP in the hope that the party will make up its mind.The prime minister ought to have realised months ago that the hard Brexit faction within the DUP has its power base in Westminster. It first asserted itself after power-sharing in Northern Ireland collapsed. It became dominant after Mrs May sought DUP support for her parliamentary majority in Westminster in the wake of the 2017 election. The suspended Stormont assembly provided a forum for sane debate: in August 2016 the DUP’s Arlene Foster signed a joint letter with Sinn Féin’s Martin McGuinness on safeguarding the gains of the peace process and the need to protect “the border [issue], the all-island energy market, EU peace funding and the need to maintain tariff- and barrier-free trade with the EU”.To win support for her deal, Mrs May must seek to revive such sentiments not just within Ms Foster’s party but also within the wider nationalist community. Efforts in this direction won’t be helped by former cabinet ministers ludicrously suggesting that Brexit would have been resolved if not for splits in the Irish government, or that the UK government should simply wait for the EU to dump Dublin in favour of London. The withdrawal agreement already has a provision for Britain to choose whether to enter the backstop or extend the transition. What Mrs May also needs to do urgently is win back the nationalist community and the growing band of Northern Irish non-tribal voters. Departing the EU could see Brexit become synonymous with defending the province’s place within the UK. The risk to unionism is voters could then reassess their constitutional preference. Few want a hard border; they should not block ways to avoid one. Electoral contingency and political expediency cannot be allowed to break up the UK.",The Guardian view on Brexit and Ireland: a danger to peace,2019-01-21/18:57:35+0000,the derry bombing this weekend is a stark reminder of what is at stake in northern ireland with brexit decades of peace where arguments are settled with words not weapons in reopening the question of whether the physical border between the north and south of ireland might return brexit threatens to turn back the clock to a far more dangerous era that past where symbols summon deadly emotions has been revived by english nationalists in the tory party who appear comfortably ignorant of the troubles erasing the border in ireland once dotted with watchtowers and checkpoints was necessary but brexit put the deadly issues of the irish border and sovereignty back into mainstream debate dissident republicans have been blamed by the police for the van bomb attack on a derry courthouse their ideological patrons have long recognised brexit s potential to reignite the conflict with one quoted in academic marisa mcglinchey s new study unfinished business as saying it was the best chance we ve had since  that is why theresa may and the european union committed to avoiding the return of a hard border physical checks or infrastructure after brexit the uk and ireland are currently part of the eu single market and customs union so products do not need to be inspected to maintain an open border on the island of ireland in the event that the uk leaves the eu without securing an all encompassing deal mrs may and the eu said it was necessary to have a backstop arrangement that will allow for frictionless trade the trouble is that the democratic unionist party is divided over how to deal with this insurance policy the party s blood red line of no border down the irish sea means it could accept only the hardest or softest of brexits hence mrs may continues to talk to the dup in the hope that the party will make up its mind the prime minister ought to have realised months ago that the hard brexit faction within the dup has its power base in westminster it first asserted itself after power sharing in northern ireland collapsed it became dominant after mrs may sought dup support for her parliamentary majority in westminster in the wake of the  election the suspended stormont assembly provided a forum for sane debate in august  the dup s arlene foster signed a joint letter with sinn féin s martin mcguinness on safeguarding the gains of the peace process and the need to protect the border issue the all island energy market eu peace funding and the need to maintain tariff and barrier free trade with the eu to win support for her deal mrs may must seek to revive such sentiments not just within ms foster s party but also within the wider nationalist community efforts in this direction won t be helped by former cabinet ministers ludicrously suggesting that brexit would have been resolved if not for splits in the irish government or that the uk government should simply wait for the eu to dump dublin in favour of london the withdrawal agreement already has a provision for britain to choose whether to enter the backstop or extend the transition what mrs may also needs to do urgently is win back the nationalist community and the growing band of northern irish non tribal voters departing the eu could see brexit become synonymous with defending the province s place within the uk the risk to unionism is voters could then reassess their constitutional preference few want a hard border they should not block ways to avoid one electoral contingency and political expediency cannot be allowed to break up the uk ,Brexit,0.221302822
5875,"Work has begun at the Calais Eurotunnel exit for a new border inspection post for horses and other large animals as part of a £20m no-deal contingency plan.Controls are also being prepared at the nearby port of Boulogne to cater for the 200,000 tonnes of fish the UK exports through France.The plans are part of Brexit preparations launched by the French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, in Calais on Friday, in response to more than a year’s campaigning by the region’s president, Xavier Bertrand.Digging has already begun at Coquelles, the site of the Eurotunnel exit, with funds contributed by its parent company, Getlink.Ici, le 30 mars, il y aura un poste de contrôle douanier et vétérinaire en sortie de tunnel sous la manche. « C’est tendu, mais on est motivé » affirme Jacques Gounon, pdg d’eurotunnel. pic.twitter.com/kMBnv6neQcUnder EU rules, animals, fresh food and agri-feed from Britain will be classified as being from a “third country” post Brexit, with checks for disease, traceability, rules of origin and welfare mandatory on the French side.And although work has yet to start, land for a temporary border inspection post involving customs and sanitary checks has been commandeered at the Transmark fuel stop in Calais off the A16, the main artery between the town and Dunkirk.Planning for border operations on the British side of the Channel is less advanced because of the continuing uncertainty over the possibility of no deal.The UK transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has also declared that there would be no border checks at Dover when Britain leaves the EU in March, calling controls “utterly unrealistic”.However, the French believe this is not a sustainable position in the long term and are anticipating that checks could be needed eventually by Britain, but because of land limitations in Dover and Kent these may have to be done in Calais.“We are planning not just for day one but day 30, day 90,” said a spokesman for Bertrand.With the haulage industry dominated by eastern European companies, Bertrand also expressed concern that if Britain crashes out of the EU, there should be a plan to communicate to drivers who do not speak English or French.“To protect the SME/VSE sector and tourism and avoid congestion in the ports and tunnel, we must urgently conduct an information campaign [aimed at] logistics professionals from across Europe on new customs rules if there is no agreement,” he said in a tweet.Some British lorry drivers who frequently use the Calais-Dover route told the Guardian they were unconcerned about checks.“I do wine imports and all imports need documentation at the moment so that they can transit from France to a bonded warehouse in Britain,” said driver Dominic Salvatori.“I’m not overly worried because I think the tariff system would be very heavily based on sender/receiver honesty and coming down hard on lack of compliance,” he said.If there isn’t smuggling of dodgy or dangerous goods on a large scale now, why would there be post-Brexit, is the logic of Salvatori and one of his fellow drivers, Jon Slack.“Everything we carry has barcodes, is scanned and tracked,” said Slack, who takes medical equipment such as scalpels, scrapers and cutters from Sheffield to Aix-en-Provence.“The load on the way back may come from Spain or somewhere, but there is GPS on the lorries and a lot of companies are informed when their load goes on the lorry.

5950,"Having asked those of you living outside the UK if you were confused by the latest news from Brexitland, I got so many responses (thank you all) that I have grouped and paraphrased the most common ones so as to be able answer, at least approximately, as many as possible.And I’ve mostly stuck to factual questions on the Brexit process. “Will Brexit finally teach Britain it no longer rules the world?” from (among others) Steve Norman in Canada, Ferdy in Dublin and Thijs in the Netherlands, warrants a book-length response, but not now.Also, I’m not going into great detail explaining Brexit terminology: if you want answers to that I recommend the Guardian’s handy Brexit phrasebook which hopefully has most of it covered.What are the ground rules of Brexit? I’m seriously confused (Danni, US)Brexit is the process of the UK leaving the EU, which it narrowly voted in favour of in a referendum in June 2016. The process is governed by article 50 of the EU’s Treaty of Lisbon and is happening in two stages: first, the two sides negotiate their divorce deal (the “withdrawal agreement”), and after this they will sort out their future trading relationship. It’s proving problematic because the UK voted for a departure but not a destination: some think Britain should remain in a close relationship with the EU, with privileged access to its vast single market but having to obey its rules; others think its should strike out on its own, with greater control but less smooth trade. It’s complicated by the red lines set down by the prime minister, Theresa May, (ending the automatic right of EU citizens to settle in the UK, and leaving the EU’s single market and customs union) which exclude a lot of potential options.Can you explain the Irish backstop? (Diane Dalton, US, with related questions from Ton Pasman and Leonie, Netherlands; Shona, Ireland; Dietmar Homberg, Germany; Elisabeth Sanfuchs, Belgium; Ayaz Ramji, Canada)When the UK leaves the EU, the border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland, which is currently invisible, will become the EU’s only land border with the UK. Such a border normally requires customs and other controls. Nobody wants that, partly because nobody wants a return to the violence of the period before the Good Friday agreement, which removed border checks. In theory, the post-Brexit trading arrangements between the EU and the UK will avoid a “hard” border, but they could take years to negotiate so the EU has insisted on a “backstop” guaranteeing the absence of a hard border until those arrangements are in place. The backstop leaves the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU “unless and until” the EU agrees it can leave. Brexiters do not like this at all.Why is the deadline 29 March 2019 and what’s the problem with extending it? (Dawn, Canada; Jean Vigoureux, France)Article 50 provides for two years of talks; the UK triggered it on 29 March 2017 so in principle it leaves automatically two years later. It can ask the EU27 for an extension, which they have said they would grant for a valid reason, such as sorting out the final details of a deal that has the support of a majority in the UK parliament. This now looks quite likely, but it may only last for a few months because a new European parliament is sworn in in July and EU rules require all member states to be represented – a problem if the UK is still a member. Experts think this could be resolved with a temporary fix, but the EU would rather avoid the hassle.Can article 50 be revoked and how would the EU respond? (Benjamin Willumsen, Chile)The European court of justice has ruled that the UK can revoke article 50 unilaterally at any time without the permission of the EU27 (who would be delighted, if annoyed by all the UK has put them through). There’s disagreement in the UK about whether it could be done by a simple vote by MPs or would need an act of parliament, but in any case it looks like the last thing the government would do.Is there any chance of another referendum? (Michael Kerr, California; Johannes Meigen, Germany; David French, New Zealand; Laurent, France)There isn’t a majority in parliament for a “people’s vote”, or second referendum, which both the Tory and Labour leaderships argue would undermine people’s faith in democracy. That could change, but one of the problems is the time it could take to organise another vote: the government says it would take a year, which is an exaggeration, but it would almost certainly take longer than the UK has left, and possibly longer than the relatively short extension likely to be favoured by the EU.What is Labour’s position and why? Why does Jeremy Corbyn think he can negotiate a different or better deal with the EU than Theresa May? (Fernando Hervas, Belgium; Antje, Switzerland)Labour’s position is complicated by the fact that under the UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system, many of its MPs represent constituencies that voted to leave while most of its members and voters are pro-remain. Corbyn himself is also far from being a convinced pro-European. The party has sat on the fence until now – favouring a general election before all other options – but will soon have to come off it. If the EU agrees to rewrite parts of the withdrawal agreement, Labour could get a better deal than May if it dropped (some of) her red lines, but it has been as guilty as the Conservatives of pretending that Britain can leave the EU while retaining all the advantages of membership.Have any trade deals been approved with non-EU nations? What are World Trade Organization terms, and why are they a bad thing? (Patrick Speer, Scotland and Liam, Australia)Britain is not formally allowed to negotiate new trade deals while still an EU member. It has signed off on a text said to replicate current trading arrangements with Switzerland. Other than that, hardly any of the 68 trade deals from which the UK benefits as an EU member, and which it said it would have replicated by the time of departure, are near, and none will be ready by 29 March, according to the FT. Brexiters talk about “trading on WTO terms” as if it is what the world does, but it does not: it may trade under WTO rules, but all 164 members of the WTO have also agreed bilateral or regional trade deals that allow them to trade on much better terms than the WTO baselines. No sensible nation would leave the world’s largest single market, the EU, to trade with it on WTO terms, as would happen in the event of no deal.What might happen in the the first weeks and months after a no-deal Brexit? I’m travelling to Britain in April – will my trip be disrupted, might there be food shortages? (Mark Singer and Gerry Patey, Canada; Francois Bry, Munich; Jean Ballanco, US)As far as food shortages go, it’s anyone’s guess. Major British supermarket chains have started stockpiling tinned goods and MPs have said Britons may need to adopt a different diet, which does not sound promising, but it’s hard to imagine it coming to that. No deal would certainly be likely to cause disruption at airports; the European commission last month unveiled a temporary nine-month plan to keep planes in the air and goods and money flowing should the UK crash out, and Britain has the army standing by, but an awful lot of things we take for granted could change very suddenly if Britain leaves without a deal. British visitors to Europe will need to apply for an online visa waiver, similar to the the US Esta programme, once it comes into operation in 2020; if the UK crashes out before then, they may – depending on how the UK decides to treat EU visitors – require a Schengen area visa.Does the Queen have any powers to intervene? (Vincent, Netherlands; Isabel Pitta, Brazil)The monarch is not meant to get involved in politics. But she is the only person who can invite someone to form a government, and if Theresa May loses another no-confidence vote, she might have to. She would have 14 days to ask someone to form a new administration (including a cross-party option) providing it was clear they could command a majority in parliament. If no majority exists, new elections would automatically follow. The Queen, however, cannot dissolve parliament, having lost this power in the 2011 Fixed-term Parliament Act.Will my daughter, who is French, need to apply for a visa to study in the UK? Will we need international driver’s licences? (K Joubert, France; Michael Lea, Spain)European students currently studying in the UK or applying to start courses in 2019 will not face any additional restrictions because of Brexit, the government has said. It has warned, however, that UK drivers living in the EU should exchange their licence for a local one – and if possible get an international driving permit – as soon as possible in case of a no-deal Brexit, which might invalidate their UK licence, or mean they have to take a new driving test.How do you get out of this mess? When will all the turmoil be over – aren’t you going insane? (Remo Casale, New Zealand; Georg Beck, Germany)In order:By the British government softening its red lines to allow it to arrive at a form of Brexit that is acceptable to both the EU27 and the UK

6005,"When all solutions are bad, it’s time to reinvent the problem. Is it still possible to honour the initial Brexit referendum without crossing the EU’s red lines? Yes – through semi-Brexit.The UK is divided into four nations, two of which voted remain and two of which voted leave. The British government could honour those decisions and allow Scotland and Northern Ireland to remain in the EU as the successor state to the UK, while permitting England and Wales (if it still wants to) to exit.Semi-Brexit does not mean breaking up the UK. Rather the reverse: semi-Brexit may be the only way to hold the UK together. If the UK drags Scotland and Northern Ireland out of the EU, the chances of a UK breakup are much higher. But if Scotland and Northern Ireland remain, then England and Wales would have more flexibility to negotiate a better deal. Third states – that is, states outside the EU – cannot cherry-pick the bits of the EU that they want and reject those bits they don’t. But parts of EU member states that are otherwise outside the EU can.At least 35 countries and territories already have special deals with the EU that include, for example, free movement of goods into the EU without triggering the free movement of EU nationals back. Or deals that include something close to free trade without the jurisdiction of the European court of justice (ECJ). And on and on and on. The combinations of inside-EU privileges with extra-EU independence are very nearly endless. And they already exist.There’s just one catch: the territories that get to cherry-pick from the EU in these ways must remain constitutionally attached to a current EU member state. From “outermost regions” (nine of them) to “overseas territories” (25 of them) to bespoke agreements with the EU on the part of special regions (a half dozen or so), far-flung – and not so far-flung – territories have worked out special arrangements with the EU through their associated member state.One does not have to look far to see how. The Isle of Man has free trade with the EU for agricultural and manufactured products but is otherwise not bound by EU law. Guernsey has free trade in goods more generally, but no EU nationals have free movement rights into Guernsey. In fact, the array of models one could use for a bespoke deal for England and Wales is nearly endless. But getting these options requires part of the UK to stay in the EU.How would this be possible? The EU law questions are relatively easy while the heavy lifting, legally speaking, falls to UK constitutional law. The ECJ has just held that the UK can halt article 50 unilaterally. By doing that, the UK could put its negotiations with the EU on a different track.Of course, the EU wouldn’t tolerate an open-ended Brexit process wreaking havoc with long-term planning. The EU would have to know soon how to figure the UK into its parliamentary election cycle in 2019 and new budget cycle shortly after that. If, however, the UK were to announce that Scotland and Northern Ireland were staying in the EU while England and Wales exited, then the number of MEPs the new UK should elect in the new European parliament follows a formula. Ditto with the budget contribution. With these adjustments, the EU could go ahead and plan its future.Once the UK’s parameters in Europe were settled, the EU could begin negotiations with England and Wales over a new long-term relationship. The EU framework for special territories has no draconian deadlines – by contrast with the short deadlines of article 50.The harder transitional questions fall in UK constitutional law. The Westminster parliament would have to give the four nations the power to make international agreements in their own name so that each could remain a member of the EU (or not) separately. All subject areas covered by EU law would have to be devolved from Westminster to the four nations so that they could ensure harmonisation of their laws with EU law (or not).In the current UK constitution, however, the four nations are not equal: England would have to acquire its own parliament to receive the devolution. This idea has been well mooted already so plans are already available. In fact, the creation of an English parliament would bring self-government home even more dramatically than Brexiteers promised.Beyond that, there are questions about how to organise borders for whatever would not flow freely between the EU and the part of the UK that left. To control the flow of people, England and Wales could require residency and work permits for foreigners who live and work on its territory while the part of the UK that remained in the EU would allow free movement. UK corporations that wanted the benefits of EU status could reincorporate in Scotland while keeping their current offices in London – and charging a reasonable reincorporation tax would float Scotland’s budget again.In semi-Brexit, England and Wales might be able to negotiate free movement of exports under arrangements similar to those of the Channel Islands. If the EU were unwilling to go that far, however, arrangements for the movement of goods would, under this proposal, at least be displaced from the fraught international border between the UK and Ireland to the less-fraught borders between England and Wales and the rest of the UK. Without the pressing March deadline of article 50, these questions could be resolved in their own time. Perhaps Northern Ireland could even form a government by then.If England and Wales wanted one day to get back into the EU after semi-Brexit, re-entry would be easier than if the whole UK left. A single unanimous vote of the European council is sufficient for re-entry. In the process of re-entry, England and Wales would not lose all of their special agreements and opt-outs because the remaining UK would retain them.With semi-Brexit, the UK could honour the referendum and allow each part of the UK to get what it voted for. Semi-Brexit would also give the EU a graceful way to provide a better deal for England and Wales. Isn’t semi-Brexit, then, the least worst path forward?• Kim Lane Scheppele is the Laurance S Rockefeller professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University","A semi-Brexit, with

6038,"EU governments and businesses are ramping up their preparations to minimise the chaos and disruption of a no-deal Brexit, which many see as significantly more likely after the crushing defeat of Theresa May’s deal in parliament.With 72 days until the UK is due to leave the EU, France’s Medef business lobby told companies on Wednesday to prepare for a worst-case scenario, saying the vote “had made it quite possible that the UK will leave on 29 March without a deal”.The Dutch prime minister said that time was running out and urged the British to make up their minds. “A no-deal exit is of course worse than with a deal,” Mark Rutte said. “What the Netherlands is doing is trying to ensure that the damage is minimised.”Placing the blame firmly on London, Germany’s BDI business lobby said the vote meant that Britain was getting closer to a disorderly Brexit. With UK-German trade worth €175bn a year, the prospect of a no deal “endangers tens of thousands of companies and hundreds of thousands of jobs in Germany and especially in the UK”, it said. Germany’s carmakers, who sold 800,000 new cars in the UK last year, accounting for 20% of their global exports, were gloomy. “The consequences of a ‘no deal’ would be fatal,” their industry association, VDA, said after the vote, adding: “Jobs in the car industry, particularly on the British side, are on the line.”BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz urged British politicians to create clarity and ensure tariff-free trade can continue. “Uncertainty is not good for business ... We must therefore continue to prepare for the worst-case scenario, which is what a no-deal Brexit would represent,” BMW Group said.[The Belgian government has told businesses and citizens that a no-deal Brexit could lead to the imposition of up to €2.2bn (£1.96bn) in extra tariffs on goods and the loss of more than 40,000 jobs. It intends to present a package of emergency Brexit laws to parliament before the end of February.Belgium’s finance minister, Alexander de Croo, said it was time for the British to finally say what they wanted. “Over the last few months we’ve fallen from one surprise into another,” he said in an interview with De Ochtend. “The only constant is that the British are masters at shooting themselves in the foot and creating associated chaos.” De Croos said only 5,000 of the 25,000 Belgian companies that trade with Britain were ready for the customs checks that could follow Brexit and that the government would from this week “take a more pro-active approach”, allocating all those that were not already registered a customs number.The Spanish government this week launched an online information service for citizens and businesses, including advice on how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. It has also drafted a decree enabling it to enact no-deal contingency provisions drawn up by the European commission.In a statement released shortly after Tuesday’s vote, the Spanish government said it regretted May’s defeat. It said a no-deal exit would have negative consequences for the EU but would be “catastrophic” for the UK.The EU’s executive last month unveiled a temporary nine-month plan – which the bloc can terminate unilaterally – to keep planes in the air and goods and money flowing should the UK crash out.The EU’s executive arm also urged governments to be generous in protecting basic rights for the 1.3 million Britons living in other member states by granting temporary residence permits while they resolved their long-term status.Several, including the Netherlands, Portugal, Poland and the Czech Republic, have done so, with others, including Austria and Sweden, announcing this week that they planned to rush through similar measures as part of omnibus laws.No-deal preparations are most advanced in member states that would be the most severely affected, such as Ireland, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. Dublin last month published its no-deal plans, conceding they were at best “a damage-limitation exercise”, and on Tuesday put forward a 17-part omnibus bill to speed through contingency laws on everything from health to tax and justice.Like most EU countries trading extensively with the UK, Ireland is hiring extra staff – 1,000 in its case – for customs controls, sanitary and phytosanitary checks and export certification. It is also acquiring land near Dublin and Rosslare ports for border inspection bays, truck parks and offices.Last month, Paris passed no-deal legislation that would keep people and freight moving between France and Britain and allow the government to pass emergency laws by decree if necessary to “stabilise” travel, residence, work and welfare issues for British citizens in France.French authorities are hiring an extra 700 customs officers, expanding border control infrastructure such as checkpoints, roads and lorry parks, and building warehouses in Calais, Cherbourg and near the entrance to the Channel tunnel.Germany is hiring an additional 900 customs officials to help ensure the smooth passage of goods, and has passed laws ensuring a limited number of euro financial products, including insurance, will be covered by the EU’s existing passporting regime in the event of no deal.The Netherlands, home to Europe’s largest port in Rotterdam, aims to have hired more than 900 extra customs officials by the end of the year – one-third of them by the time Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March – as well as 150 vets and other scientists for checks on food, plant and animal products.Along with the Belgians, French and Danish, the Dutch have launched comprehensive Brexit impact assessment schemes allowing companies to analyse their specific no-deal risks based on business sector and relationship with the UK.Sweden has identified a dozen or so sectors where the consequences of a no-deal Brexit could be “immediate and serious”, the country’s EU minister, Ann Linde, said last week.",EU states escalate no-deal preparations after May defeat,2019-01-16/10:48:11+0000,eu governments and businesses are ramping up their preparations to minimise the chaos and

6056,"The Irish government has said the country’s medicine supply will be threatened by a no-deal Brexit, with more than half of the 4,000 medicines marketed in Ireland coming from or transiting through the UK.While Westminster lurched towards a widely expected defeat of Theresa May’s Brexit deal, the Irish cabinet was making critical decisions to cope with the potential catastrophic effects of no deal.Ministers in Dublin heard that about 60-70% of medicines in Ireland came via the UK and the supply of some of these may be vulnerable if the UK crashes out of the EU.These included medicines with a short shelf life, special storage and transportation requirements and those with single supplier reliance, the government said in a statement after the cabinet meeting.The Department of Health said it did “not anticipate an immediate impact on medicine supplies” as there were additional supply stocks routinely built into the Irish supply chain. The government has also been planning a fast-tracking of essential drugs into Ireland to deal with “any delays and shortages”.The update gives a glimpse of the scale of the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Ireland, with some predicting the impact could be even greater than in the UK.The cabinet decided to push through a 17-part “omnibus” bill to “mitigate some of the most damaging effects of a no-deal Brexit”, covering trade, tax, health, jobs and policing and security.The deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said: “A no-deal Brexit will have a significant impact on Ireland. These measures being taken by the government are designed to limit the damage. It remains our view that the only way to secure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify the withdrawal agreement.”NEW: While Westminster debate continues Irish cabinet has today agreed to put forward one omnibus bill to speed no deal contingencies laws through.

6082,"The UK’s national daily newspapers have played a key role in shaping the debate on Brexit. This is what they have said in their editorial columns – and on Tuesday’s front pages – regarding Theresa May’s deal with Brussels on leaving the EU.The SunTomorrow's front page: Prince Harry reveals he meditates every day pic.twitter.com/VLFdbwr8tXThe Sun is highly critical of Theresa May’s deal but has so far stopped short of formally endorsing a no-deal exit from the EU.Instead, it has suggested that any attempt by remainers to pursue a softer Brexit would be seen as a betrayal of the EU referendum result, cause the government to collapse, and give control of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn’s “anti-western Marxist rabble”.“If this remainer-stuffed government nullifies or destroys Brexit they can kiss goodbye to their jobs and their party,” the paper’s editorial said last week.On Tuesday, the paper kicks the can a little further down the road, choosing to focus on a suggestion the prime minister believes she could force a second vote if she loses. Notably, the story is not the most prominent on the Sun’s front.Daily MailTuesday’s Daily MAIL: “Time To Put Your Country First” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/2IaSnnaEcOSince remain-supporting Geordie Greig took over the editorship from Paul Dacre in September, the Daily Mail has stuck closely to the Downing Street line on Brexit and backed May’s deal with Brussels as a solution to the “looming shambles” of a no-deal exit. The newspaper has repeatedly warned against attempts to overturn the result while insisting a Corbyn government is the real threat to Britain’s future.The front of Tuesday’s edition is dominated by a clarion call – not an uncommon occurrence for the paper when the stakes are high – for MPs to back the “imperfect” deal. It is time to focus on other matters, the paper says, denouncing the parlous state of some of the country’s public services and infrastructure.Greig’s former paper, the Mail on Sunday, has taken a pro-Brexit stance under its new editor, Ted Verity, albeit making it clear that “we cannot leave without a deal”.Daily TelegraphThe front page of tomorrow's Daily Telegraph 'Out of allies, out of time' #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/fsLVe4vultThe pro-Brexit newspaper owned by the Barclay brothers has been strongly critical of May’s deal, warning that any attempt to delay Britain’s exit from the EU would result in political radicalisation and a possible Corbyn government. On Tuesday, the paper is another to carry an editorial on its front, albeit only a short extract, in which it says it regrets having to oppose a Tory prime minister, but feels it has no choice. It would be a “historic mistake” to endorse this “dreadful deal”, the paper says.Its sister paper, the Sunday Telegraph, went further, describing it as an “appalling, misconceived” proposal: “Not only should MPs vote against the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, but they must vote against it in large enough numbers to kill it dead, otherwise Theresa May will just keep bringing it back to the Commons until she gets her way.”The TimesTuesday’s TIMES: “May braced for historic defeat on Brexit D-Day” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/KhtElh3OTcThe newspaper backed remain during the referendum but is now firmly behind May’s deal as a way of avoiding a chaotic exit at the end of March.“Her deal is not perfect but it would allow Britain to make an orderly withdrawal from the EU,” its editorial said on Monday, citing the commitment to guaranteeing citizens’ rights and meeting existing financial obligations. But its splash acknowledges May is expected to suffer a heavy defeat.The GuardianGuardian front page, Tuesday 15 January 2019: May facing crushing defeat in Brexit vote pic.twitter.com/1qBc7PAd34The Guardian has described the prime minister’s proposal as “a leap of faith, and scarcely more acceptable than no deal at all”, insisting it should be explicitly rejected, with the article 50 process paused and Brexit put on hold.Its editorial said last week: “MPs should then open up the debate to the country: first, by establishing a citizens’ assembly to examine the options and issues that face the nation; and second, by giving parliament the right, if it so chooses, to put these alternatives in a referendum this year or next.”Daily ExpressTuesday’s Daily EXPRESS: “Don’t Lose Our Trust For Ever” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/fAB3UJueOyThe Daily Express is the staunchest backer of Brexit among the national papers but has also been a staunch backer of Theresa May’s deal with Brussels – being rewarded with interviews with the prime minister and additional briefings from Downing Street. The newspaper has said the current proposal is “far from perfect” but is the best offer on the table.“We want hard-nosed pragmatism to win the day,” the paper said, while urging the EU to make further concessions to help the deal pass the House of Commons.Daily MirrorTuesday’s Daily MIRROR: “Plan B” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/uqDCzE7nAEThe Labour-supporting tabloid has trodden a careful line on Brexit, potentially because its readership is split down the middle on the question of leave and remain, according to YouGov polling commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign.It has endorsed the so-called Norway option of close alignment with the EU, believing it to be the least bad form of Brexit. Although the paper will not rule out a second referendum and would like a general election, it does not think the latter is likely in the near future.Financial TimesTuesday’s FINANCIAL TIMES: “Tory Eurosceptics threaten May with humiliation over Brexit deal” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/B5TpyNudPOThe financial paper originally backed Theresa May’s deal, describing it as “imperfect but ultimately pragmatic” – a decision that earned the newspaper criticism from remain campaigners such as Andrew Adonis, who claim it is taking orders from its Japanese owners Nikkei.In France, Libération ran through the post-vote options, concluding with the possibility that “the Queen might run out of Buckingham Palace screaming: ‘Enough is enough.’” Alas, the paper added, this was unlikely.“The Queen does not have the right to intervene in political debate. Officially, she takes no view on Brexit at all. In that regard she is, of all the citizens of this deeply divided country, just about the only one.”The London correspondent of the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad reflected: “Brexit has not advanced a single step … Once, Brexiters promised a glorious future and were believed. Now, after two and a half years of argument, debate and defeats in Brussels, the shine has come off it.“Of course, there are Brits who are worried, angry and disappointed – but there are plenty more who cannot even bear to hear the the B-word. Brexit has become a terrible British family secret, that everyone wants to hush up.”Germany’s Die Zeit asked despairingly: “But where do you want to go?” before explaining: “The difficulty currently in the British parliament is that there is no obvious majority among MPs for any alternative” to May’s deal.El Pais in Spain warned that “unless there is a last-minute surprise, Theresa May is heading for a heavy defeat”. Part of the problem, it said, is that while May’s warnings of the potentially dire consequences of not voting for her deal “seem obvious to any well-informed analyst, to Brexiters they are simply more

6110,"British people living in the EU may have to take new driving tests after a no-deal Brexit if they do not exchange their UK licence for a European one before 29 March, the government has said.In advice issued on Monday focused on driving in the EU after Brexit, the Department for Transport (DfT) tells UK nationals: “In the event that there is no EU exit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in the EU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there.” It warns that as Brexit approaches, there may be delays in processing exchange applications.Short-term visitors could also have to return to the UK to obtain paperwork over a post office counter, with three different types of international driving permit potentially required for British holidaymakers in Europe in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Currently, British driving licence holders can drive in all EU and European Economic Area countries using their normal licence, without a permit.Ireland is the only EU country where British drivers will definitely still be able to travel without additional checks after Brexit, according to the government.Adding to the potential confusion and new rules for British drivers, visitors to France and Spain would also require different types of permits because the two countries ratified different conventions.Drivers with existing international driving permits (IDPs) issued in Britain, which are obtainable through motoring organisations such as the AA or RAC, have either 1949 or 1926 permits.Britain will start issuing a third type, for those countries that have ratified the 1968 convention on road traffic, which will be necessary for most EU member states – although a 1949 version will be needed for Spain, as well as Cyprus, Malta and Iceland.But from the end of January, the permits – which can currently be bought online for £5.50 – will only be obtainable at UK post-office counters.The AA described the situation as “a real mess”. Edmund King, the motoring organisation’s president, said: “Thousands of expats, many of them elderly, will not relish the prospect of having to retake their driving test in a different country and different language if there is no deal.“Drivers without the appropriate IDPs could also be turned back at the ports.

6143,"The archbishop of Canterbury has said a no-deal Brexit would hit the poorest and most vulnerable people in the UK.Justin Welby also said he was praying for Theresa May and other politicians at the start of what is expected to be one of the most tumultuous weeks in recent parliamentary history.Last week, Welby said in the House of Lords that a no-deal Brexit would be “not only a political and practical failure, but a moral one,” and a second referendum may be needed to avoid it.He repeated his concerns in an interview with Christian website Premier, saying: “The burden of proof is on those that are arguing for no deal, to show that it will not harm the poorest and most vulnerable … How we care about them and how our politics affects them is a deeply moral issue.”He added: “Politicians have one of the hardest jobs in the world. It is deeply difficult, and we need to pray for them. It is unbelievably difficult.“When I pray for Theresa May and for all of our politicians, which I do every day … [I pray for] wisdom, courage and strength for them and their families, and for them internally, their psychology, their sense of wellbeing … We entrust them with more responsibility than any of us could cope with.”Welby is known to have voted remain in the 2016 referendum, and has described the EU as “the greatest dream realised for human beings since the fall of the western Roman empire”.But since the referendum he has stressed the need for reconciliation. Supporters of remain and leave must exercise restraint in their language, he has urged. People and political leaders needed to “calm down the hatreds that have arisen over the last few years, [so] that we will move towards reconciliation,” he said last month.Previously he has indicated that he is opposed to a second referendum. But he told the House of Lords last week: “A second referendum is not my preference, but if parliament fails in the task entrusted to it, then regrettably it may be required. This is about more than Brexit, and parliament must not show itself unfit for the job.”A recent opinion poll found that 44% of Britons thought it was inappropriate for the archbishop to offer political opinions, compared with 35% who said it was appropriate.",Justin Welby: no-deal Brexit would harm poorest people in UK,2019-01-14/00:01:23+0000,the archbishop of canterbury has said a no deal brexit would hit the poorest and most vulnerable people in the uk justin welby also said he was praying for theresa may and other politicians at the start of what is expected to be one of the most tumultuous weeks in recent parliamentary history last week welby said in the house of lords that a no deal brexit would be not only a political and practical failure but a moral one and a second referendum may be needed to avoid it he repeated his concerns in an interview with christian website premier saying the burden of proof is on those that are arguing for no deal to show that it will not harm the poorest and most vulnerable how we care about them and how our politics affects them is a deeply moral issue he added politicians have one of the hardest jobs in the world it is deeply difficult and we need to pray for them it is unbelievably difficult when i pray for theresa may and for all of our politicians which i do every day i pray for wisdom courage and strength for them and their families and for them internally their psychology their sense of wellbeing we entrust them with more responsibility than any of us could cope with welby is known to have voted remain in the  referendum and has described the eu as the greatest dream realised for human beings since the fall of the western roman empire but since the referendum he has stressed the need for reconciliation supporters of remain and leave must exercise restraint in their language he has urged people and political leaders needed to calm down the hatreds that have arisen over the last few years so that we will move towards reconciliation he said last month previously he has indicated that he is opposed to a second referendum but he told the house of lords last week a second referendum is not my preference but if parliament fails in the task entrusted to it then regrettably it may be required this is about more than brexit and parliament must not show itself unfit for the job a recent opinion poll found that  of britons thought it was inappropriate for the archbishop to offer political opinions compared with  who said it was appropriate ,Brexit,0.166797057
6145,"The EU is expected to publish a letter of clarification emphasising that any use of the Northern Ireland backstop designed to keep the land border open would only ever be temporary, although it will be a surprise if it makes much difference to the Commons arithmetic.Theresa May will also make a public appeal for support in a speech in Stoke-on-Trent in the morning, while MPs move on to day four of the Brexit debate, with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, closing proceedings. Monday night is the deadline for submitting amendments to the Brexit motion.If May allows it, MPs will finally get to vote on her Brexit deal, although few believe the prime minister can get it approved, given that more than 100 Tory MPs have said they will vote against it.John Bercow, the Speaker, will select which amendments to vote on. The one to watch is the Hilary Benn amendment, which rejects both May’s deal and no deal, and gives MPs a say in what happens next.The prime minister will conclude proceedings, speaking just before voting starts at 7pm. A result on the Benn amendment could come at about 7.30pm. If that falls, the all-important vote on May’s final deal is expected between 8 and 9pm. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, could immediately demand to hold a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, if she is defeated. A heavy loss, and May will face immediate calls to resign.If May were to prevail, business as usual would commence, starting with prime minister’s questions. But the DUP has threatened to abandon its confidence and supply agreement with the government if May’s deal goes through, leaving the Conservatives without an overall majority.A confidence vote could be held on Wednesday, if Corbyn calls for one. It will be hard for Labour to win, because in this scenario, if May’s deal is voted down, the DUP has said it will support the Conservatives in an attempt to get the Brexit deal renegotiated.If May suffers a heavy defeat – perhaps with 80 rebels or more – she may find she is not able to stay on. A more narrow defeat – 40 rebels or fewer – could encourage her to try to ask MPs to vote on the deal again, although it will almost certainly need to be revised first.May could make a dash to Brussels to see if there is any hope of renegotiating. If defeated, she has until the close of business on Monday 21 January to tell MPs what her plan B is; the Commons would then debate and vote on that later in the week.May could seek a general election, which Labour would support, but her own party may not. Soft Brexiters in the Conservative party could break ranks to see if there is majority support for the UK remaining in the customs union, and even the single market.Campaigners for a second referendum see this as their moment to strike: believing that their idea needs to be the last one standing – the only option that could achieve a majority in the house amid a crisis atmosphere.

6153,"The clock might be ticking to Brexit on 29 March, but even if Britain leaves the EU on that date, a “Cornish embassy” will continue to speak out in Brussels.Cornwall council is tendering for a contract for the continued operations of an office in the city “to support our efforts to define our place within the new UK/EU relationship”.About £240,000 has been put aside to support the project, which will cover what is envisaged to be a Brexit transition period.Providing that there is a deal between the UK and the EU, and therefore a transition period, the council states on the tender contract that EU funds will continue to flow until the end of 2023 into Cornwall and Isles of Scilly (CIoS).“Having a Cornwall Brussels office in place will ensure that we have a channel through which we can engage directly with EU stakeholders on funding issues during this period,” it says.A deadline of 11 February has been set for receipt of bids to the council, which is the only local authority in England covering what qualifies under EU rules as a less developed region (LDR).Cornwall had been receiving £80m a year in EU funding, according to the council, money that has gone into jobs, local businesses, infrastructure, training and research. It had been on course to receive about £350m for the next round of funding from the years after 2020.Despite this, Cornwall registered a leave vote of 56.5% during the EU referendum, a result that has mystified some but was explained in recent research by Exeter and Plymouth University as being due to perceptions of the EU as being remote.Liberal Democrat Adam Paynter, the leader of Cornwall council, said: “The EU has been very supportive for us both in terms of infrastructure and growing our economy and our Brussels office has been instrumental in keeping up with calls fro funding. We had a recent vote to keep the office.“Unfortunately the council did not do as it could have done in the past to ensure that people understood the benefits of EU membership and what the structural funds gave us.“That will be an issue for Cornwall – if we ever leave the EU. We have a little way to go but as a council we are working on being self-sufficient because we certainly don’t get the government support that may have been there in the past.”As well as supporting the continuation of the Brussels office, the council also voted to support holding a second referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.",'Cornish embassy' would continue to represent county in EU,2019-01-13/17:15:39+0000,the clock might be ticking to brexit on  march but even if britain leaves the eu on that date a cornish embassy will continue to speak out in brussels cornwall council is tendering for a contract for the continued operations of an office in the city to support our efforts to define our place within the new uk eu relationship about   has been put aside to support the project which will cover what is envisaged to be a brexit transition period providing that there is a deal between the uk and the eu and therefore a transition period the council states on the tender contract that eu funds will continue to flow until the end of  into cornwall and isles of scilly cios having a cornwall brussels office in place will ensure that we have a channel through which we can engage directly with eu stakeholders on funding issues during this period it says a deadline of  february has been set for receipt of bids to the council which is the only local authority in england covering what qualifies under eu rules as a less developed region ldr cornwall had been receiving m a year in eu funding according to the council money that has gone into jobs local businesses infrastructure training and research it had been on course to receive about m for the next round of funding from the years after  despite this cornwall registered a leave vote of   during the eu referendum a result that has mystified some but was explained in recent research by exeter and plymouth university as being due to perceptions of the eu as being remote liberal democrat adam paynter the leader of cornwall council said the eu has been very supportive for us both in terms of infrastructure and growing our economy and our brussels office has been instrumental in keeping up with calls fro funding we had a recent vote to keep the office unfortunately the council did not do as it could have done in the past to ensure that people understood the benefits of eu membership and what the structural funds gave us that will be an issue for cornwall if we ever leave the eu we have a little way to go but as a council we are working on being self sufficient because we certainly don t get the government support that may have been there in the past as well as supporting the continuation of the brussels office the council also voted to support holding a second referendum on britain s membership of the eu ,Brexit,0.177151904
6232,"Confused by the latest developments in the UK’s fraught departure from the European Union? Here’s your no-frills primer to what’s going on in Brexit – and what might happen next.Two-and-a-half years and a fraught series of negotiations after the UK voted to leave the EU, the two parties finally managed to sign their two-part divorce deal late last year.The first part of this is the 585-page withdrawal agreement covering the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals on the continent, the sum Britain must pay the bloc for past commitments, and a mechanism (the “backstop”) to avoid customs and other border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The second part is a much shorter political declaration on the shape they would like their future trading relations to take, which is vaguely worded enough to allow for almost any outcome, from a close Norway-style relationship to a more distant free trade arrangement like the EU has signed with Canada.In theory, this whole package must now be approved by the British parliament so the necessary legislation can be passed to allow the UK to formally leave the EU as planned at the end of the two-year article 50 exit process on 29 March.Britain would then enter a 20-month transition period, during which nothing much will change and the future relationship will be negotiated, before finally stepping out into the big, wide world in December 2020 (or a bit later, depending on how long it takes to do the trade deal).Essentially because the withdrawal agreement – and particularly the backstop, which will come into force if the detailed terms of the future trading relationship do not manage to avoid that hard Irish border – does not have a majority in parliament.MPs in favour of Brexit fear it could leave Britain a perpetual Brussels “rule-taker”, potentially trapped in the EU’s regulatory orbit forever. Those opposed to Brexit say the deal risks leaving the country economically weakened, with no say in EU rule-making, and worse off all round than staying in the EU.The opposition Labour party rejects the deal, as do a large number of Conservative hardline Brexiters. The Democratic Unionist party, on which the government relies for its majority, also object, leaving the government facing a crushing defeat in the House of Commons.That is why Theresa May, the prime minister, pulled the Commons vote on the agreement that was planned pre-Christmas, rescheduling it for 15 January in the hope she could persuade the EU to come up with concessions or guarantees that would win her opponents (or enough of them) over.Good question. The EU hasn’t budged (it can’t, to any great extent: the agreement is legally binding, approved by 27 countries, and will not be reopened), and it is hard to see what supplementary assurances it could offer that would satisfy the Brexiters.Parliamentary resistance has not weakened, and the government has been reduced to trying to cut side-deals – in the form of amendments to the deal – with various different interest groups to try and peel off some of the objectors. Few observers think this tactic will work.In the meantime, the prime minister’s opponents in the Commons are waging a procedural guerilla war, tabling – and winning – amendments aimed at wresting more and more power over the process from the government and giving it to MPs instead, particularly if a no-deal Brexit looks likely.The problem is that while there is no clear majority for May’s deal, there is no clear majority for anything else either: not for a second referendum, nor a fresh election (Labour’s objective), or no deal (which almost all economist and business groups say would be a catastrophe), or a mooted “Norway-plus”, single-market style deal. And the clock is ticking.Assuming May is defeated on 15 January, many think it increasingly likely that the government may have to ask the EU27 for an extension to the two-year article 50 deadline to allow it – or more accurately, given the current mood, parliament – to look again at the existing deal, or try to develop an alternative Brexit approach it can agree on.Brexit, in other words, is far from over yet.",What is going on in Brexit – and what might happen next?,2019-01-11/01:00:16+0000,confused by the latest developments in the uk s fraught departure from the european union here s your no frills primer to what s going on in brexit and what might happen next two and a half years and a fraught series of negotiations after the uk voted to leave the eu the two parties finally managed to sign their two part divorce deal late last year the first part of this is the  page withdrawal agreement covering the rights of eu citizens in the uk and british nationals on the continent the sum britain must pay the bloc for past commitments and a mechanism the backstop to avoid customs and other border controls between northern ireland and the republic the second part is a much shorter political declaration on the shape they would like their future trading relations to take which is vaguely worded enough to allow for almost any outcome from a close norway style relationship to a more distant free trade arrangement like the eu has signed with canada in theory this whole package must now be approved by the british parliament so the necessary legislation can be passed to allow the uk to formally leave the eu as planned at the end of the two year article  exit process on  march britain would then enter a  month transition period during which nothing much will change and the future relationship will be negotiated before finally stepping out into the big wide world in december  or a bit later depending on how long it takes to do the trade deal essentially because the withdrawal agreement and particularly the backstop which will come into force if the detailed terms of the future trading relationship do not manage to avoid that hard irish border does not have a majority in parliament mps in favour of brexit fear it could leave britain a perpetual brussels rule taker potentially trapped in the eu s regulatory orbit forever those opposed to brexit say the deal risks leaving the country economically weakened with no say in eu rule making and worse off all round than staying in the eu the opposition labour party rejects the deal as do a large number of conservative hardline brexiters the democratic unionist party on which the government relies for its majority also object leaving the government facing a crushing defeat in the house of commons that is why theresa may the prime minister pulled the commons vote on the agreement that was planned pre christmas rescheduling it for  january in the hope she could persuade the eu to come up with concessions or guarantees that would win her opponents or enough of them over good question the eu hasn t budged it can t to any great extent the agreement is legally binding approved by  countries and will not be reopened and it is hard to see what supplementary assurances it could offer that would satisfy the brexiters parliamentary resistance has not weakened and the government has been reduced to trying to cut side deals in the form of amendments to the deal with various different interest groups to try and peel off some of the objectors few observers think this tactic will work in the meantime the prime minister s opponents in the commons are waging a procedural guerilla war tabling and winning amendments aimed at wresting more and more power over the process from the government and giving it to mps instead particularly if a no deal brexit looks likely the problem is that while there is no clear majority for may s deal there is no clear majority for anything else either not for a second referendum nor a fresh election labour s objective or no deal which almost all economist and business groups say would be a catastrophe or a mooted norway plus single market style deal and the clock is ticking assuming may is defeated on  january many think it increasingly likely that the government may have to ask the eu for an extension to the two year article  deadline to allow it or more accurately given the current mood parliament to look again at the existing deal or try to develop an alternative brexit approach it can agree on brexit in other words is far from over yet ,Brexit,0.332678199
6328,"Japan’s prime minister, Shinzō Abe, who is to meet Theresa May in London on Thursday, will underscore the damage Brexit is likely to have on Japanese investment in Britain by first visiting the Netherlands, the country to which many UK-based Japanese firms are redeploying ahead of the UK’s departure from the EU.The choice of the Netherlands as the other stop on Abe’s mini-European tour is not a coincidence since he will also be given a chance to be briefed on how a no-deal Brexit could clog the flow of trade into Rotterdam, the main gateway for Japanese and British firms into the EU single market.Abe is also likely at a Downing Street press conference to urge acceptance of Theresa May’s Brexit deal, but he will be watched to see how closely he echoes the words of the UK business secretary, Greg Clark, that a no-deal Brexit cannot be contemplated.British officials insist the visit to London is not a panicked effort to dragoon influential overseas support for her deal, but instead forms part of a pattern of visits designed to strengthen relations with Japan across the fields of business, security and research.But some Japanese firms have lost patience with the UK’s inability to provide Brexit certainty and are setting up parallel offices, primarily in the Netherlands, to ensure they have a bolthole in the event of a no-deal Brexit, or a deal that severely restricts UK-based firms’ access to the EU single market.Companies that have transferred headquarters to Holland include Panasonic, and the banks Nomura and Daiwa.The UK absorbs 40% of Japanese investment destined for the EU.Jeroen CM Nijland, the commissioner of the Netherlands foreign investment agency, said the body was handling about 250 Brexit-related projects. Over the course of 2017, its caseload more than tripled and it has had to hire six additional staff. There are an estimated 1,000 Japanese firms operating in the UK employing 150,000 people.The Japanese ambassador to London, Koji Tsuruoka, has already said “no private company can continue operations” in the UK if it becomes unprofitable.Abe will hear directly from Japanese businesses based in the UK at a Downing Street reception. Firms such as Nissan have already demanded certainty, and said the reintroduction of UK-EU trading on World Trade Organization terms would mean tariffs on cars set at 10 %, wiping out fragile car industry profit margins.In meetings in The Hague with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, Abe will also be briefed on the preparations the Dutch government has been making to keep UK-European trade flowing.The Dutch have also started hiring about 950 customs officers, mostly at Rotterdam port, Europe’s largest, to prepare for the extra bureaucracy required for British goods to enter the EU if the two sides do not reach a withdrawal agreement.Abe will hardly be reassured by UK government-commissioned studies showing lorries could be waiting as long as six days to cross the channel.Big queues at British ports would also destroy the “just in time” production methods at the heart of the car industry.British officials are keen to emphasise the continuity in the UK relationship, including co-operation in the fields of artificial intelligence and ageing societies. British security co-operation with Japan over North Korea and the South China seas has also stepped up.May will also confirm UK willingness to join the Japan-led regional free trade association, a successor to the Transatlantic Trade Partnership.Japan is due to launch its free trade deal with the EU next month from which the UK will eventually be excluded.",May hopes Japanese PM will back Brexit stance in London visit,2019-01-08/15:52:27+0000,japan s prime minister shinzō abe who is to meet theresa may in london on thursday will underscore the damage brexit is likely to have on japanese investment in britain by first visiting the netherlands the country to which many uk based japanese firms are redeploying ahead of the uk s departure from the eu the choice of the netherlands as the other stop on abe s mini european tour is not a coincidence since he will also be given a chance to be briefed on how a no deal brexit could clog the flow of trade into rotterdam the main gateway for japanese and british firms into the eu single market abe is also likely at a downing street press conference to urge acceptance of theresa may s brexit deal but he will be watched to see how closely he echoes the words of the uk business secretary greg clark that a no deal brexit cannot be contemplated british officials insist the visit to london is not a panicked effort to dragoon influential overseas support for her deal but instead forms part of a pattern of visits designed to strengthen relations with japan across the fields of business security and research but some japanese firms have lost patience with the uk s inability to provide brexit certainty and are setting up parallel offices primarily in the netherlands to ensure they have a bolthole in the event of a no deal brexit or a deal that severely restricts uk based firms access to the eu single market companies that have transferred headquarters to holland include panasonic and the banks nomura and daiwa the uk absorbs  of japanese investment destined for the eu jeroen cm nijland the commissioner of the netherlands foreign investment agency said the body was handling about  brexit related projects over the course of  its caseload more than tripled and it has had to hire six additional staff there are an estimated   japanese firms operating in the uk employing   people the japanese ambassador to london koji tsuruoka has already said no private company can continue operations in the uk if it becomes unprofitable abe will hear directly from japanese businesses based in the uk at a downing street reception firms such as nissan have already demanded certainty and said the reintroduction of uk eu trading on world trade organization terms would mean tariffs on cars set at  wiping out fragile car industry profit margins in meetings in the hague with the dutch prime minister mark rutte abe will also be briefed on the preparations the dutch government has been making to keep uk european trade flowing the dutch have also started hiring about  customs officers mostly at rotterdam port europe s largest to prepare for the extra bureaucracy required for british goods to enter the eu if the two sides do not reach a withdrawal agreement abe will hardly be reassured by uk government commissioned studies showing lorries could be waiting as long as six days to cross the channel big queues at british ports would also destroy the just in time production methods at the heart of the car industry british officials are keen to emphasise the continuity in the uk relationship including co operation in the fields of artificial intelligence and ageing societies british security co operation with japan over north korea and the south china seas has also stepped up may will also confirm uk willingness to join the japan led regional free trade association a successor to the transatlantic trade partnership japan is due to launch its free trade deal with the eu next month from which the uk will eventually be excluded ,Brexit,0.192001194

In less than three months, the UK is due to leave the EU. Not that you’d know it. The withdrawal deal struck between Theresa May and the EU27 is no closer to winning MPs’ approval than it was before Christmas.After the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told the UK to “get its act together”, the prime minister urged the Commons in her new year address to allow the the country to “turn a corner” by voting through the unpopular deal.But she failed to win any concessions from EU leaders over the Christmas period and, having insisted MPs will vote on the agreement in the week starting 14 January (the UK will be “in uncharted territory” if they reject it, she warned), has now launched a fresh round of appeals to the bloc to cut her some slack on the Irish backstop.“Friendly” conversations with, among others, Juncker have so far got her nowhere, with the EU adamant that negotiations on the withdrawal agreement “have been concluded” and the bloc has gone as far as it can in offering reassurances over the backstop.Germany and Ireland are doing what they can, but any potential fix they come up with will be limited to tweaks to the political declaration. The EU could perhaps offer an “exchange of letters” confirming its intention to conclude trade talks by 2021, so avoiding the need for the backstop, but whether that will satisfy Tory Brexiters or the DUP, which has ruled out backing the deal, is far from clear.Labour, meanwhile, will support a backbench amendment that could severely restrict the government’s taxation powers unless no deal is taken off the table, and could offer a second referendum on an EU deal it renegotiates, as the party leadership came under intense pressure over its Brexit policy.One poll showed Labour support would collapse at the next election if it eventually backed a Brexit deal, while another survey of party members suggested most believed Jeremy Corbyn should back a second Brexit vote – 90% would opt to remain. So far, however, the Labour leader has remained defiant.Meanwhile, Brexit-related economic gloom deepened. Economists predicted GDP growth of just 0.1% for the final quarter of 2018, manufacturers face their biggest worker shortage in 30 years and house prices took a major hit.Police reinforcements are to be deployed to Northern Ireland to deal with the disorder of a possible no-deal Brexit, which universities said would be catastrophic, and the government has signed a £14m contract with a ferry firm that has no ferries and copied its T&Cs from a fast food delivery joint.As the prime minister announced she would chair a new cabinet committee on Brexit planning, including for no deal, the one thing we can be sure of is that it’s going to be a fun-packed few weeks.Parliament will finally have its delayed vote on the withdrawal agreement on 15 January, government sources have confirmed. Before then, May aims to offer reassurances in three areas: Northern Ireland, the role of parliament in future negotiations and (in written and legal form) the role of EU27 member states.The DUP and hardliner Tory Brexiters will not be convinced, and the EU is unlikely to make any further concessions until MPs have defeated the agreement at least once, as seems almost certain, so as to prevent Brexiters from coming back for yet more.If the margin of the defeat is less than about 100, the government may make a final appeal to the EU27 for help in the unlikely hope it can come back to parliament with a substantively different proposition.Pressure on May will increase. Labour could table a vote of no confidence, and hard-Brexiters in her cabinet could revolt. Ultimately, she hopes to convince the DUP, Tory hardliners and enough Labour leavers in a second parliamentary vote that the choice is her Brexit, no deal, or no Brexit at all.A very heavy defeat on 15 January, or a second defeat, could trigger a crisis. Anything could happen: a mass cabinet walkout; indicative votes; a change of strategy, perhaps towards a permanent customs union; a second referendum, or an election (though the two latter options would mean extending article 50, requiring EU27 agreement).No-deal Brexit lorry rehearsal in Kent “a waste of time”.May will win vote on her deal on 15 January, says Brexit minister.Most Tory members would choose no deal over May’s plan.Chris Patten says UK must have second EU referendum.John Redwood says UK is losing sight of Brexit benefits.No-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for UK farmers, warns the NFU.UK nationals in Italy assured of residency in event of no-deal Brexit.Publicity drive to prepare UK public for possible no-deal Brexit.Sadiq Khan angers Brexiters with pro-EU fireworks display.Record number of Britons seek Irish passports before Brexit.In the Guardian, Anne Perkins says of Channel 4’s Brexit drama The Uncivil War, which focuses on the role of Dominic Cummings, that Brexit was “fuelled by deceit, not one oddball”:The shameless misinformation that Cummings and his associates propagated was infinitely more brazen and dangerous than anything that has gone before … Their audacity was best summed up in the single, Cummings-crafted message, “Take back control”, implying that control – sovereignty – had been frivolously, cravenly surrendered by an effete political class for no discernible reward. The notorious pledge of £350m a week to the NHS was the symbol of what restored sovereignty would deliver. It was a grossly misleading figure that crowned a campaign based on deceit.

There is none. There is only May’s deal. The Brexiters’ argument that Britain held all the cards was rubbish. Next week’s vote still looks hopeless, but that is because so many MPs will defy their whips. This is a classic case where parliament should rise above party.

over the backstop germany and ireland are doing what they can but any potential fix they come up with will be limited to tweaks to the political declaration the eu could perhaps offer an exchange of

6398,"Labour could offer to hold a referendum on an EU deal that it had renegotiated as part of an early general election manifesto, a shadow cabinet minister has suggested.Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said Labour could campaign on a promise to negotiate a better Brexit deal than that secured by Theresa May, and said he personally believed that any such deal could then be put to the public.Labour’s official policy is to push for a general election if the prime minister fails to get her Brexit deal through parliament, but that all other options remain on the table.Jeremy Corbyn is facing demands from MPs – including several shadow cabinet members – to throw his weight behind a referendum if Labour cannot force an early election.Pressure has intensified after a major opinion poll commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign indicated Labour could suffer a backlash from voters if it failed to oppose Brexit in parliament. The YouGov poll of more than 25,000 people indicated a second referendum is backed by 75% of Labour voters.Gardiner, interviewed on Sky News, said the quickest way of getting a people’s vote was to have a general election, because legislating for a referendum would take far longer.At an election, Labour “would set out what we would seek to negotiate in Europe to try and deliver,”, he told presenter Sophy Ridge.Gardiner said May had botched her EU negotiations because of her red lines. “If we as a new, incoming Labour government were to go to Europe without those red lines we know that we could get a different, better deal.“At that stage it makes sense to go to the country and say, ‘here we are, this is what we have managed to negotiate, this is the deal that we have managed to conclude because we don’t have the same red lines as Theresa May.’“And it seems to me, at a personal level, what I would then say is that is the time when we would then say to people, ‘now make your decision on what we have managed to conclude,’” he said.Gardiner’s comments come after the YouGov poll found Labour trail the Tories at 34% to 40% as it stands, with Labour’s support falling to 26% if Labour MPs voted with the Tories to bring about Brexit.A Labour source said the party had made clear its priority was a good deal or a general election but without these, “all options” remained on the table, including a campaign for a public vote.In further signs of tensions over the People’s Vote campaign, Emily Thornberry accused it of seeking to “slap the Labour party around”.The shadow foreign secretary told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Pienaar’s Politics: “What I would like them to be particularly focusing on is taking the arguments as to why we should remain in the European Union to people who voted to leave and to try to change some hearts and minds, rather than using it – as some people I think do – as an opportunity to attack the Labour party and the leadership of the Labour party.”A People’s Vote spokesman said Thornberry was “badly mistaken” in her views about the campaign, adding: “What we are doing is highlighting the biggest poll on Brexit yet, which shows that Labour will suffer its worst electoral defeat since the 1930s if it continues promising to enable some sort of Brexit to go ahead.“In that situation, it won’t be us slapping the leadership but millions of Labour voters who want the party to fight for the public services, rights and living standards that will otherwise be hammered by any kind of Brexit deal.”","Labour could offer second EU referendum, says

6517,"Boris Johnson will still need a bloc of Labour MPs to vote for any Brexit agreement struck with the EU, even if his whips have managed to reduce the number of Tory Eurosceptic “Spartans” holding out against a deal down to just eight.The prime minister insisted again on Monday that he wants a deal with Brussels that removes the Northern Ireland backstop. But even if he secures some concessions that he can sell as a new deal, his chances of getting that agreement through the House of Commons remain extremely finely balanced.On the current numbers, he has 287 MPs who voted for a deal last time, while there are 289 MPs from opposition parties and independents who are against a deal.Johnson would need to reach a total of 319 MPs to win a vote, discounting Sinn Féin MPs, the speaker and his deputies, who all do not vote, and three Labour MPs who abstained last time round.Analysis by the Guardian shows there are about 60 MPs who potentially could go either way. These include 28 Spartans who refused to vote for Theresa May’s deal but could potentially be persuaded to back a Johnson-led agreement, plus 10 DUP MPs who Johnson is trying to sign up to his new plan for a watered-down version of a Northern Ireland-only backstop.Tory sources have told the Sun that the Conservative whips believe that the 28 rebels can be squeezed down to about eight of the hardest Eurosceptics. But even in the best case scenario for the prime minister of an extra 20 Tories and 10 DUP MPs on board, Johnson would still need some Labour votes to very narrowly squeeze a deal through the Commons.There are 26 Labour MPs who have signed a letter publicly urging Jeremy Corbyn to try to strike a Brexit deal before 31 October, of whom five have already previously voted for a deal and one abstained. Of the remaining bloc of 21, many of them would want to see at the very least concessions offered by May during talks with Labour enshrined in the agreement before voting for it, but several have indicated to the Guardian they are getting to the point where they are likely to vote for almost any agreement to end the impasse and avoid a second referendum or no-deal situation.The closeness of the numbers would be likely to put huge pressure on individual MPs and lead to some big personal decisions. Jo Johnson, the prime minister’s brother who resigned from his top team over Brexit, previously voted against May’s deal because of his support for a second referendum, but could potentially switch sides this time.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.Daniel BoffeySir Norman Lamb, a Liberal Democrat MP, is also now on the record expressing support for some sort of deal, which goes against his party’s new policy of being in favour of revoking article 50.A source close to one pro-deal cabinet minister said Johnson had not yet started wooing Labour MPs but that would come at the last minute if it appears more likely that an agreement palatable to the DUP is taking shape.The source said most of the Spartan Tories have, politically, “nowhere else to go” now that the prime minister is mandated by law to request an extension on 31 October if no deal is passed.A cross-party group of MPs last week formally launched a campaign to win support in the Commons for Brexit via a managed deal, arguing both a no-deal departure or a second referendum would cement political divisions and cause endless uncertainty.The organisers – including the Labour MPs Caroline Flint and Stephen Kinnock as well as Lamb and the former Tory Rory Stewart – claim up to 50 MPs so far may back the plan, which would involve using elements of May’s Brexit proposals as the basis for an agreement which Boris Johnson could steer through parliament, possibly in time for a 31 October departure.",Johnson dependent on Labour MP votes for any Brexit deal,2019-09-16/19:55:38,boris johnson

6707,"Boris Johnson has been publicly offered a non-aggression pact by Nigel Farage if he signs up fully to a no-deal departure from the EU and the Conservatives stand aside in more than 80 seats, amid signs the prime minister could be considering softer options for a deal with Brussels.The Brexit party leader urged the prime minister to strike an agreement to stand jointly in favour of no deal, at a time of increasing speculation that Johnson is revisiting ways of making a version of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement work.Johnson insists he is not proposing a Northern Ireland-only backstop, which EU leaders hope he could move towards, as that would not be acceptable to the Democratic Unionist party. However, the idea of an all-Ireland agrifood zone of regulatory alignment as part of the solution was discussed on Tuesday by Johnson and Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, as long as it did not extend to an all-Ireland customs area with a tariff border in the Irish Sea.The idea would not be enough to satisfy Brussels that the backstop is no longer necessary, but the discussions were taken as a sign that Johnson is more focused than ever on finding solutions to the Irish border problem.A No 10 spokesman said Johnson rejected the idea of an alliance with Farage, saying he “has been clear – no pact”.It comes as the Sun reported that Johnson recently claimed to anti-no-deal Tory rebels that ultimately the hardline Eurosceptic Conservatives would be the ones putting “spears in my back” when they realise he is prepared to make a compromise on a deal.The prime minister also told cabinet he was fundamentally liberal and should be regarded as a “Brexity Hezza”– a reference to the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine.Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, did not deny Johnson was looking at softer options for a deal on Wednesday morning, as she appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We are looking at creative ways to ensure no Irish backstop,” she said. “We are looking at getting a good deal that works for the UK that is different to existing one.”However, Farage is preparing to exploit any move by Johnson towards a return to May’s withdrawal deal, which the prime minister had promised his supporters was dead and that the backstop must be completely removed.The Brexit party took out a full-page advert in the Sun and a wraparound ad in the Daily Express, setting out its terms for a hard Brexit alliance to take on tactical voting among supporters of the pro-referendum parties.Farage would pledge to give the Tories a clear run at all their existing seats and targets if the Brexit party were to get a similar deal in 80-90 constituencies. Johnson would also have to sign up unequivocally to a no-deal departure.He challenged Johnson: “If you have the courage for a clean-break Brexit, then we will help you secure a big Brexit majority.

6740,"A close ally of the Irish prime minister is poised to get a key role in post-Brexit negotiations in Brussels as the new commissioner for trade.Phil Hogan, the agriculture commissioner, is expected to be formally appointed to the role of EU trade commissioner on Tuesday by the incoming commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and will take up his role on 1 November.In his new job Hogan will represent the EU at the World Trade Organization and oversee talks in a move that could sound alarm bells for Brexiters hoping for a swift trade deal.But his appointment could also be a blessing for Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, who told Boris Johnson that Ireland would be the UK’s closest friend and ally in trade negotiations.Hogan, 59, is from the same party as Varadkar, Fine Gael, and was appointed after being nominated by the taoiseach’s predecessor, Enda Kenny.Announcing Hogan’s appointment, Von der Leyen said: “He will be a very fair, but determined negotiator.”Von der Leyen also reiterated that the manner of Britain’s EU departure would shape its future relationship with the bloc. “Brexit, should it happen, is not the end of something, but it is the beginning of our future relationship.”Von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, has previously told the Guardian that she was “open to listening” to a request for extension “if there are good reasons”.Known in Ireland as “Big Phil”, Hogan is a fixer, bruiser and wily operator. The Irish Times recently described him as “a sometimes abrasive political figure at home” but “also a deft political strategist” who had recently come under attack from farmers in Ireland over a proposed beef deal with countries in the South American Mercosur bloc.He has been highly critical of the British approach to Brexit and recently he launched a scathing attack on Johnson, describing him as an unelected prime minister who was “gambling” with Ireland’s peace process.He also warned that a hard Brexit would create a “foul atmosphere” with the EU and would have “serious consequences” for the UK’s chances of a favourable trade deal with the bloc.However, others in Ireland see his appointment to the trade portfolio as a positive step for Johnson because the taoiseach and his deputy have repeatedly promised over the past three years that they would be the UK’s strongest ally in trade talks, because no country wants a better outcome than its westerly neighbour.On Monday, Varadkar warned Johnson that trade talks with the EU would be a “herculean” challenge but said Ireland would act as his friend in Brussels. “We want to be your friend and ally, your Athena,” he said in reference to the Greek goddess who prevented Hercules from murdering his foster parent.Von der Leyen’s commission will be the first not to include a British member since 1973. The remaining 27 EU member states have nominated a politician to send to Brussels. Only the UK did not propose a candidate, in line with Johnson’s determination to leave on 31 October “do or die”.But Von der Leyen said the UK would have to appoint a commissioner if it was still in the EU after 1 November.European commissioners swear an oath not to take instructions from any government and act in the general interest of the bloc. The UK’s current commissioner, the career diplomat Sir Julian King, was given a job to promote the EU’s “security union”, after Lord Hill quit his post on financial services days after the 2016 referendum result.",Irish PM's ally to get key post-Brexit role as EU trade commissioner,2019-09-10/16:09:20,a close ally of the irish prime minister is poised to get a key role in post brexit negotiations in brussels as the new commissioner for trade phil hogan the agriculture commissioner is expected to be formally appointed to the role of eu trade commissioner on tuesday by the incoming commission president ursula von der leyen and will take up his role on  november in his new job hogan will represent the eu at the world trade organization and oversee talks in a move that could sound alarm bells for brexiters hoping for a swift trade deal but his appointment could also be a blessing for leo varadkar the taoiseach who told boris johnson that ireland would be the uk s closest friend and ally in trade negotiations hogan  is from the same party as varadkar fine gael and was appointed after being nominated by the taoiseach s predecessor enda kenny announcing hogan s appointment von der leyen said he will be a very fair but determined negotiator von der leyen also reiterated that the manner of britain s eu departure would shape its future relationship with the bloc brexit should it happen is not the end of something but it is the beginning of our future relationship von der leyen a former german defence minister has previously told the guardian that she was open to listening to a request for extension if there are good reasons known in ireland as big phil hogan is a fixer bruiser and wily operator the irish times recently described him as a sometimes abrasive political figure at home but also a deft political strategist who had recently come under attack from farmers in ireland over a proposed beef deal with countries in the south american mercosur bloc he has been highly critical of the british approach to brexit and recently he launched a scathing attack on johnson describing him as an unelected prime minister who was gambling with ireland s peace process he also warned that a hard brexit would create a foul atmosphere with the eu and would have serious consequences for the uk s chances of a favourable trade deal with the bloc however others in ireland see his appointment to the trade portfolio as a positive step for johnson because the taoiseach and his deputy have repeatedly promised over the past three years that they would be the uk s strongest ally in trade talks because no country wants a better outcome than its westerly neighbour on monday varadkar warned johnson that trade talks with the eu would be a herculean challenge but said ireland would act as his friend in brussels we want to be your friend and ally your athena he said in reference to the greek goddess who prevented hercules from murdering his foster parent von der leyen s commission will be the first not to include a british member since  the remaining  eu member states have nominated a politician to send to brussels only the uk did not propose a candidate in line with johnson s determination to leave on  october do or die but von der leyen said the uk would have to appoint a commissioner if it was still in the eu after  november european commissioners swear an oath not to take instructions from any government and act in the general interest of the bloc the uk s current commissioner the career diplomat sir julian king was given a job to promote the eu s security union after lord hill quit his post on financial services days after the  referendum result ,Brexit,0.223819643
6754,"After three years of debate and negotiation there is little new under the sun when it comes to Brexit. But it is rumoured in Westminster, and hoped in Brussels, that Boris Johnson is to revert to a Northern Ireland-only backstop as he seeks to move past the Brexit impasse and avoid breaking his word and extending the UK’s membership beyond 31 October.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between the end of the stand-still transition period that is offered in the withdrawal agreement and the start of an all-solving future economic relationship.The backstop in the current withdrawal agreement would temporarily keep Northern Ireland in the single market, meaning some checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain. But the whole of the UK would stay in a shared customs territory with the EU. This insurance arrangement was negotiated by Theresa May because the then prime minister was of the opinion that no British prime minister could countenance agreeing to the EU’s first proposal: a backstop that involved only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would involve a customs border being drawn in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK.Boris Johnson has been thwarted from holding a general election or taking the country out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. But the prime minister has also said  he would rather “die in a ditch” than ask the EU for an extension to the UK’s membership. Logic would suggest his only option now would be to agree a tweaked deal with the EU and bring it back to parliament in October. He has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agrifood zone, which is one part of a Northern Ireland-only backstop. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Johnson’s EU envoy, David Frost, has already sought to discuss governance with the EU of any NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable.It is difficult to see where Johnson finds a majority in parliament. Labour, the Democratic Unionists and a large number of Conservative backbenchers have opposed the NI-only backstop in the past. An NI-only arrangement does, however, allow the UK to pursue its own trade policy, unlike the backstop in the withdrawal agreement. It could be the landing zone after a general election for a newly returned Johnson administration if the parliamentary arithmetic has changed.",A Northern Ireland-only backstop: what is it and will anyone go for it?,2019-09-10/11:39:36,after three years of debate and negotiation there is little new under the sun when it comes to brexit but it is rumoured in westminster and hoped in brussels that boris johnson is to revert to a northern ireland only backstop as he seeks to move past the brexit impasse and avoid breaking his word and extending the uk s membership beyond  october the british government s version of brexit involves the uk leaving the single market and customs union requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland the backstop is intended as a placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between the end of the stand still transition period that is offered in the withdrawal agreement and the start of an all solving future economic relationship the backstop in the current withdrawal agreement would temporarily keep northern ireland in the single market meaning some checks on goods entering northern ireland from britain but the whole of the uk would stay in a shared customs territory with the eu this insurance arrangement was negotiated by theresa may because the then prime minister was of the opinion that no british prime minister could countenance agreeing to the eu s first proposal a backstop that involved only northern ireland staying in the eu s customs territory that would involve a customs border being drawn in the irish sea may described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the uk boris johnson has been thwarted from holding a general election or taking the country out of the eu without a deal on  october but the prime minister has also said he would rather die in a ditch than ask the eu for an extension to the uk s membership logic would suggest his only option now would be to agree a tweaked deal with the eu and bring it back to parliament in october he has opened the current talks by proposing an all ireland agrifood zone which is one part of a northern ireland only backstop the suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further ni only arrangements johnson s eu envoy david frost has already sought to discuss governance with the eu of any ni only arrangements given an ni only backstop was an eu proposal in the first place the u turn would be warmly welcomed although attempts to give the northern ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable it is difficult to see where johnson finds a majority in parliament labour the democratic unionists and a large number of conservative backbenchers have opposed the ni only backstop in the past an ni only arrangement does however allow the uk to pursue its own trade policy unlike the backstop in the withdrawal agreement it could be the landing zone after a general election for a newly returned johnson administration if the parliamentary arithmetic has changed ,Brexit,0.408631384
6795,"The attention of Brexit-watchers has understandably been focused on Boris Johnson’s disastrous week in parliament and the exact timing of any election. But key to what happens next is, of course, the EU’s position.When UK (and European) commentators talk about the EU’s stance on Brexit, they almost invariably conclude that “nothing has changed”. Europe’s unity is paramount. Ireland will not be sacrificed. The withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. Even suggesting that Germany’s deteriorating economic conditions may give Berlin some pause for thought is tantamount to heresy. The EU’s Brexit position is fixed in time and space. The truth, as always, is more nuanced, as I learned during meetings in Brussels at the end of last week. There is real debate in the EU about Brexit. The EU’s position today is subtly different to that of two weeks ago. And its position of two weeks ago subtly different to that which came before. So where is the EU currently on Brexit?The EU liked Olly Robbins, Theresa May’s Brexit negotiator. Intelligent, thoughtful, persistent and tirelessly hardworking, he was widely respected among his EU peers as someone they could do business with. They were less keen on May herself. Their misgivings were well-founded. Robbins negotiated a Brexit deal widely recognised in Europe as an excellent outcome for the UK, in light of the red lines his prime minister had drawn at the time. Yet May proved incapable of managing the domestic politics and selling his deal. This provides the context for understanding how the EU sees Johnson.While there is a lot in him they dislike, they welcomed the fact he is a “red-blooded politician”, as one adviser to an EU head of state put it to me. A breath of fresh air compared to May. The fact Brexit is inherently political for Johnson – a means to a bigger Commons majority – creates the glimmer, no matter how slight, that he may be able to get a deal over the line. This, combined with Johnson’s singular focus on the backstop, and his willingness to adopt “a continental line” on global issues at the G7 in Biarritz, gave EU leaders more confidence a deal could possibly be struck.This was partly why the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, signalled a willingness to explore changes to the backstop, insofar as any new UK proposals protect the Irish peace process and the EU’s single market.This view still holds – just – despite the events of the last few weeks. But it’s equally fair to say that the goodwill Johnson did establish is quickly ebbing. But this is not for the reasons people might think.It is true that the government has not tabled any formal proposals to the EU yet. This reinforces scepticism in Westminster that the government is serious about a deal. However, senior EU officials and negotiators were not expecting much prior to the Tory party conference, which runs from 29 September to 2 October. The critical window they have earmarked were the weeks running into the 17-18 October European heads of state meeting in Brussels, and after, until 31 October.Moreover, trial balloons floated by No 10 have made their way to the EU’s institutions and have been discussed by the 27 member states. These include radically reducing the backstop to sectoral elements and proposing a single all-Ireland regime for agriculture.David Frost, Johnson’s most senior official for European affairs and the government’s lead negotiator, has also clarified the government’s approach to Brexit, clearly setting out new parameters for the negotiation. Unlike Robbins and May, the Johnson government is not seeking “frictionless trade” with the EU while simultaneously leaving the EU’s two economic institutions that are necessary to deliver it – the customs union and the single market. Instead, Johnson and Frost only want to “facilitate” trade with the EU. They accept that Brexit will mean the UK’s access to EU markets will suffer.This is where Europe’s concerns set in. The ideas floated by No 10 suggest a trade border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. As one senior EU negotiator puts it: “The backstop means no border on the island of Ireland. But the UK’s solution will result in a customs and regulatory border – which will carry implications for peace.” This is obviously unacceptable for the EU27.The government also wants to bank the benefits of Brexit by diverging from EU rules to the maximum extent possible. Yet this has fostered the perception in EU capitals that the UK will compete with its firms by undercutting EU standards.Politically, it makes little strategic sense for the EU to compromise on the backstop – and risk its principles – if the purpose of doing so is to facilitate a deal over a bare-bones free trade agreement (FTA) that would not differ much from a no-deal outcome. “What’s the difference between no deal and a hard FTA?” ponders another adviser to an EU head of state. In no deal, the EU would at least have stuck to its principles.Once the EU factors in Johnson’s tumultuous week in parliament – that has left him heading an even weaker minority government and facing the high likelihood of an early election – it’s possible to see why its calculus is shifting it again towards a harder, less flexible position.As the UK slides painfully towards an early election, there is less scope for progress in Brussels. Any formal UK proposals will become political fodder. The EU will have to become more cautious in its response; it will not risk its interventions becoming part of the campaign. As the EU ponders events in London, its window for a deal, while open, is closing.• Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director of Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting

6799,"Boris Johnson’s claims to be conducting a Brexit renegotiation have come under fresh doubt as the UK’s closest EU ally expressed alarm at the “breathtaking” developments in Westminster and the government’s failure to table alternatives to the Irish backstop.The Dutch minister for trade, Sigrid Kaag, described the scenes being played out in London as “unbelievable” and warned of the EU’s waning patience given the impact on European businesses of the continued uncertainty.Johnson committed in early August in discussions with EU leaders to swiftly tabling an alternative solution to the Irish backstop, which would temporarily keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.The lack of such proposals and the attempt by the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, over the weekend to lay the blame for a lack of progress on the European commission has confirmed to many in Brussels that the outgoing work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, was right about the prime minister’s lack of seriousness in sealing a deal.In an interview with the Dutch financial newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad, Kaag warned that given the damage caused to European businesses, rebel MPs seeking to delay Brexit would need to tie it to a general election or second referendum to be sure of securing an extension of UK membership of the EU beyond 31 October.“At a point enough is enough,” Kaag said. “At that stage the certainty of deterioration might be better than continuing without perspective. At a certain point there must be clarity. A good reason is needed for a new delay. What? It is difficult to say categorically.“You have to see the context and see if there is a realistic expectation that this will lead to a follow-up phase. But so far, the British have not presented an alternative to the Brexit agreement that is already in place.”Kaag was speaking as figures from The Hague revealed companies from the United Kingdom had substantially increased their investments in the Netherlands in the last year, to a total of €80bn compared with €14bn in 2016.The UK is now the largest investor in the Netherlands. In contrast, Dutch companies divested €11bn over the last year, compared with an investment of €50bn in 2016.“The business case for Brexit is still not well-founded,” Kaag said. “People cast their votes based on an emotion or assessment without socio-economic grounds. The evidence was ignored. The damage is now clear. I think it’s dramatic.”The minister warned that the EU’s patience over the UK’s prevarication would not last forever given the impact on the bloc’s ability to steer its own way forward.Kaag said: “It is always better if you have your house in order and can say: now we are going to get involved with the Americans or prepare ourselves better for the negative consequences of the trade war between the US and China. Brexit always detracts from that.”","EU is losing patience with Britain, warns Dutch minister",2019-09-09/10:13:53,boris johnson s claims to be conducting a brexit renegotiation have come under fresh doubt as the uk s closest eu ally expressed alarm at the breathtaking developments in westminster and the government s failure to table alternatives to the irish backstop the dutch minister for trade sigrid kaag described the scenes being played out in london as unbelievable and warned of the eu s waning patience given the impact on european businesses of the continued uncertainty johnson committed in early august in discussions with eu leaders to swiftly tabling an alternative solution to the irish backstop which would temporarily keep northern ireland in the single market and the uk in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of ireland the lack of such proposals and the attempt by the brexit secretary stephen barclay over the weekend to lay the blame for a lack of progress on the european commission has confirmed to many in brussels that the outgoing work and pensions secretary amber rudd was right about the prime minister s lack of seriousness in sealing a deal in an interview with the dutch financial newspaper het financieele dagblad kaag warned that given the damage caused to european businesses rebel mps seeking to delay brexit would need to tie it to a general election or second referendum to be sure of securing an extension of uk membership of the eu beyond  october at a point enough is enough kaag said at that stage the certainty of deterioration might be better than continuing without perspective at a certain point there must be clarity a good reason is needed for a new delay what it is difficult to say categorically you have to see the context and see if there is a realistic expectation that this will lead to a follow up phase but so far the british have not presented an alternative to the brexit agreement that is already in place kaag was speaking as figures from the hague revealed companies from the united kingdom had substantially increased their investments in the netherlands in the last year to a total of bn compared with bn in  the uk is now the largest investor in the netherlands in contrast dutch companies divested bn over the last year compared with an investment of bn in  the business case for brexit is still not well founded kaag said people cast their votes based on an emotion or assessment without socio economic grounds the evidence was ignored the damage is now clear i think it s dramatic the minister warned that the eu s patience over the uk s prevarication would not last forever given the impact on the bloc s ability to steer its own way forward kaag said it is always better if you have your house in order and can say now we are going to get involved with the americans or prepare ourselves better for the negative consequences of the trade war between the us and china brexit always detracts from that ,Brexit,0.239449799
6802,"Rebel ex-Conservative MPs have dismissed the idea that Boris Johnson could get around a backbench bill forcing him to seek an extension to Brexit, as they warned that more cabinet ministers could follow Amber Rudd in quitting. Johnson was heading to Dublin on Monday to meet the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, having suffered yet another political blow with the resignation of Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, over the weekend.With the Dublin trip seen as key in persuading other worried ministers that Johnson is serious about trying to negotiate a new Brexit deal, Johnson will face a sceptical reception in Ireland, with the Irish government stressing it has yet to see even the basics of a supposed replacement for the backstop border insurance policy.Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary who was among 21 Tory MPs ejected from the party for backing plans to push through the bill mandating a Brexit delay, said he believed there were other ministers considering their positions.“Yes, I think there are,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Because everybody who was in the cabinet with me and Amber, under Theresa May’s government, was very aware of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. And remember, very, very recently – barely seven weeks ago – the formal policy of the cabinet was to avoid a no-deal Brexit.”Here is the list of the 21 Conservative MPs who voted with the opposition and against the government to seize control of the parliamentary timetable in order to pave the way for a bill to block a no-deal Brexit. They were then thrown out of the party by prime minister Boris Johnson.Guto Bebb, AberconwyRichard Benyon, NewburySteve Brine, WinchesterAlistair Burt, North East BedfordshireGreg Clark, Tunbridge WellsKenneth Clarke, RushcliffeDavid Gauke, South West HertfordshireJustine Greening, PutneyDominic Grieve, BeaconsfieldSam Gyimah, East SurreyPhilip Hammond, Runnymede and WeybridgeStephen Hammond, WimbledonRichard Harrington, WatfordMargot James, StourbridgeSir Oliver Letwin, West DorsetAnne Milton, GuildfordCaroline Nokes, Romsey and Southampton NorthAntoinette Sandbach, EddisburySir Nicholas Soames, Mid SussexRory Stewart, Penrith and The BorderEdward Vaizey, WantageLater on Monday, the rebel bill that led to Stewart and others losing the Tory whip is expected to receive royal assent. It will mandate Johnson to seek a Brexit delay till 31 January if, by the middle of next month, he has not passed a departure deal or got MPs’ consent for no deal.Stewart dismissed reported ideas that Johnson – who has pledged to never seek a delay – could seek to get round the law, for example by adding a second letter to the mandated approach to the EU over an extension spelling out that he does not actually want this.“I remain very, very confident we can stop no deal. Because in the end parliament is sovereign, and we are making a positive case for a moderate, pragmatic solution to the problem,” he said.David Gauke, the former justice secretary and another key rebel, said a separate letter would be pointless given the EU would know it was not the will of parliament. “The European Union are perfectly capable of following our news stories,” he told BBC1’s Breakfast programme.Of a parallel letter, Gauke said: “It carries no weight. Statute will say that the position is that the prime minister is writing to the European Union seeking an extension. Now, of course, the European Union can refuse that extension. I personally think that they wouldn’t want to be blamed for a no-deal Brexit and they will agree to an extension.”While saying he was “very confident” that Johnson would ultimately comply with the new law, he condemned anonymous briefings that No 10 could decide to simply ignore it, calling this “damaging to our reputation”.Also speaking on Monday, the former supreme court justice Lord Sumption said it would not be legal for Johnson to apply for a Brexit extension while simultaneously trying to get the EU to reject it.“No, of course it wouldn’t,” he told Today. “The bill, or act as it’s about to become, says that he’s got to apply for an extension. Not only has he got to send the letter, he’s got to apply for an extension. To send the letter and then try to neutralise it seems to me, plainly, a breach of the act. What you’ve got to realise is the courts are not very fond of loopholes.”When he returns from Dublin later on Monday, Johnson is expected to make a second attempt to trigger a general election on 15 October by asking MPs to support a motion tabled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.But he is almost certain to be rebuffed for a second time, after opposition leaders agreed on Friday to reject a

6932,"A “zombie prime minister” cornered by his “own intransigence” whose failed “kamikaze strategy” had left his country facing a future that had “never looked less certain” – Europe’s media were not kind to Boris Johnson after his fourth successive Commons defeat. Le Monde said the prime minister had now “lost control of his Brexit strategy, the calendar and even of his own camp, which is deep in internal crisis”. The prime minister had warned in August the road would be bumpy, the French paper said, “but did he really expect to be buffeted to this extent, and so soon?”The first of Wednesday night’s parliamentary votes “as good as finished off Johnson’s long-promised ‘do-or-die’ Halloween Brexit,” Le Monde said. His second defeat of the evening, in which MPs refused the prime minister an early election before a no-deal Brexit was no longer possible, was “even more bitter”.Add to that the mounting fury in the Conservative party over his purge of Tory rebels, and Downing St “must surely be having doubts”, the paper concluded. Johnson may still have some options – including calling a vote of no confidence in himself – “but who outside the Westminster bubble still understands the Battle of Brexit?”Here is the list of the 21 Conservative MPs who voted with the opposition and against the government to seize control of the parliamentary timetable in order to pave the way for a bill to block a no-deal Brexit.

If he were to win a 15 October election, all now fear he might repeal or otherwise get round the new law, and trigger a no-deal Brexit.”Another was the Conservatives’ weakened position in parliament, the paper said: “Even if he calls a vote of no confidence in his own government, he still needs a majority – which he no longer has. Ultimately, the only certainty at this hour is that snap elections will happen before the end of 2019.”Italy’s Corriere della Sera said Johnson now resembled “a boxer in the corner – and he risks dragging all Britain to the mat”. The prime minister’s plan to keep no deal on the table to force Europe to accept his demands was “a kamikaze strategy: Brussels will not give up, so Britain continues to run towards the cliff edge”, the paper said.With the no-deal option rejected, Johnson turned to new elections, “but Labour refused to fall for it … And so we are faced with an impasse. He could yet try another coup, a single-line bill calling for elections.

Die Welt argued that the PM’s opponents may not benefit from his current “100% failure rate”. Labour’s calculation “will be that Johnson’s broken promise – ‘We leave on 31 October, do or die’ – will be punished by voters,” the paper predicted.But, it said, Johnson’s opponents “cannot rely on that. His election platform will be a brutal anti-EU campaign with a clear no-deal promise. And faced with a devoted rightwing media, growing voter frustration and an opposition that still does not know which Brexit it wants, his prospects for success are very good.”De Volkskrant said Johnson had become “a zombie prime minister”, blocked by the Commons both from maintaining a no-deal Brexit as an option and from holding elections on 15 October, and facing an increasingly rebellious party.“With no deal off the table for the time being but no elections yet, Johnson is stuck, just like Theresa May before him,” the Dutch paper said. “The Kinnock amendment, which could bring May’s agreement back for a fourth vote, may be small lifebuoy. But it was adopted automatically after the government neglected to provide tellers – an incident that summed up British politics in 2019.”Boris Johnson is een zombie-premier geworden.

7032,"The vice-president of the European parliament has said it is unlikely there will be a new Brexit deal at the next European council summit on 17 October.Mairead McGuinness said the EU would not succumb to threats from the UK and said Boris Johnson’s approach “to take back control in a more boisterous way” than Theresa May was not the way to “yield results”.In an interview with RTÉ Radio’s Sean O’Rourke programme, McGuinness confirmed talks were intensifying in Brussels but she said they should not be mischaracterised as a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement.Under the process, Michel Barnier would need to get a new mandate from 27 EU leaders, and in the present febrile atmosphere there was no prospect of change, she said.“I don’t see why it would [change] because if you look at what that would involve, it would be mean that the democratically elected leaders of Europe would yield to a very unhelpful pressure that the British prime minister is heaping upon them, almost threatening that ‘look, we are going either way and you are going to have to deal with us,’” she told RTÉ.McGuinness said she believed Johnson’s preferred option was no deal. “If you look at some of what has been said, it seems clear to me that Prime Minister Johnson is keen for a no-deal Brexit, believing that when and if the UK leaves on that day, that discussion on the future will start immediately and he will get a free trade agreement of his choosing in a very short period of time.”She said Barnier had made it very clear in an article in the Sunday Telegraph that there would be no transition period or mini-deals if the UK crashed out on 1 November.“It is saying very clearly to the UK: if you crash out, there are consequences and don’t expect us to be lenient in eight out of 10 areas to try to facilitate a decision which will be a very disruptive decision,” she said.Lisa Chambers, the opposition party Brexit spokeswoman in Ireland, called for realism to be injected into the narrative in the UK, arguing that some in Westminster were misleading the public into thinking walking out of the EU would solve all the Irish border problems.“You cannot simply leave the EU without a deal and expect that very quickly afterwards the problems that were, such as the backstop, the border issue and protecting the single market, will evaporate into thin air. They will still need to be solved before any future trading arrangement is done,” she said.","UK's 'boisterous' efforts to get new deal will not work, says senior MEP",2019-09-02/16:50:11,the vice president of the european parliament has said it is unlikely there will be a new brexit deal at the next european council summit on  october mairead mcguinness said the eu would not succumb to threats from the uk and said boris johnson s approach to take back control in a more boisterous way than theresa may was not the way to yield results in an interview with rté radio s sean o rourke programme mcguinness confirmed talks were intensifying in brussels but she said they should not be mischaracterised as a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement under the process michel barnier would need to get a new mandate from  eu leaders and in the present febrile atmosphere there was no prospect of change she said i don t see why it would change because if you look at what that would involve it would be mean that the democratically elected leaders of europe would yield to a very unhelpful pressure that the british prime minister is heaping upon them almost threatening that look we are going either way and you are going to have to deal with us she told rté mcguinness said she believed johnson s preferred option was no deal if you look at some of what has been said it seems clear to me that prime minister johnson is keen for a no deal brexit believing that when and if the uk leaves on that day that discussion on the future will start immediately and he will get a free trade agreement of his choosing in a very short period of time she said barnier had made it very clear in an article in the sunday telegraph that there would be no transition period or mini deals if the uk crashed out on  november it is saying very clearly to the uk if you crash out there are consequences and don t expect us to be lenient in eight out of  areas to try to facilitate a decision which will be a very disruptive decision she said lisa chambers the opposition party brexit spokeswoman in ireland called for realism to be injected into the narrative in the uk arguing that some in westminster were misleading the public into thinking walking out of the eu would solve all the irish border problems you cannot simply leave the eu without a deal and expect that very quickly afterwards the problems that were such as the backstop the border issue and protecting the single market will evaporate into thin air they will still need to be solved before any future trading arrangement is done she said ,Brexit,0.312148213
7326,"Boris Johnson has said the £39bn Brexit divorce bill would not “strictly speaking” be owed to Brussels in full in the event of no deal, insisting: “It’s not a threat. It’s a reality.”Speaking to broadcasters as he prepared to meet the European council president, Donald Tusk, at the G7 summit in Biarritz, Johnson said: “If we come out without an agreement it is certainly true that the £39bn is no longer, strictly speaking, owed.”He told ITV: “There will be very substantial sums available to our country to spend on our priorities. It’s not a threat. It’s a simple fact of reality.”His intervention came after Tusk warned Johnson against going down in history as “Mr No Deal”.During the Conservative leadership campaign, Johnson suggested the entire £39bn would be retained in the hope of using it as leverage to win a better future trading relationship from the EU27, saying: “Money is a great solvent and a great lubricant.”But Downing Street appears to have conceded that legal obligations for past liabilities may mean up to a quarter of it may still have to be paid.The remarks on the divorce bill are likely to infuriate Britain’s EU27 counterparts, who are still awaiting detailed proposals from London about how to maintain a soft border in Ireland after Brexit.However, Johnson claimed the chances of renegotiating Britain’s exit had improved after his trips to Berlin and Paris. “In the last few days there has been a change of mood in the EU,” he said.Asked whether negotiations should resume in Brussels – something he hopes Tusk will approve – Johnson said: “It is sensible now to get going and we will get going.”In a separate interview with the BBC, he said it was “touch and go” whether a deal could be reached in time, however – and he sought to lay the blame at the door of the EU27 if the outcome was ultimately a no-deal Brexit.“It all depends on our EU friends and partners. I think in the last few days there has been a dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals what the shape of the problem is for the UK,” he said.During his media round, Johnson also compared the challenge of Brexit to a rock he had encountered on his morning swim in the sea at the French Atlantic resort.“I swam round that rock this morning. From here you cannot tell there is a gigantic hole in that rock. There is a way through,” he said.“My point to the EU is that there is a way through, but you can’t find the way through if you just sit on the beach.”The prime minister also reiterated that the withdrawal agreement, containing what he has repeatedly referred to as the “undemocratic” backstop, must be scrapped, because it could not pass through parliament.Johnson voted for the deal himself at the third time of asking earlier this year, as did several other prominent Brexiters, including the former Brexit secretary David Davis.The prime minister is widely believed at Westminster to be drawing up plans for an early general election, in order to frustrate efforts to tie his hands on Brexit.",Boris Johnson: no deal would mean UK did not owe Brexit divorce bill,2019-08-25/12:58:52,boris johnson has said the bn brexit divorce bill would not strictly speaking be owed to brussels in full in the event of no deal insisting it s not a threat it s a reality speaking to broadcasters as he prepared to meet the european council president donald tusk at the g summit in biarritz johnson said if we come out without an agreement it is certainly true that the bn is no longer strictly speaking owed he told itv there will be very substantial sums available to our country to spend on our priorities it s not a threat it s a simple fact of reality his intervention came after tusk warned johnson against going down in history as mr no deal during the conservative leadership campaign johnson suggested the entire bn would be retained in the hope of using it as leverage to win a better future trading relationship from the eu saying money is a great solvent and a great lubricant but downing street appears to have conceded that legal obligations for past liabilities may mean up to a quarter of it may still have to be paid the remarks on the divorce bill are likely to infuriate britain s eu counterparts who are still awaiting detailed proposals from london about how to maintain a soft border in ireland after brexit however johnson claimed the chances of renegotiating britain s exit had improved after his trips to berlin and paris in the last few days there has been a change of mood in the eu he said asked whether negotiations should resume in brussels something he hopes tusk will approve johnson said it is sensible now to get going and we will get going in a separate interview with the bbc he said it was touch and go whether a deal could be reached in time however and he sought to lay the blame at the door of the eu if the outcome was ultimately a no deal brexit it all depends on our eu friends and partners i think in the last few days there has been a dawning realisation in brussels and other european capitals what the shape of the problem is for the uk he said during his media round johnson also compared the challenge of brexit to a rock he had encountered on his morning swim in the sea at the french atlantic resort i swam round that rock this morning from here you cannot tell there is a gigantic hole in that rock there is a way through he said my point to the eu is that there is a way through but you can t find the way through if you just sit on the beach the prime minister also reiterated that the withdrawal agreement containing what he has repeatedly referred to as the undemocratic backstop must be scrapped because it could not pass through parliament johnson voted for the deal himself at the third time of asking earlier this year as did several other prominent brexiters including the former brexit secretary david davis the prime minister is widely believed at westminster to be drawing up plans for an early general election in order to frustrate efforts to tie his hands on brexit ,Brexit,0.267178595
7357,"Boris Johnson will sit down for breakfast on Sunday morning with a man he once famously described as “betraying a quite stupefying ignorance that makes him frankly unfit to hold the office of president of the United States”.Not too long after Johnson made that remark, Donald Trump went on to win that office. And today Johnson – having defied similar assessments of his own fitness for the highest office – will come face to face with him at the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz, on the sidelines of the G7 summit, in his first major event on the international stage as prime minister.Both men rose to the top by portraying themselves as outsiders who were prepared to break some furniture in pursuit of an imagined national greatness. Now they must rearrange that furniture, or make some of their own.Johnson flew into Biarritz after meetings with his counterparts in Berlin and Paris, meetings which appear to have brought them no closer to a Brexit deal.At the three-day summit in Biarritz, amid the grandeur of the historic seaside resort on France’s Atlantic coast, the prime minister will be under particular scrutiny. Every word and gesture from Johnson at this annual gathering of the world’s major industrial democracies will be analysed for clues as to where he intends to position the UK on the gaping transatlantic divide between the US and Europe.If the past is any guide, the prime minister will try to avoid giving away that location, and if Trump has an interest in helping him, he will not put on him on the spot when it comes to issues and instincts on which the UK has thus far been on the European side.Those pivotal issues include UK support for the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran; backing for the Paris climate accord and acknowledgement of the urgency of the climate crisis, particularly against the blazing backdrop of the Amazon wildfires.The UK has maintained its support for an international rules-based system with multilateral institutions and free trade at its centre. It has promoted a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine and a rejection of both occupation and annexation of Palestinian territories. Britain has also maintained a firm line over the Russian military intervention in Ukraine and Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, denying Russia readmission to the G7 club until it reverses those actions.These are all shibboleths of the liberal international order, and they are being challenged daily by the Trump administration. Would a no-deal Brexit mean that Britain felt under pressure to do the same?Since taking over as prime minister, Johnson has stuck to the consensus European script on all these critical foreign policy issues.He has restated his faith in the nuclear agreement and the need to defuse tensions in the Gulf, rather than tighten the US stranglehold on Iran.Johnson has also warned against the dangers of trade wars, in the face of Trump’s worsening face-off with China, and he has stuck to European orthodoxy on the need to preserve the Paris accord on climate, and to build on it.Any substantial deviation at the G7 summit from such entrenched, shared positions would mean Johnson risking the toxic label of “poodle”, which his predecessor Tony Blair never managed to shake off.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is already framing Johnson as a “Trump first” prime minister, and there will be plenty of jilted European partners on hand to draw attention to British humiliation.Emmanuel Macron, when asked last week if he thought that Johnson and Trump would team up together in a united front against other Europeans at the G7, played on deep British fears about the future.“I don’t think it’s Boris Johnson’s project or the British people’s project, as Britain leaves the EU saying it wants a bigger space in the world, to then become the junior partner of the US,” the French president told reporters last week.He said any future trade deal between the US and the UK would not make up for the UK’s geographical and strategic links to Europe, and a trade deal with the US could come at a high price for Britain: a “historic vassalisation” to the US.It is unlikely Macron chose his words carelessly. Johnson first signalled his break from Theresa May at the end of 2017 by warning that the UK must not become a “vassal state” of Europe. With the EU, the UK had one of the bigger seats at the table, but in the absence of a withdrawal agreement with Europe, Britain approaches the US as a junior partner at best, a supplicant at worst.Johnson has insisted that he will defend British agriculture and the National Health Service against the predations of US corporations, but that will be harder if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal, a course of action Trump and his administration have repeatedly advocated. Johnson’s readiness to embrace such an outcome distinguishes him from Theresa May, and is arguably the most important reason Trump openly preferred him to his predecessor.On this issue at least, Johnson has, with his brinksmanship, placed himself closer to Trump and further from the EU. The European Council president, Donald Tusk, drily noted that when he meets Johnson on Sunday, he will be the third Tory prime minister with whom he has sat down to discuss Brexit. He warned Johnson on Saturday that he risked going down in history as “Mr No Deal”.On the way to Biarritz, Johnson sought to defend his strategy of blaming Britain’s EU partners for failing to come up with a solution to the Irish backstop impasse.“I don’t want a no-deal Brexit but I say to our EU friends if they don’t want no deal they have got to get rid of the backstop from the treaty,” Johnson told reporters. “If Donald Tusk doesn’t want to go down in history as Mr No-Deal Brexit, then I hope this point will be borne in mind by him too.”Trump, ironically for a self-proclaimed master of the deal, can be expected to continue to pull in the other direction, seeking to persuade the prime minister that “Mr No Deal” would be a badge of pride.In the absence of specifics, both Trump and Johnson will seek to play up the manly bonhomie of a renewed “special relationship”. The US president will want to show he has at least one friend in Biarritz, the man he proudly referred to as “Britain [sic] Trump”, and has shown that he is prepared to overlook past slights in special circumstances.For his part, Johnson – who declared only a few years ago that the only reason he would avoid some parts of New York was “the real risk of meeting Donald Trump” – must seek to show he can connect more successfully with the US president that his hapless predecessor.Both men will paint a rosy picture of a future US-UK trade deal, because the ugly reality of the negotiations can be put off until later. At some point post-Brexit, the UK will have to make a decision on whether its regulatory standards are to converge with the US or with the EU.It cannot do both. Converging with the US would be likely to involve breaking promises about British food, agriculture and animal welfare as well as the National Health Service.Moreover, any trade deal with the US would have to gain approval from Congress, and the House of Representatives will be in no mood to cooperate if Brexit has an impact on the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland. The Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has repeatedly said there is “no way whatsoever” a US-UK free trade deal would be approved if Brexit affected the border between the two Irelands.So whatever the upbeat noises about future trade Trump and Johnson make on Sunday, it will mean little in real terms. The rest will be mood music, and Johnson has shown himself adept in that department. The G7 is a big stage, but not a particularly challenging act. There are set scripts and orthodoxies to follow.But as ever, Trump is the wild card, constantly threatening to upset the comfortable western consensus of years past. If he so chooses, the president could set the rejuvenated special relationship with the man he has frequently called his friend, and force Johnson to make the hard choices he is hoping to postpone until after an election.",Boris Johnson prepares for Biarritz balancing act with Donald Trump,2019-08-24/19:00:46,boris johnson will sit down for breakfast on sunday morning with a man he once

went on to win that office and today johnson having defied similar assessments of his own fitness for the highest office will come face to face with him at the hôtel du palais in biarritz on the sidelines of the g summit in his first major event on the international stage as prime minister both men rose to the top by portraying themselves as outsiders who were prepared to break some furniture in pursuit of an imagined national greatness now they must rearrange that furniture or make some of their own johnson flew into biarritz after meetings with his counterparts in berlin and paris meetings which appear to have brought them no closer to a brexit deal at the three day summit in biarritz amid the grandeur of the historic seaside resort on france s atlantic coast the prime minister will be under particular scrutiny every word and gesture from johnson at this annual gathering of the world s major industrial democracies will be analysed for clues as to where he intends to position the uk on the gaping transatlantic divide between the us and europe if the past is any guide the prime minister will try to avoid giving away that location and if trump has an interest in helping him he will not put on him on the spot when it comes to issues and instincts on which the uk has thus far been on the european side those pivotal issues include uk support for the  nuclear deal with iran backing for the paris climate accord and acknowledgement of the urgency of the climate crisis particularly against the blazing backdrop of the amazon wildfires the uk has maintained its support for an international rules based system with multilateral institutions and free trade at its centre it has promoted a two state solution for israel and palestine and a rejection of both occupation and annexation of palestinian territories britain has also maintained a firm line over the russian military intervention in ukraine and moscow s annexation of crimea denying russia readmission to the g club until it reverses those actions these are all shibboleths of the liberal international order and they are being challenged daily by the trump administration would a no deal brexit mean that britain felt under pressure to do the same since taking over as prime minister johnson has stuck to the consensus european script on all these critical foreign policy issues he has restated his faith in the nuclear agreement and the need to defuse tensions in the gulf rather than tighten the us stranglehold on iran johnson has also warned against the dangers of trade wars in the face of trump s worsening face off with china and he has stuck to european orthodoxy on the need to preserve the paris accord on climate and to build on it any substantial deviation at the g summit from such entrenched shared positions would mean johnson risking the toxic label of poodle which his predecessor tony blair never managed to shake off the labour leader jeremy corbyn is already framing johnson as a trump first prime minister and there will be plenty of jilted european partners on hand to draw attention to british humiliation emmanuel macron when asked last week if he thought that johnson and trump would team up together in a united front against other europeans at the g played on deep british fears about the future i don t think it s boris johnson s project or the british people s project as britain leaves the eu saying it wants a bigger space in the world to then become the junior partner of the us the french president told reporters last week he said any future trade deal between the us and the uk would not make up for the uk s geographical and strategic links to europe and a trade deal with the us could come at a high price for britain a historic vassalisation to the us it is unlikely macron chose his words carelessly johnson first signalled his break from theresa may at the end of  by warning that the uk must not become a vassal state of europe with the eu the uk had one of the bigger seats at the table but in the absence of a withdrawal agreement with europe britain approaches the us as a junior partner at best a supplicant at worst johnson has insisted that he will defend british agriculture and the national health service against the predations of us corporations but that will be harder if the uk crashes out of the eu without a deal a course of action trump and his administration have repeatedly advocated johnson s readiness to embrace such an outcome distinguishes him from theresa may and is arguably the most important reason trump openly preferred him to his predecessor on this issue at least johnson has with his brinksmanship placed himself closer to trump and further from the eu the european council president donald tusk drily noted that when he meets johnson on sunday he will be the third tory prime minister with whom he has sat down to discuss brexit he warned johnson on saturday that he risked going down in history as mr no deal on the way to biarritz johnson sought to defend his strategy of blaming britain s eu partners for failing to come up with a solution to the irish backstop impasse i don t want a no deal brexit but i say to our eu friends if they don t want no deal they have got to get rid of the backstop from the treaty johnson told reporters if donald tusk doesn t want to go down in history as mr no deal brexit then i hope this point will be borne in mind by him too trump ironically for a self proclaimed master of the deal can be expected to continue to pull in the other direction seeking to persuade the prime minister that mr no deal would be a badge of pride in the absence of specifics both trump and johnson will seek to play up the manly bonhomie of a renewed special relationship the us president will want to show he has at least one friend in biarritz the man he proudly referred to as britain sic trump and has shown that he is prepared to overlook past slights in special circumstances for his part johnson who declared only a few years ago that the only reason he would avoid some parts of new york was the real risk of meeting donald trump must seek to show he can connect more successfully with the us president that his hapless predecessor both men will paint a rosy picture of a future us uk trade deal because the ugly reality of the negotiations can be put off until later at some point post brexit the uk will have to make a decision on whether its regulatory standards are to converge with the us or with the eu it cannot do both converging with the us would be likely to involve breaking promises about british food agriculture and animal welfare as well as the national health service moreover any trade deal with the us would have to gain approval from congress and the house of representatives will be in no mood to cooperate if brexit has an impact on the good friday peace agreement in northern ireland the democratic speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi has repeatedly said there is no way whatsoever a us uk free trade deal would be approved if brexit affected the border between the two irelands so whatever the upbeat noises about future trade trump and johnson make on sunday it will mean little in real terms the rest will be mood music and johnson has shown himself adept in that department the g is a big stage but not a particularly challenging act there are set scripts and orthodoxies to follow but as ever trump is the wild card constantly threatening to upset the comfortable western consensus of years past if he so chooses the president could set the rejuvenated special relationship with the man he has frequently called his friend and force johnson to make the hard choices he is hoping to postpone until after an election ,Brexit,0.217407838
7476,"The European Union has rebuffed Boris Johnson’s attempts to tear up the Irish backstop, in a coordinated response that appeared to close the door on further meaningful Brexit negotiations.In remarks shortly before the prime minister departed for a whistle-stop tour to meet European leaders, Johnson put the blame for the EU’s hardline response at the feet of Conservative rebels, claiming his negotiating strategy was being undermined by those who said they could prevent no deal.The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, accused the British government of failing to admit that its policies would lead to the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.As the standoff played out, the government confirmed that British officials would stop attending most EU meetings from 1 September, a move denounced by critics as showing contempt for British influence in Brussels and allies across Europe.Johnson suggested the EU’s position was influenced by the manoeuvres of Conservative MPs who have been examining legislative methods to stop no deal in the House of Commons, including former cabinet ministers like Philip Hammond.Downing Street has insisted that leaving on 31 October cannot be stopped by any means, even if parliament were to pass legislation.“One thing that slightly, I think, complicates the picture is that our EU friends still clearly think that there is a possibility that parliament will block Brexit,” the prime minister said. “And as long as they think there’s a possibility that parliament will block Brexit they are unlikely to be minded to make the concessions that we need. So it is going to take a bit of patience.”The standoff set the stage for tense encounters between Johnson and Angela Merkel in Berlin and Emmanuel Macron in Paris, before a gathering of G7 leaders on Saturday.The German chancellor is expected to dismiss Johnson’s call to scrap the backstop when she meets him on Wednesday.“The letter to the president of the European council is not a serious offer, and Boris Johnson knows it,” said Norbert Röttgen, an ally of Merkel who heads the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee. “If Johnson really wanted to achieve something on his visits to Paris and Berlin, he would have been well advised against writing this letter.”Variously described as an insurance policy or safety net, the backstop is a device in the withdrawal agreement intended to ensure that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements.It would mean that if there were no workable agreement on such matters, Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union and much of the single market, guaranteeing a friction-free border with the Republic. This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU’s customs union permanently if the UK & EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc. Joint interpretative instrument A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU’s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.Unilateral statement from the UK This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.Additional language in political declaration This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, it failed to persuade the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it ‘reduces the risk’ of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it.Boris Johnson declared the Northern Ireland backstop ‘dead’ during his leadership campaign, and promised to throw it out of any deal he renegotiated with the EU. The EU has repeatedly stated that it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement for renegotiation. Daniel Boffey, Martin Belam and Peter Walker Tusk, who is also expected to meet Johnson this weekend, wrote: “The backstop is an insurance to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland unless and until an alternative is found. Those against the backstop and not proposing realistic alternatives in fact support re-establishing a border. Even if they do not admit it.”In a sign of the EU’s carefully coordinated response, the European commission issued its own statement minutes later saying it shared Tusk’s view.A commission spokeswoman welcomed the UK government’s “engagement and commitment to an orderly withdrawal” while making clear its objections.“We also note that the letter does not provide a legal operational solution to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland,” she said. “It does not set out what any alternative arrangements could be and in fact it recognises that there is no guarantee that such arrangements will be in place by the end of the transitional period.”Johnson admitted that the EU’s position was “a bit negative” but suggested Brussels must acknowledge the deal had been summarily rejected by the UK parliament.“I saw what Donald Tusk had to say, and it wasn’t redolent of a sense of optimism,” he said. “But I think, actually, we will get there. I think there’s a real sense now that something needs to be done with this backstop.”The prime minister said the UK had no intention of introducing any sort of new border checks or infrastructure at the Irish border. “It’s a bit of a paradox because it is the other side, a bit odd, the other side of the argument, the EU, who seem to think it might be necessary to have checks for them to preserve the integrity of the single market,” he said.Johnson had dashed any prospect of an early compromise in a letter on Monday night when he called on the EU to scrap the backstop, which he said was anti-democratic and “inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK as a state”.The letter was addressed to Tusk, who chairs EU summits. Copies were also sent to EU27 leaders and the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.As the EU made its first public statements, diplomats from the 27 countries were sent an analysis that described key arguments in Johnson’s letter as incorrect and misleading.The internal document seen by the Guardian states it was “incorrect” to suggest the people of Northern Ireland would have no influence over EU laws that applied to them, pointing to provisions in the Brexit agreement.Officials had already strongly rejected Johnson’s claim that the backstop was anti-democratic, pointing to the fact Northern Ireland had voted to remain in the EU and non-unionist parties were in favour of the backstop.Johnson’s claim that it would be possible for two separate legal and economic jurisdictions to exist on the island of Ireland with an open border was judged “misleading” as EU law provided “the common framework needed to enable frictionless trade between member states today”.While the EU has said it was ready to examine alternative arrangements to the backstop, officials have stressed that no such options exist today anywhere in the world.Neale Richmond, an Irish senator, said Johnson’s claim that the backstop posed a threat to the Good Friday agreement was “very disappointing language”.“The negotiations ended in November,” he told BBC Radio 4. “The British government in good faith agreed the withdrawal agreement. And the backstop isn’t impossible to get out of; that is simply misleading. However, it cannot be unilaterally exited by one state. What’s the point of the backstop if one side can simply just rip it up?”He ruled out a time limit on the backstop. “It is an insurance policy to protect a very fragile peace deal, therefore it needs the buy-in of both sides, because both the British and Irish government are co-guarantors of that Good Friday agreement.”An Irish government source played down the significance of Johnson’s letter, saying: “The letter just reiterates the British government’s position. The EU position remains clear. The withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated and the backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement.”The backstop was consistent with the Good Friday agreement and did not undermine the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, an analysis that London shared during and after negotiations, the source said. “It’s disappointing that the British government cannot stand over the commitment it gave in 2017 and 2018.”Guy Verhofstadt, who chairs the European parliament’s Brexit steering group, tweeted he did not see any majority in the UK parliament to remove the backstop. “It is a vital insurance policy, negotiated in good faith and supported by the people of the island of Ireland. The time for bluster and political blame games is fast running out.”Last week a leaked German government paper revealed that Berlin saw a “high probability” of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October as it was currently unforeseeable that Johnson would change his “tough negotiating position”.Additional reporting by Rory Carroll in Dublin and Philip Oltermann in Berlin.",EU rejects Boris Johnson request to

7485,"As the UK races towards a potential no-deal Brexit, President Donald Trump is cheering it on. But Brexit – especially without a deal in place with the European Union – would be bad for the US-UK special relationship and would make the UK a much less important US ally.The ramifications of Brexit – in particular without a deal with the EU that pleases everyone – could be explosive. It could hurt the UK economy at a time when Trump’s trade war and economic policies are increasing the risk of a global recession, and threaten the very integrity of the UK amid growing signals that Northern Ireland and Scotland would consider breaking away. Boris Johnson appears willing to drive Britain off this cliff come hell or high water, threatening a no-deal Brexit and saying that the UK will leave the EU by the end of October, “do or die”. Everyone hopes that the UK finds a way out of this mess, but the past few years haven’t provided much evidence to believe that it will end well.Trump has long supported Brexit. He made that support clear during his presidential campaign and has expressed it repeatedly as president. Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, now appears to be doing what he can to ensure Brexit happens. When in the UK recently, Bolton tried to incentivise Brexit by dangling the possibility of a trade deal with the US after the UK leaves the EU, saying that the UK would be at the “front of the trade queue” for a deal.But that won’t happen. First, the politics in the US right now mean that it is incredibly difficult to pass any trade deals, even with America’s closest allies. Second, and more important, US congressional leaders have already signalled that a deal would be dead on arrival in Congress if Brexit affects the situation in Northern Ireland. As the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said: “If Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress.”In fact, the reality of a post-Brexit US-UK alliance could be just the opposite of the false promises being peddled by Trump and Bolton: the longer-term impacts of Brexit could include a significantly downgraded relationship between the two nations. It’s been a long time since the UK was the global power it once was, but it’s still a vital US ally. From diplomatic cooperation at the UN, to supporting the Iran nuclear deal, to working together in Nato, there are endless examples of how a strong alliance – and a strong UK – is in the US interest.But if the UK leaves the EU – especially without a deal – its influence and power will decrease markedly. It would no longer be able to influence EU decisions on economic matters in a bloc that constitutes the world’s second largest economy and with which the US traded $1.3tn in goods and services in 2018. It would no longer be able to influence the EU position on challenges such as Russia and China. If a no-deal Brexit causes a rift within the UK by pushing Scotland towards independence or undermining the Good Friday agreement, it will have even less bandwidth to play a positive role around the world. And if Brexit damages the UK economy, it will likely mean a UK with less global economic and military power.While a post-Brexit UK is still likely to be one of the world’s largest economies and will retain its seat on the UN security council, it will be less important to US national security and economic interests. In addition, if the UK and EU remain at odds over significant economic and political issues in the wake of Brexit, it could place the US in an awkward position between close allies in the UK and on the rest of the continent.Furthermore, Brexit won’t make the serious policy disagreements between the Trump administration and the UK magically disappear. For instance, the two have been at odds over the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and whether to allow the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to do business in Britain. It seems unlikely that the Trump administration would be willing to give the UK a break on those issues in the event of Brexit – just look at the recent spat with Britain over whether to release an Iranian oil tanker detained in Gibraltar.While some might believe that Trump and Johnson’s relationship as kindred demagogic spirits could help buoy the alliance in the wake of Brexit, it should be clear by now that the two leaders are driven by their own political interests and are willing to damage the special relationship if it advances their own personal positions.Trump has no interest in the US-UK alliance – he’s an agent of chaos, and supporting Brexit is yet another way for him to upend international norms. Trump’s disdain for allies should be fair warning to those who think the president might be willing to offer fair trade terms to Britain. As analyst Jeremy Shapiro points out, what we know so far about the terms for a US-UK deal “reveals that it is very much an ‘America first’ effort”. Faith in Trump to help a US ally is misplaced. “Our allies take advantage of us far more than our enemies,” Trump said at a recent rally.If the current UK government believes that the US will shower rewards on Britain in the wake of Brexit, or that it will somehow bail Britain out, they’re wrong. Many policymakers in America will stick with the UK because of the longstanding alliance, but it could be a diminished alliance. And that would be bad for both countries.• Michael H Fuchs is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and a former deputy assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific

And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Jeremy Corbyn will promise to do “everything necessary to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit” as he delivers a speech on Monday in which he will accuse Boris Johnson of being a “fake populist and phoney outsider” in the mould of Donald Trump.The Labour leader will give a flagship speech in the key marginal seat of Corby in the east Midlands as speculation grows about an election in the coming weeks.Following the leak of documents warning of protests and food shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Corbyn will attack Johnson for the Conservative party’s “failure on Brexit, and its lurch to the hard right, which has provoked the crisis our country faces this autumn”.The shadow chancellor said on Monday morning that Labour wanted to see parliament reconvened “in the next few days” to work to avoid a no-deal Brexit.But John McDonnell insisted during an interview on the BBC’s Today programme that it was “non-negotiable” that the Labour leader should be the figure who leads any caretaker government that could emerge.Downing Street has blamed the disclosure of detailed preparations being made under Operation Yellowhammer on a hostile former minister intent on ruining Johnson’s trip to see EU leaders this week as he also prepares to make his debut at a G7 summit.The leaked document argues that the most likely scenario is severe extended delays to medicine supplies and shortages of some fresh foods, combined with price rises, if there is a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.Michael Gove, the cabinet minister responsible for no-deal planning, insisted Yellowhammer represented a “worst-case scenario” and said “significant” steps had been taken in the last three weeks to accelerate planning.But separate leaks also show that planning of a different kind – for a general election – is being ramped up.The prime minister’s No 10 operation is increasingly on an election footing, with leaked internal emails revealing he was due to meet Sir Lynton Crosby, the election guru who worked on the campaigns of David Cameron in 2015 and Theresa May in 2017.Johnson’s planned meetings with the French president and German chancellor come ahead of the G7 summit in Biarritz at the end of the week, where the PM is likely to meet the US president, Donald Trump, for talks about a potential post-Brexit trade deal.The general assumption of observers is that no one should expect a breakthrough from Johnson’s visits to Berlin and Paris to meet Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. He is scheduled to hold a working lunch on Thursday with Macron at the Elysée and issue a joint declaration.In terms of political positioning, he is expected to cling to a hardline message on Brexit and the intention of his government for Britain to leave on 31 October.For now, his position is that formal talks on Brexit will only take place until the Northern Ireland backstop is removed from the withdrawal agreement negotiated by his predecessor in No 10.Don’t expect much in the way of comment from European leaders about Operation Yellowhammer, although the Financial Times reports one senior EU official as saying that Johnson must come to the G7 with a credible proposal to prevent a hard border in Ireland.“The first thing to know is what detailed plan on avoiding a hard border Johnson has in mind – a plan that is compatible with the existing withdrawal agreement,” the official said.Looking ahead to the G7, where the ever-unpredictable Trump is likely to give an edge to proceedings, the summit marks the first real test of Johnson on the international stage (although other states will be familiar with his approach from his time as foreign secretary). One scenario being sketched out by some was the possibility of a Trump-Johnson alliance of sorts.Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP who chairs the influential Commons foreign affairs committee, said it would be interesting to see if the meeting of leaders became “another six and one, or five and two” with the UK becoming even more part of the “American camp”.Tugendhat told the BBC’s Today programme that the UK could play the role, as it had done in the past, of a “bridge” between other states and the US.That’s not quite a scenario other European leaders appear to be contemplating. British officials have been liaising with their EU counterparts on how to get on the right side of the trade war between the US and China, and are already treading a diplomatic fine line over the European-backed Iranian nuclear deal opposed by Trump.“This is a diplomatic quagmire of a G7,” one European diplomat told the Guardian.All is meanwhile being done in Brussels to get things right on the European side and to avoid a repetition of the Salzburg summit where Theresa May was seen to have been humiliated.“A frosty approach would be self-defeating,” an EU official said, while admitting that Donald Tusk, president of the European council, who will also attend, did not always toe the line.Avoiding no deal must be the “number one priority” for the government, according to Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI.The home secretary, Priti Patel, is pressing for freedom of movement by European nationals into the UK to end on 31 October under a no-deal Brexit, according to reports.Dominic Grieve has accused Johnson of “behaving like a demagogue” and said the UK prime minister’s rhetoric had led directly to him receiving death threats.As many as 40 Tory MPs are backing an attempt led by two former cabinet ministers, Philip Hammond and David Gauke, to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, the Telegraph has reported.British house hunters have launched a surprise August buying spree before the scheduled Brexit date, with new data showing sales reached their highest point since 2015 during the usually sleepy summer period.Brexit party politicians have appeared on programmes that have hosted conspiracy theorists and promoted the views of prominent figures on the hard right, an analysis has found.The Democratic Unionist party has been attempting to play down the results of a poll that found almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.As many as 40,000 motorists in Ireland who are still driving with a UK licence are being warned they have just weeks to exchange it or face being put off the road in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, has said that other members of parliament must return to the House of Commons to hold an “increasingly reckless” Boris Johnson to account.Matthew d’Ancona, the Guardian columnist and chairman of the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue, argues that what matters now is how those in politics who want to prevent the UK experiencing a “historic disaster” respond to the challenge; how imaginative they are prepared to be; and whether they are ready to put nation before party:Let us address the bearded elephant in the room. I think I have made it fairly clear that I do not want Jeremy Corbyn to become prime minister and that I firmly believe he is not up to the job. But – if Johnson loses a vote of no confidence in September, triggering a 14-day period in which, by law, any MP can seek to form an alternative government – it is self-evident that Corbyn will be at the heart of any such discussions, ex officio, as leader of the opposition. I might wish that Stella Creasy or Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn held that post. But none of them does.With such a high-profile journalist as @OwenJones84 being subject to a premeditated attack, it's worth remembering that journalists were among the very first targets of fascists

7567,"For weeks things have been quiet in the summer heat. But in recent days the normal diplomatic back-channelling between London, Brussels, Paris, Berlin and Rome has cranked into gear before the G7 meeting in Biarritz of the world’s most advanced economies.British officials have been liaising with their EU counterparts on how to get on the right side of the trade war between the US and China, tread a diplomatic fine line over the European-backed Iranian nuclear deal opposed by Donald Trump and get the rhetoric right on the precarious situation in Hong Kong in the presence of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “This is a diplomatic quagmire of a G7,” said a European diplomat.But that quagmire is not restricted to the US, Canada and Japan. Britain and the other EU countries in attendance – France, Germany and Italy – have plenty of tensions of their own.“They were nervous, and that makes us nervous,” an EU source said of talks with officials in Whitehall about Boris Johnson’s first appearance as a head of government on the world stage.There is currently no relationship between the power players in the EU and the new British government, and there is very little trust.Everything that Johnson has done so far in power is seen as being for domestic consumption, and, to a large extent, that is expected to continue. Some fear a “big moment” from Johnson in Biarritz at which he seeks to blame Brussels for the Brexit impasse and help along the dangerous slide to a no-deal exit.But hope also springs eternal that the new prime minister will at some point add some ballast to the claim that he genuinely wants to leave the European Union with a deal. Biarritz is again seen as being as good a point as any.“We believe that the UK is willing to leave the EU on 31 October,” a source said. “We do not have any evidence yet that the UK wants to negotiate a deal.”All is being done in Brussels to get things right on the European side and to avoid a repetition of the Salzburg summit where Theresa May was seen to have been humiliated. “A frosty approach would be self-defeating,” an EU official said, while admitting that Donald Tusk, president of the European council, who will also attend, doesn’t always toe the line.Everything has been contemplated, from the tone of the speeches to how to deal with an unlikely, but not unthinkable, attempt by Trump to give “the art of the deal” a go in the Brexit negotiations.Perhaps those meetings and Biarritz will be a reality check for JohnsonOn the British side, there appears to be some willing. Johnson is to speak on the phone to Ireland’s prime minister Leo Varadkar as well as to Tusk this week.More significantly, he will leave the comfort of Downing Street and the bubble of advisers led by Dominic Cummings for Paris and Berlin to meet Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel for the first time since becoming prime minister. “Perhaps those meetings and Biarritz will be a reality check,” said an EU diplomat intimately involved in the Brexit negotiations.Johnson’s claims to want to renegotiate the deal appear empty so far given his insistence that the UK will leave on 31 October, which leaves little time for a serious rethink. There have not been any proposals sent Brussels’ way.“They have made it easy for the EU side in a way,” said a source. “If they came up with a 15-year time limit on the backstop or some way in which the people of Northern Ireland had a regular opportunity to vote in favour of exiting the backstop, you might have some more difficult conversations.“But that is a million miles from where we are.”When Johnson’s EU adviser David Frost visited Brussels recently he admitted that even without the backstop there was no guarantee the withdrawal agreement would be backed by parliament.“So the position is get rid of the backstop and then we will see what else we don’t like?” asked one diplomat. “Where’s the incentive for us?”In reality, August may just be an ordeal to get through for both sides. “It depends on what Boris Johnson really wants,” a rueful diplomat concluded.",G7 leaders wait nervously for Boris Johnson’s debut on the world stage,2019-08-18/09:00:06,for weeks things have been quiet in the summer heat but in recent days the normal diplomatic back channelling between london brussels paris berlin and rome has cranked into gear before the g meeting in biarritz of the world s most advanced economies british officials have been liaising with their eu counterparts on how to get on the right side of the trade war between the us and china tread a diplomatic fine line over the european backed iranian nuclear deal opposed by donald trump and get the rhetoric right on the precarious situation in hong kong in the presence of the chinese leader xi jinping this is a diplomatic quagmire of a g said a european diplomat but that quagmire is not restricted to the us canada and japan britain and the other eu countries in attendance france germany and italy have plenty of tensions of their own they were nervous and that makes us nervous an eu source said of talks with officials in whitehall about boris johnson s first appearance as a head of government on the world stage there is currently no relationship between the power players in the eu and the new british government and there is very little trust everything that johnson has done so far in power is seen as being for domestic consumption and to a large extent that is expected to continue some fear a big moment from johnson in biarritz at which he seeks to blame brussels for the brexit impasse and help along the dangerous slide to a no deal exit but hope also springs eternal that the new prime minister will at some point add some ballast to the claim that he genuinely wants to leave the european union with a deal biarritz is again seen as being as good a point as any we believe that the uk is willing to leave the eu on  october a source said we do not have any evidence yet that the uk wants to negotiate a deal all is being done in brussels to get things right on the european side and to avoid a repetition of the salzburg summit where theresa may was seen to have been humiliated a frosty approach would be self defeating an eu official said while admitting that donald tusk president of the european council who will also attend doesn t always toe the line everything has been contemplated from the tone of the speeches to how to deal with an unlikely but not unthinkable attempt by trump to give the art of the deal a go in the brexit negotiations perhaps those meetings and biarritz will be a reality check for johnsonon the british side there appears to be some willing johnson is to speak on the phone to ireland s prime minister leo varadkar as well as to tusk this week more significantly he will leave the comfort of downing street and the bubble of advisers led by dominic cummings for paris and berlin to meet emmanuel macron and angela merkel for the first time since becoming prime minister perhaps those meetings and biarritz will be a reality check said an eu diplomat intimately involved in the brexit negotiations johnson s claims to want to renegotiate the deal appear empty so far given his insistence that the uk will leave on  october which leaves little time for a serious rethink there have not been any proposals sent brussels way they have made it easy for the eu side in a way said a source if they came up with a  year time limit on the backstop or some way in which the people of northern ireland had a regular opportunity to vote in favour of exiting the backstop you might have some more difficult conversations but that is a million miles from where we are when johnson s eu adviser david frost visited brussels recently he admitted that even without the backstop there was no guarantee the withdrawal agreement would be backed by parliament so the position is get rid of the backstop and then we will see what else we don t like asked one diplomat where s the incentive for us in reality august may just be an ordeal to get through for both sides it depends on what boris johnson really wants a rueful diplomat concluded ,Brexit,0.235007167
7701,"Philip Hammond has told Boris Johnson that leaving the EU without a deal would be a betrayal of the referendum result, as the former chancellor led a group of 20 Conservatives making clear their opposition to crashing out on 31 October.In a sign that some Tory MPs are determined to block a no-deal Brexit, Hammond appeared to blame Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s senior adviser, for making demands for a new deal that the EU “cannot and will not accede to”.Writing in the Times, he said: “The hardliners may make the most noise but they are not the most numerous. Most people in this country want to see us leave in a smooth and orderly fashion that will not disrupt lives, cost jobs or diminish living standards, whether they voted leave or remain in 2016. No deal would be a betrayal of the 2016 referendum result. It must not happen.”In an apparent swipe at Cummings, he said: “The unelected people who pull the strings of this government know that this is a demand the EU cannot, and will not, accede to. Not just because they will be stubborn in their defence of the single market (although they will), but because the fragility of their own coalition of 27 means any attempt on their side to reopen the package would see their unity collapse. They will not take that chance and the smart people in Whitehall know it.”A senior Downing Street source said: “Philip Hammond actively undermined the government’s negotiating position by frustrating and obstructing preparation to leave the EU. Everyone knows that the ex-chancellor’s real objective was to cancel the referendum result.”The former chancellor is leading a group of 20 Tories, including seven former cabinet ministers, who have written to Johnson accusing him of setting the bar too high in negotiations with the EU to have a hope of getting changes to a deal.Signed by Greg Clark, David Gauke, Rory Stewart and others, the letter says: “We are alarmed by the ‘red lines’ you have drawn which, on the face of it, appear to eliminate the chance of reaching agreement with the EU”.The intervention is a sign that Tories opposed to a no-deal Brexit are prepared to vote with opposition parties to prevent Johnson taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October without a deal.At the same time, John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, vowed at an Edinburgh festival fringe event to fight attempts to sideline parliament “with every breath in my body”. He said he would insist on the right of parliament to continue to sit and debate.Cummings, the architect of the Vote Leave campaign, has told staff in No 10 that the rebels are too late to stop a no-deal Brexit, as the prime minister could simply push it through on 31 October and hold an election afterwards.However, his opponents are incensed by the idea that parliament could be sidelined and have been working over the summer on ways to prevent that happening. These include a confidence vote to replace Johnson as prime minister with a temporary government or passing a law to force him to extend article 50.Johnson insists that he wants a deal with the EU but only one that does not include the “undemocratic backstop” – the insurance mechanism to stop a hard border on the island of Ireland that Brussels says must be a part of the deal.Since taking office, the prime minster has ramped up preparations for leaving without a deal in a move to convince the EU he is serious about leaving on 31 October regardless of whether the UK has a withdrawal agreement in place.","No-deal Brexit would be a betrayal, says Philip Hammond",2019-08-13/23:36:42,philip hammond has told boris johnson that leaving the eu without a deal would be a betrayal of the referendum result as the former chancellor led a group of  conservatives making clear their opposition to crashing out on  october in a sign that some tory mps are determined to block a no deal brexit hammond appeared to blame dominic cummings johnson s senior adviser for making demands for a new deal that the eu cannot and will not accede to writing in the times he said the hardliners may make the most noise but they are not the most numerous most people in this country want to see us leave in a smooth and orderly fashion that will not disrupt lives cost jobs or diminish living standards whether they voted leave or remain in  no deal would be a betrayal of the  referendum result it must not happen in an apparent swipe at cummings he said the unelected people who pull the strings of this government know that this is a demand the eu cannot and will not accede to not just because they will be stubborn in their defence of the single market although they will but because the fragility of their own coalition of  means any attempt on their side to reopen the package would see their unity collapse they will not take that chance and the smart people in whitehall know it a senior downing street source said philip hammond actively undermined the government s negotiating position by frustrating and obstructing preparation to leave the eu everyone knows that the ex chancellor s real objective was to cancel the referendum result the former chancellor is leading a group of  tories including seven former cabinet ministers who have written to johnson accusing him of setting the bar too high in negotiations with the eu to have a hope of getting changes to a deal signed by greg clark david gauke rory stewart and others the letter says we are alarmed by the red lines you have drawn which on the face of it appear to eliminate the chance of reaching agreement with the eu the intervention is a sign that tories opposed to a no deal brexit are prepared to vote with opposition parties to prevent johnson taking the uk out of the eu on  october without a deal at the same time john bercow the speaker of the house of commons vowed at an edinburgh festival fringe event to fight attempts to sideline parliament with every breath in my body he said he would insist on the right of parliament to continue to sit and debate cummings the architect of the vote leave campaign has told staff in no  that the rebels are too late to stop a no deal brexit as the prime minister could simply push it through on  october and hold an election afterwards however his opponents are incensed by the idea that parliament could be sidelined and have been working over the summer on ways to prevent that happening these include a confidence vote to replace johnson as prime minister with a temporary government or passing a law to force him to extend article  johnson insists that he wants a deal with the eu but only one that does not include the undemocratic backstop the insurance mechanism to stop a hard border on the island of ireland that brussels says must be a part of the deal since taking office the prime minster has ramped up preparations for leaving without a deal in a move to convince the eu he is serious about leaving on  october regardless of whether the uk has a withdrawal agreement in place ,Brexit,0.292097598
7739,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Amid growing certainty that the UK is heading intentionally towards a no-deal Brexit, No 10 refused to rule out scheduling an early November election for immediately after Britain leaves the EU on 31 October if Boris Johnson loses a confidence motion.Insisting that he wanted a deal but that Theresa May’s “doesn’t work”, Johnson urged the EU to show “common sense”. But his top aide, Dominic Cummings, said the government could call elections for after 31 October and leave anyway if it loses a confidence vote.Michael Gove, in charge of no-deal preparations, ramped up the rhetoric, accusing the EU 27 of intransigence and calling it “wrong and sad”, while the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, insisted during a visit to the US that Brexit would bring “a huge series of upsides” for the UK in international trade.As the Irish government again said the backstop would not be up for renegotiation at a meeting next month between the PM and Leo Varadkar, No 10 reinforced its “do or die” Brexit message by suggesting that UK diplomats would be pulled out of the EU’s institutional structures of power in Brussels within days.It was also revealed that Johnson’s chief of staff had cancelled all leave for Downing Street advisers until 31 October, further increasing already fevered speculation about the likelihood of a snap election in the aftermath of a no-deal Brexit.Meanwhile, fears that the UK could be heading for its first recession in a decade were stoked by grim official figures showing that the economy had contracted in the second quarter – and parliamentary resistance to the Johnson/Cummings plan stiffened.A cross-party group of MPs began working on a plan to thwart a no-deal Brexit on 31 October by forcing parliament to sit through the autumn recess, while Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the cabinet secretary saying a no-deal Brexit during an election campaign would be an “unprecedented, unconstitutional and anti-democratic abuse of power”.Labour said it was talking to other opposition groups about a possible rapid vote of no confidence against Boris Johnson once parliament returns in September, and the “rebel alliance” began mulling over new governments, emergency legislation, breaches of convention and court cases – while being unsure whether no deal can be averted.The Institute for Government also warned that a no-deal Brexit now appeared increasingly likely given the lack of time to secure a new agreement and of opportunities for MPs to block it.Downing Street has said it expected the cross-party alliance of rebels to precipitate the parliamentary battle on 9 September, a week after MPs return from their summer break, and did not foresee any move from the EU27 until after that.With the stage set for a historic clash between the executive and the legislature, a number of outcomes are possible. Johnson has a working majority of one and it is certainly feasible that enough Tory rebels would join opposition parties to ensure he loses a no-confidence motion. That would usher in a 14-day waiting period in which an alternative government could, in theory, be formed, but this would be unlikely to be headed by Jeremy Corbyn, who does not have sufficient cross-party support to enter No 10.There could, therefore, be some kind of “national unity” government, probably temporary, to delay Brexit until a new election or referendum – but the problem there is that it would need significant numbers of Labour and Tory MPs to break ranks, fast.Johnson might be able to force a no-deal Brexit by simply refusing to resign and letting the clock tick down, but the political pressure would be huge, and some have speculated that the Queen could be called on to, in effect, sack him.To thwart the opposition, Johnson could call a post-confidence vote election himself and decide on a polling day that falls after 31 October. That might contravene the convention of “purdah” (civil servants are not supposed to push through major policy changes during an election period), but no one is really sure.Finally, MPs could seizing control of the Commons order paper to try to delay Brexit or call a referendum. But this can only happen if there is meaningful government business on Brexit for MPs to amend, and with no deal seemingly the government’s intended course, there might not be any.For those with an interest in crystal-ball gazing, some wildly different scenarios are sketched here by assorted figures from the worlds of politics, arts and science.Britons have spent £4bn stockpiling goods in case of no-deal Brexit.Caroline Lucas calls for an emergency female cabinet to block no-deal Brexit.Lord Heseltine: imposing no-deal Brexit an “intolerable” attack on democracy.Is Scotland finally set to bid farewell to the union?Swinson’s Lib Dems target Raab’s seat as Tory moderates flee no-deal Brexit.Brexit enforcer Cummings’ farm took €235,000 in EU handouts.With Britain on the brink of recession, “doomsters” may be proved right.UK car industry in brace position before Brexit deadline.UK to ease visa restrictions on top scientists post-Brexit.Corbyn should tell Queen “We’re taking over” if Johnson loses confidence vote.House prices fall unexpectedly as pre-Brexit caution bites.US will be “on doorstep” ready to sign UK trade deal after Brexit, says Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state.Pause competition law to avoid food shortages, say manufacturers.No deal would harm UK security, senior officer warns.Rolls-Royce says it has spent £100m preparing for no-deal Brexit.UK too desperate to secure US trade deal, says Clinton’s treasury secretary.In the Observer, Andrew Rawnsley says Johnson’s plot to subvert democracy is more dangerous than Brexit itself, and Conservative MPs have to stop it:All possible solutions depend on there being sufficient Conservative MPs capable of remembering that Britain’s democratic fabric relies not so much on laws as assumptions that people will behave properly … If Britain crashes out of the EU in the middle of an election campaign deliberately delayed by a prime minister with no mandate, it won’t just be the constitution that will be plunged into the darkest crisis of our modern history.A former cabinet minister goes viral:Good to get away for a few days.

advisers until  october further increasing already fevered speculation about the likelihood of a snap election in the aftermath of a no deal brexit meanwhile fears that the uk could be heading for its first recession in a decade were stoked by grim official figures showing that the economy had contracted in the second quarter and parliamentary resistance to the johnson cummings plan stiffened a cross party group of mps began working on a plan to thwart a no deal brexit on  october by forcing parliament to sit through the autumn recess while jeremy corbyn wrote to the cabinet secretary saying a no deal brexit during an election campaign would be an unprecedented unconstitutional and anti democratic abuse of power labour said it was talking to other opposition groups about a possible rapid vote of no confidence against boris johnson once parliament returns in september and the rebel alliance began mulling over new governments emergency legislation breaches of convention and court cases while being unsure whether no deal can be averted the institute for government also warned that a no deal brexit now appeared increasingly likely given the lack of time to secure a new agreement and of opportunities for mps to block it downing street has said it expected the cross party alliance of rebels to precipitate the parliamentary battle on  september a week after mps return from their summer break and did not foresee any move from the eu until after that with the stage set for a historic clash between the executive and the legislature a number of outcomes are possible johnson has a working majority of one and it is certainly feasible that enough tory rebels would join opposition parties to ensure he loses a no confidence motion that would usher in a  day waiting period in which an alternative government could in theory be formed but this would be unlikely to be headed by jeremy corbyn who does not have sufficient cross party support to enter no  there could therefore be some kind of national unity government probably temporary to delay brexit until a new election or referendum but the problem there is that it would need significant numbers of labour and tory mps to break ranks fast johnson might be able to force a no deal brexit by simply refusing to resign and letting the clock tick down but the political pressure would be huge and some have speculated that the queen could be called on to in effect sack him to thwart the opposition johnson could call a post confidence vote election himself and decide on a polling day that falls after  october that might contravene the convention of purdah civil servants are not supposed to push through major policy changes during an election period but no one is really sure finally mps could seizing control of the commons order

7902,"Media obsession with powerful advisers is not new. The influence of Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson was the stuff of hysteria in the Tony Blair years. Bernard Ingham and Marcia Williams were accused of having undue power during the eras of Margaret Thatcher and Harold Wilson. Right back to the original éminence grise in 17th century France, Père Joseph, and probably beyond, the mystique of the all-seeing adviser behind the throne has been a constant theme.But how well grounded is this in reality? What we do know is that those who work in the shadows are catnip to journalists who know less than they pretend about the workings of government. This is especially true in an embittered political era with a taste for conspiracy theories that seem to offer partisan observers simple explanations of complicated events. Sometimes the credulity can be abject.All of this has suddenly come together in Dominic Cummings, the new Downing Street prince of darkness, whose reputation for malign mastery has quickly vaulted to levels unmatched even by Campbell and Mandelson. Last week Cummings reportedly told his team that parliament could not oust Boris Johnson before the 31 October Brexit deadline even if he lost a vote of no confidence. On Wednesday Sir Malcolm Rifkind warned that Johnson could lose his head if he did a Charles I and defied the constitution in that way.When advisers become the story, as Cummings did this week, they should watch their backs as well as their heads. This sort of thing breeds resentment. Cummings already risks appearing – and being – the over-mighty subject of what is anyway a precarious and sectarian government. Something similar ended Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill’s tenure under Theresa May. Over the next few weeks the narrative of Cummings the magician will be tested to destruction. The destruction will either be ours or his, and possibly both.Dominic Cummings, the son of an oil rig project manager and a special needs teacher, was born in Durham in 1971. He attended a state primary school followed by the fee-paying Durham school and, in 1994, Oxford University, where he studied ancient and modern history. After three years living in Russia, where he attempted to set up an airline connecting Samara in the south with Vienna, the then 28-year-old became campaign director of Business for Sterling, which worked to prevent Britain from joining the euro.Although he has never, as far as anyone knows, been a member of a political party, Cummings was headhunted to be director of strategy for the then Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2002.While he was seen as a “young, thrusting moderniser”, Cummings quickly offended party traditionalists. He quit the job after only eight months, describing Duncan Smith as incompetent.Following the 2010 general election, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, appointed Cummings as his chief of staff. Many in Whitehall found Cummings as difficult as he found them. In 2013, civil servants in the Department for Education complained to the Independent of an “us-and-them, aggressive, intimidating culture” created by Cummings and Gove.He never hid his disdain for the workings of Whitehall and has derided Westminster figures in eye-catching media interviews and published rambling blogposts that are obsessed over by Westminster insiders. He described prime minister David Cameron as “a sphinx without a riddle”, and former Brexit minister David Davis as “thick as mince, lazy as a toad, and vain as Narcissus”.In 2015, Cummings and the political strategist Matthew Elliott founded Vote Leave, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official EU referendum leave campaign in April of the following year.Since the EU referendum, its tactics have been the subject of a series of high-profile scandals. Vote Leave’s use of data analytics has been scrutinised after the Observer reported that the data-mining company Cambridge Analytica had links to the Canadian digital firm AggregateIQ, on which Vote Leave spent 40% of its campaign budget.In July 2018, the Electoral Commission announced Vote Leave had been found guilty of breaking electoral law by overspending, following testimony from whistleblowers. The group was fined £61,000 and referred to the police. Cummings has used his blog to furiously defend himself and the Vote Leave campaign. In March 2019, he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear at a committee of MPs investigating fake news.Frances PerraudinYet it would be as much of a mistake to dismiss Cummings as to exaggerate his mastery. He has certainly brought two weeks of focus to the Johnson government by making the Halloween deadline a non-negotiable centrepiece. He has changed the political conversation from Brexit or people’s vote to deal or no deal. Depending on events in the early autumn, he is clearly gearing up for a possible general election shortly afterwards.But Cummings does not control events. He is not Prospero, able to conjure up a tempest that delivers his enemies into his hands. He is having a good run, but he is helped by the most irresponsible parliamentary summer recess of modern times. Even now MPs should be aiming to get back to Westminster and hold the government to account before the planned return on 3 September. They should scrap this year’s party conferences too.Cummings is also only one player. The idea that he pulls all the strings is lazy and wrong. The Brexit outcome depends on a tangled web of interests and influences beyond his control. These include everything from the role of the Queen to the hoarding of toilet rolls. In particular, it depends on events in the real economy, in parliament, in the courts, in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the Irish Republic, in the EU and in Johnson’s own head.Those who take a Cummings-fixated view of the options find it is easier to forget this. They say the government’s aim is to crash out with no deal on 31 October and nothing will stand in the way. But that is not quite what Johnson and some of his ministers say. They say, still, that a deal is one possibility, perhaps a remote one, and that the UK government is even now looking for a deal with the EU in the next 12 weeks.This is often dismissed as a mere smokescreen because the deal Johnson wants is not on offer from the EU. But Johnson’s specific demand, though difficult for the EU to concede, is also very particular. He does not want to reopen every bit of the withdrawal agreement. He wants the Irish backstop removed from it. The EU says the backstop – a sensible guarantee that is supported on both sides of the Irish border – is a non-negotiable part of the withdrawal agreement. On the face of it, therefore, there is no possibility of a new deal.Yet step back from this confrontation a moment if you can. Listen to the talk about talks this week. In London, Downing Street says it wants to negotiate. In Brussels, the commission says it is open to “clarification”. In Dublin, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says: “Our position is that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is closed but there is always room for talks and negotiations.” In Belfast, if the Sunday Times is right, the DUP – yes, the DUP – says it is prepared to consider a time-limited backstop.Think too about the economic and political pressures bearing in again on all the protagonists. In Britain the pound is sliding, the food industry is worrying and, according to the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, business faces an “instantaneous shock” and an early 2020 recession. But while Britain will suffer most from no deal – and heavily Tory and Brexit-supporting regions in England will suffer most of all – others will also suffer. A detailed survey in March by the Bertelsmann Foundation concluded that Ireland in particular will be very hard hit, as will northern France, Belgium and parts of the Netherlands.This is not to say that there will therefore be a rephrased deal to avert these and other bad consequences. Varadkar in particular is facing an election and has less room for manoeuvre as a result. Nor is it to say that the UK parliament can be relied on to find a way of stopping no deal or that the Tory party would fall into line in sufficient numbers if a deal were on offer.It is nevertheless possible that time-limiting the backstop in some way – five years is mentioned in some circles – and agreeing to negotiate the issues in the political declaration in good faith over an agreed timetable might, just might, make a difference. It would mean Britain leaving the EU. Johnson could claim a victory. But it could spare a lot of people, businesses, countries including Britain, and even Johnson himself, some real pain in the process. That deal might just be doable even now – whatever Cummings may say.• Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",Deal or no deal?

7953,"The stated intent of Boris Johnson’s government to ensure Brexit happens on 31 October, combined with a majority of MPs seemingly set on preventing a no-deal departure, sets the stage for a potential executive versus legislature struggle unparalleled in recent political history. How might such a constitutional crisis pan out?They can call one, and Labour has hinted strongly it will do so after the Commons returns in early September. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011, the opposition can table a motion saying: “This house has no confidence in HM government.” Last week’s Brecon and Radnorshire byelection reduced Johnson’s working majority to one, and it is perfectly feasible that a dozen or more Conservative MPs could join opposition parties to vote against him if the only other option were no deal.Unlike under the pre-2011 system, losing a vote of no confidence does not automatically herald a likely general election straight away. Instead, the law introduces a 14-day window in which the incumbent prime minister can try to prove they still command the support of the Commons, or else a new majority government can emerge. If neither happens, there is an election.Possibly, though there are many political barriers. It seems unlikely under Labour led by Jeremy Corbyn, as there does not seem to be sufficient cross-party support for him to enter No 10. One mooted possibility would be for some form of “national unity” government to take power, perhaps temporarily, to delay Brexit before an election or a new EU referendum, led by a consensual backbencher. However, this would need significant numbers of Labour and Tory MPs to break ranks and join MPs from other parties, all within a very brief window.The answer here is somewhere between “yes and no” and “who knows?” As several experts and observers have noted, the law does not make it explicit that a prime minister must resign if they lose a no-confidence vote, meaning Johnson could theoretically sit out the 14-day period before calling an election, by which point 31 October would be almost upon us.However, as others point out, the political pressure on him to go would be huge, and given an election would be imminent, effectively squatting in Downing Street to get your way would hardly be the best image for the electorate.Ultimately, prime ministers serve at the request of the monarch, and some have speculated that if a new, unity government was shown to be ready, and to command a Commons majority, the Queen could dismiss Johnson and invite a new prime minister to form a government. It is safe to say Buckingham Palace would very much not enjoy being put in such a position.Under the law, the date of the election following a no-confidence vote is a matter for the incumbent prime minister, and given the timetable – parliament returns from recess just over eight weeks before Brexit – Johnson could conceivably decide on a post-31 October polling day.Some no-deal objectors argue that under the convention of “purdah”, the election period during which civil servants are not supposed to push through any major policy changes, no major Brexit decisions could be taken. However, Johnson could argue that a no-deal departure on 31 October is already the legal default, and so is not a policy change.Either way, it would be hugely messy and no fun at all for senior civil servants, not least how to communicate no-deal preparations to the public amid purdah, when politically sensitive government messaging is meant to stop.In theory, yes – and this did happen in March, when MPs hijacked a government motion on the next steps for Brexit, passing an amendment tabled by the Tory grandee Oliver Letwin to hold indicative votes on a departure plan. It is possible that backbenchers could again circumvent the executive and order Johnson to seek a delay to Brexit, make arrangements for a referendum, or even – and this seems unlikely – revoke the whole process.However, this can only happen if there is meaningful government business on Brexit for MPs to amend, and with no deal seeming the government’s intended course, there might not be any. While there are a series of bills before parliament on post-Brexit arrangements for areas such as fisheries, agriculture and immigration, Downing Street has said it does not believe these need to be passed before 31 October. Another route could be artificially creating parliamentary time for, say, a private member’s bill, but again, this is not an easy process.",The fight over no-deal Brexit: how might the crisis pan out?,2019-08-06/15:23:50,the stated intent of boris johnson s government to ensure brexit happens on  october combined with a majority of mps seemingly set on preventing a no deal departure sets the stage for a potential executive versus legislature struggle unparalleled in recent political history how might such a constitutional crisis pan out they can call one and labour has hinted strongly it will do so after the commons returns in early september under the fixed term parliaments act of  the opposition can table a motion saying this house has no confidence in hm government last week s brecon and radnorshire byelection reduced johnson s working majority to one and it is perfectly feasible that a dozen or more conservative mps could join opposition parties to vote against him if the only other option were no deal unlike under the pre  system losing a vote of no confidence does not automatically herald a likely general election straight away instead the law introduces a  day window in which the incumbent prime minister can try to prove they still command the support of the commons or else a new majority government can emerge if neither happens there is an election possibly though there are many political barriers it seems unlikely under labour led by jeremy corbyn as there does not seem to be sufficient cross party support for him to enter no  one mooted possibility would be for some form of national unity government to take power perhaps temporarily to delay brexit before an election or a new eu referendum led by a consensual backbencher however this would need significant numbers of labour and tory mps to break ranks and join mps from other parties all within a very brief window the answer here is somewhere between yes and no and who knows as several experts and observers have noted the law does not make it explicit that a prime minister must resign if they lose a no confidence vote meaning johnson could theoretically sit out the  day period before calling an election by which point  october would be almost upon us however as others point out the political pressure on him to go would be huge and given an election would be imminent effectively squatting in downing street to get your way would hardly be the best image for the electorate ultimately prime ministers serve at the request of the monarch and some have speculated that if a new unity government was shown to be ready and to command a commons majority the queen could dismiss johnson and invite a new prime minister to form a government it is safe to say buckingham palace would very much not enjoy being put in such a position under the law the date of the election following a no confidence vote is a matter for the incumbent prime minister and given the timetable parliament returns from recess just over eight weeks before brexit johnson could conceivably decide on a post  october polling day some no deal objectors argue that under the convention of purdah the election period during which civil servants are not supposed to push through any major policy changes no major brexit decisions could be taken however johnson could argue that a no deal departure on  october is already the legal default and so is not a policy change either way it would be hugely messy and no fun at all for senior civil servants not least how to communicate no deal preparations to the public amid purdah when politically sensitive government messaging is meant to stop in theory yes and this did happen in march when mps hijacked a government motion on the next steps for brexit passing an amendment tabled by the tory grandee oliver letwin to hold indicative votes on a departure plan it is possible that backbenchers could again circumvent the executive and order johnson to seek a delay to brexit make arrangements for a referendum or even and this seems unlikely revoke the whole process however this can only happen if there is meaningful government business on brexit for mps to amend and with no deal seeming the government s intended course there might not be any while there are a series of bills before parliament on post brexit arrangements for areas such as fisheries agriculture and immigration downing street has said it does not believe these need to be passed before  october another route could be artificially creating parliamentary time for say a private member s bill but again this is not an easy process ,Brexit,0.233025506
7972,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Boris Johnson held firm on his “do-or-die” promise to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October, clashing with the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and sending his special EU envoy to Brussels to deliver the message that the UK will leave without a deal unless the bloc abolishes the Irish backstop.In comments that suggest he is preparing to blame the EU if the UK crashes out, Johnson said he was not aiming for a no-deal Brexit but there could be no further meaningful talks without a radical EU rethink on the backstop and the situation was “very much up to our friends and partners across the Channel”.However, the weakness of the prime minister’s position was underlined when the Liberal Democrats won the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, cutting his majority to one, and hardline Tory eurosceptic rebels said they would block any attempt to pass Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement again even if the backstop is removed.Johnson faces equally strong opposition from the left of his party, with moderate Tory supporters of a second referendum threatening to cross the House of Commons in order to foil Brexit – prompting urgent warnings that the new prime minister could rapidly lose control of parliament.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, did nothing to quell speculation about an autumn general election by announcing – in one of the most pro-Brexit areas of the country – that an “extra” £1.8bn would still be spent on NHS infrastructure and equipment even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Meanwhile, warnings of the consequences of leaving without a deal continued to come thick and fast: from Varadkar, who said we “should all be afraid” of it; the Bank of England, which said there was a one in three chance of a Brexit recession; and currency traders, who sent sterling to a new low.As evidence was published by the Lib Dems that companies that export only to the EU are largely unprepared for a no-deal Brexit, all English councils were instructed to appoint a “Brexit lead” to work with the government in preparing for the possibility that the UK will leave without an agreement.Brexit will take place on 31 October “whatever the circumstances”, No 10 insisted, refusing to say whether a parliamentary vote against no deal, a no-confidence vote in the prime minister or even a general election campaign would be considered sufficient reasons for it to change course.Brussels has certainly got the message: after the meeting between the prime minister’s chief envoy and senior EU figures, European diplomats were told Johnson has no intention whatsoever of renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and a no-deal Brexit is now his “central scenario”. It appears more and more likely that Johnson and his key adviser, Vote Leave mastermind Dominic Cummings, are indeed planning to take Britain out on 31 October regardless of what may happen in parliament – and perhaps in the middle of an election campaign.Many observers are now assuming No 10 is calculating that with Brexit delivered, the Tory party could unite the leave vote, obliterate Nigel Farage’s Brexit party altogether, and trounce the disheartened forces campaigning for a second referendum.Is that really the plan? Who knows. In the meantime, Jessica Elgot explains how the prime minister’s parliamentary majority could vanish, while Peter Walker and Seán Clarke examine the likely impact of a no-deal Brexit (spoiler: it’s not good).Surge in EU citizens unfairly refused access to universal credit.Low-income Britons ‘more vulnerable to recession than in 2008’.Edinburgh festival performers refuse sterling payments due to Brexit.UK less able to cope with hard Brexit than it was in spring, say officials.UK manufacturing ‘suffocating’ as output slips to seven-year low.BMW boss urges Boris Johnson to abandon no-deal Brexit.Labour would be ‘off our rockers’ not to back remain in poll, says Thornberry.We’ll block trade deal if Brexit imperils open Irish border, say US politicians.Brexit causes UK car industry investment to crash to ‘pitiful’ £90m.No-deal Brexit would endanger rural life, says Welsh leader.In the Guardian, Matthew d’Ancona works through how the next few months might pan out … It’s not pretty:When parliament returns on 3 September, the government will certainly face a vote of no confidence if it is still on course for a no-deal Brexit. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a vote of no confidence in the government would trigger a two-week scramble to form a new administration. If that quest failed – as it would – an election would be triggered. The Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 requires 25 working days between the dissolution of parliament and polling day. To squeeze in an election before Brexit day would require a vote of no confidence as soon as the Commons returned; the pre-emptive cancellation of the party conferences; a fortnight of pointless attempts to form an alternative government ending on, say, 17 September; and a snap election held after the minimum five-week campaign on Thursday, 24 October. Johnson wins, and Britain leaves a week later. How likely is it that this precise sequence will fall into place? How often does politics observe such neat patterns? It is more likely, indeed, that 31 October could fall in the middle of an election campaign – or even (since it is a Thursday) on polling day itself. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, believes there is no legal impediment to the UK leaving Europe even as rosette-bearing politicians crisscross the nation in battle buses. Already, the pro-remain campaigner Gina Miller is investigating the potential for a judicial review of this grotesque possibility. For how odd would it be for an election about Brexit, triggered by a confidence vote caused by Brexit, and framed by the prime minister’s readiness to embrace a no-deal Brexit, to be made both redundant and ridiculous in real time by Brexit happening anyway, in the thick of electoral battle? One might ask, more pithily: how the hell did we get here? Yet such are the times in which we live, and such are the worse ones towards which we are heading.Plunging pound - the Financial Times’ forex expert tells all:The Financial Times' @katie_martin_fx

8104,"In The Ultras, the brutal, brilliant novel by Eoin McNamee set during the Troubles, the protagonist (based on the real-life undercover British intelligence officer Robert Nairac) finds himself in the company of dangerous men like himself. The Ultras plot terrible events and create dark polities while forcing everyone else to live with their consequences. “Ultra meaning beyond,” wrote McNamee. “Ultra meaning extreme.”The so-called war cabinet formed by the new British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and whose course the maverick arch-Brexiteer Dominic Cummings now charts, of course bears no resemblance to the characters in the war of the Ultras imagined by McNamee. But the sheer velocity and ferocity of their opening salvoes about crashing out of the EU with no deal on October 31 unless the backstop – the insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland – is abolished, raise the kind of alarm that we in Ireland have not felt since the dark years of the Troubles.The political fear is that this new breed of “Brexit Ultras” (Johnson’s cabinet with Nigel Farage’s Brexit party snapping at its heels) could deliberately pursue a no-deal EU exit at the expense of a volatile Irish peace.The sabre-rattling and pre-emptive blame-shifting of course is intended to shore up political support in the UK ahead of a possible general election, but also to intimidate Ireland into abandoning the backstop while shaking the unity of the EU27. Europe, with its own demons to face, has its red lines too and will not sacrifice the single market or its external borders, or jeopardise the wider integrity of the European project. Ireland, and the fragile peace process that has been built over the past 20 years, falls between these two positions.And while it is still early days for the Johnson premiership, we have a deteriorated state of Anglo-Irish relations following his ascent to power. How real is the damaging rhetoric emanating from London and the anti-Irish tropes spewing from much of the British media? David Yelland, the former editor of the Sun, revealed that he had been shocked when “Tories of influence” told him privately that Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s taoiseach “isn’t bright” and “the Irish will blink”. “It seems, amazingly, that this is the actual policy of HMG under Johnson,” tweeted Yelland. “They are anti-Irish, arrogant, dangerous and wrong.”That relations between London and Dublin are now strained is beyond dispute, though officials in Dublin insist that much of the noise is to be expected and aimed at a domestic UK audience rather than Ireland or the EU.Still, following his appointment, it took almost a week for Johnson to place a phone call with Varadkar, who leads a confidence-and-supply coalition that – while shaky on a series of domestic issues – serves as a national government in all but name for the purposes of Brexit. When the phone call did proceed, both men adopted an uncompromising stance: Johnson insisting the removal of the backstop is a precondition for any deal, Varadkar adamant that the EU will not relent on the withdrawal agreement.Varadkar rightly reminded Johnson of the British government’s obligation – as a co-signatory of the Good Friday agreement – to exercise its power in respect of Northern Ireland with rigorous impartiality. Johnson’s government relies, for the time being, on the support in the Commons of the Democratic Unionist party to prop up its narrow majority. The difficult parliamentary arithmetic, combined with Johnson’s inflammatory rhetoric, represents a serious challenge to the UK’s obligation to act as an honest broker in respect of Northern Ireland – the majority of whose citizens voted, like their Scottish brethren, to stay in the EU.And although unionists are being comforted, for now, by Johnson, their confidence that a hard Brexit will not give birth to a united Ireland must also be fraying at the seams. This is not least because nearly two-thirds of the Tory party indicate in polling that they would rather sacrifice the union – and see Northern Ireland and Scotland leave it – than abandon Brexit.Johnson (just like his predecessors) has yet to offer any meaningful alternatives to the backstop, yet blindly insists, as a pre-condition to talks with Brussels, that it must be removed. Given such a hardline starting point, what compromises would a deal with Brussels before October 31 entail? The recent ITV interview with the foreign secretary Dominic Raab on the issue of what flexibility the UK government has shown to date does not augur well for what lies ahead.The high-handed, perhaps not entirely unexpected tone of the hard Brexiteers, including Johnson, has undoubtedly reawakened bad memories in Ireland. Nobody on the island is blind to the reality that in standing by the backstop in order to avoid a hard border, they could end up with one if the UK crashes out without a deal. Indeed, the Irish government has conceded, in its latest updated contingency action plan, that it will implement increased checks and procedures in the event of a no-deal Brexit. That means border infrastructure and checkpoints that, however they are named and wherever they are, will have social and economic consequences both foreseen and unforeseen.One of those consequences is the possibility of a united Ireland – a prospect that terrifies me if the process of getting there is not given the time and breadth it needs, and if that existential, constitutional question it is not curated with the utmost inclusiveness and sensitivity.Last week Varadkar stated the obvious when he told the MacGill summer school that a hard Brexit would force communities in Northern Ireland to consider the possibility of a united Ireland. They already are. What was once an entirely fringe aspiration for nationalists, and a dreaded fear for unionists – each side comforted by the thought that the conversation about unification was decades away – has become an urgent debate for all.Contrary to anti-Irish tropes that the backstop is a Trojan horse in order to secure a united Ireland, the truth is that both communities in Northern Ireland – as well as citizens across the island of Ireland – are fearful of what a botched, rushed conversation about unification might yield. That fear is that the birth of a united Ireland would be accompanied by violence and upheaval.Unification without the support of unionists, whose traditions and identity must be protected as part of any shared future, cannot be pursued as a zero-sum game. Otherwise we risk repeating history: the Troubles in reverse. Northern Ireland could not, in its current perilous state, survive either a hard Brexit or a united Ireland. Its communities are suspended in an in-between space, in which they have enjoyed 21 years without violence but have not yet progressed to a positive peace or meaningful integration – a process that takes time and effort to heal wounds.What many people in the UK forget or are indifferent to is the fact that, for all the successes of the Good Friday agreement – a vital edifice that allows us to identify as British, Irish or both – peace is not fully won.That is why all the trash talk is so damaging, and why we need to pull back from the rhetorical brink. That is what is lost in this war of the Ultras: that the price of political power could be the unforgiveable loss of peace.• Dearbhail McDonald is an Irish commentator and the author of Bust",Irish

8159,"Labour’s Emily Thornberry has said the party would be “off our bloody rockers” not to seize the chance to remain in the EU via a second referendum, in an interview which put her at odds with comments from Jeremy Corbyn over the weekend.Speaking in Australia, the shadow foreign secretary said all her meetings in the country had underlined how much better off the UK would be inside the EU.“People that I’ve spoken to here appreciate that, and I have to say practically all of them … have said if we get an opportunity to remain in the European Union, we should take it. Because if we don’t, we’re off our bloody rockers,” she said.On Sunday Corbyn said Labour would campaign for a second referendum and to remain in the EU if Johnson was proposing a no-deal Brexit but said the party would “reopen talks with the EU” about a Brexit deal if it won an election.Asked personally whether he would prefer to remain in the EU or to leave with a Labour-backed deal, Corbyn declined to make a choice. “Investment, jobs, trade and equality, both in or out of the EU. I want those things,” he said.“What we proposed was actually a very credible deal. A bespoke customs union with the EU and the trade arrangements would have achieved those things. It didn’t go through parliament, that was the problem.”Speaking to Sky News Australia’s Graham Richardson, Thornberry said a second referendum should apply to “any deal, or no deal, or whatever this government comes up with”.She added: “It should be put back to the British people so they can be asked: is this what you voted for? Because if you did, that’s fine. But we don’t think it is what you voted for.“I’m firmly of the view that Labour’s policy should be that whatever deal a government comes up with – no ifs, no buts, as Boris Johnson says – we should put it back to the people, we should have another referendum, and that Labour should campaign to remain.“When I’ve been talking to people here in Australia … what’s really come home to me is that one of the reasons for the increased success of the Australian economy … is that you increased your trade with your closest neighbours, and yet in Britain what we’re doing is walking away from our closest neighbours and our biggest trading allies.”This year Corbyn firmly committed the party to backing a referendum on no deal or a Tory Brexit deal, but went further after the EU elections, saying that if a future Labour government were to negotiate a Brexit deal, that would be put to a referendum too.The party’s current position is to back remain over no deal or any Tory-brokered deal, but Corbyn has left open the option of Labour backing leave in a referendum on a deal negotiated by a Labour government – or potentially remaining neutral.","We'd be ‘off our rockers’ not to back remain in poll, says Thornberry",2019-07-31/13:33:01,labour s emily thornberry has said the party would be off our bloody rockers not to seize the chance to remain in the eu via a second referendum in an interview which put her at odds with comments from jeremy corbyn over the weekend speaking in australia the shadow foreign secretary said all her meetings in the country had underlined how much better off the uk would be inside the eu people that i ve spoken to here appreciate that and i have to say practically all of them have said if we get an opportunity to remain in the european union we should take it because if we don t we re off our bloody rockers she said on sunday corbyn said labour would campaign for a second referendum and to remain in the eu if johnson was proposing a no deal brexit but said the party would reopen talks with the eu about a brexit deal if it won an election asked personally whether he would prefer to remain in the eu or to leave with a labour backed deal corbyn declined to make a choice investment jobs trade and equality both in or out of the eu i want those things he said what we proposed was actually a very credible deal a bespoke customs union with the eu and the trade arrangements would have achieved those things it didn t go through parliament that was the problem speaking to sky news australia s graham richardson thornberry said a second referendum should apply to any deal or no deal or whatever this government comes up with she added it should be put back to the british people so they can be asked is this what you voted for because if you did that s fine but we don t think it is what you voted for i m firmly of the view that labour s policy should be that whatever deal a government comes up with no ifs no buts as boris johnson says we should put it back to the people we should have another referendum and that labour should campaign to remain when i ve been talking to people here in australia what s really come home to me is that one of the reasons for the increased success of the australian economy is that you increased your trade with your closest neighbours and yet in britain what we re doing is walking away from our closest neighbours and our biggest trading allies this year corbyn firmly committed the party to backing a referendum on no deal or a tory brexit deal but went further after the eu elections saying that if a future labour government were to negotiate a brexit deal that would be put to a referendum too the party s current position is to back remain over no deal or any tory brokered deal but corbyn has left open the option of labour backing leave in a referendum on a deal negotiated by a labour government or potentially remaining neutral ,Brexit,0.367490262
8193,"Boris Johnson has declined to give specific details about how his government would help agriculture in the event of a no-deal Brexit, after farming groups said it would be catastrophic for the sheep and lamb industry.Before a trip to Wales on Tuesday, where he visited a chicken farm near Newport, the prime minister was urged to “stop playing Russian roulette” with farming and warned that leaving the EU without a deal could spark civil unrest.But Johnson dismissed those concerns, saying it was important for people to be confident about the government’s no-deal plans.During his farm visit, he declined twice to provide details on what sort of help farmers would get, beyond saying they had the support they needed and that the government would help them to find new markets if other ones became trickier to do business with. “We have interventions that are aimed to support them and their incomes,” he added.Johnson said: “As you know, Defra, the [agriculture] ministry, has done a huge amount already to prepare in advance to 29 March, and will do even more to prepare in the run-up to 31 October, when we come out.”Pressed on what help would be provided, he said: “The more you prepare, and the more confident you are about the measures you put in place, the less likely it is that there will be difficulties when it comes to 31 October.”Johnson reiterated his belief that a no-deal outcome was unlikely, and said it was up to the EU whether the UK left the bloc without a new withdrawal agreement: “It’s their call if they want us to do this.”He said the EU had to accept the removal of the Irish backstop – something Brussels has repeatedly said it would not do.“If they understand that then I think we’re going to be at the races,” said Johnson. “If they can’t compromise, if they really can’t do it, then clearly we have to get ready for a no-deal exit, and I think we’ll do it. I think the people of this country are full of resolve and purpose, and we will look after the farming sector.”On his visit to Wales, Johnson met Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister. A Welsh government spokesperson said the pair “had substantial discussions, but clearly there are fundamentally different views on Brexit”.Drakeford “repeatedly warned of the catastrophic impact Brexit would have on Wales and pressed the prime minister on what support would be available for Welsh industry and agricultural sectors” but “no details [were] given about new or alternative markets”.The first minister also urged Johnson to hold a second referendum “to test the views of the people”. Before the trip, Johnson was warned that 40% tariffs on meat exported to the EU could lead to the mass slaughter of sheep.The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more. Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. A complete clearout of May’s remain-minded ministers provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though.The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May’s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy – something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.  If Brexit wasn’t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn’t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn’t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the ‘Gaukward squad’ of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters – especially Tory members – will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider – during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May’s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.Critics might say this is Johnson’s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor – an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers – Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 – a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his adopting the acronym 'Dude' in his victory speech shows just how hard it is for him. Peter Walker Political correspondentHelen Roberts from the National Sheep Association in Wales said it would be “absolutely catastrophic” to leave with no deal and could lead to civil unrest among sheep farmers.“I’d want him to stop playing Russian roulette with the industry,” she said.Roberts said she did not want to see a mass slaughter for welfare reasons and that the government needed to get cold storage in place and talk about public procurement of lamb meat.Asked about civil unrest among farmers such as tractors being used to block roads, she said: “I think they will. It is time to stand up for ourselves ... I suspect there will be protests.”Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers Union, said there would be no market for 40% of the UK’s lamb meat in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“You would be in oversupply because you wouldn’t be able to get over the barrier of a tariff to Europe,” she said.She said a mass slaughter was the last thing the NFU wanted but to avoid that the government would need to look at forcing hospitals, schools and other public bodies to buy lamb meat.Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, agreed that farming was a winner from having access to EU markets but said there was potential for exports to new markets.Asked for his response to threats of civil unrest, he claimed UK farmers could export their meat to Japan rather than Europe.“I would say we are working to get a deal and the European market is important to us but there are markets around the world,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.He added that it was not clear how civil unrest would take place. “The context is that Wales has voted to leave the EU … we have an obligation to leave and of course we would much prefer to leave with a deal.”Last week research commissioned by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board and Quality Meat Scotland found that combined beef and sheep meat exports to the EU could decline by 92.5%, with the lamb export trade “almost completely wiped out”.In a no-deal scenario, the 37,000 carcasses a week that are usually sent to Europe would be stopped overnight under strict EU import rules that require de facto licensing for all farm exports.This has led to suggestions of a mass cull of animals as well as the need for state aid to support farmers, some of whom earn as little as £13,000 a year.",Johnson refuses to give details on

the national sheep association in wales said it would be absolutely catastrophic to leave with no deal and could lead to civil unrest among sheep farmers i d want him to stop playing russian roulette with the industry she said roberts said she did not want to see a mass slaughter for welfare reasons and that the government needed to get cold storage in place and talk about public procurement of lamb meat asked about civil unrest among farmers such as tractors being used to block roads she said i think they will it is time to stand up for ourselves i suspect there will be protests minette batters the president of the national farmers union said there would be no market for  of the uk s lamb meat in the event of a no deal brexit you would be in oversupply because you wouldn t be able to get over the barrier of a tariff to europe she said she said a mass slaughter was the last thing the nfu wanted but to avoid that the government would need to look at forcing hospitals schools and other public bodies to buy lamb meat alun cairns the welsh secretary agreed that farming was a winner from having access to eu markets but said there was potential for exports to new markets asked for his response to threats of civil unrest he claimed uk farmers could export their meat to japan rather than europe i would say we are working to get a deal and the european market is important to us but there are markets around the world he told bbc radio  s today programme he added that it was not clear how civil unrest would take place the context is that wales has voted to leave the eu we have an obligation to leave and of course we would much prefer to leave with a deal last week research commissioned by the agriculture and horticulture development board and quality meat scotland found that combined beef and sheep meat exports to the eu could decline by   with the lamb export trade almost completely wiped out in a no deal scenario the   carcasses a week that are usually sent to europe would be stopped overnight under strict eu import rules that require de facto licensing for all farm exports this has led to suggestions of a mass cull of animals as well as the need for state aid to support farmers some of whom earn as little as   a year ,Brexit,0.183913529
8198,"No-deal Brexit, crashing out, or a departure on WTO terms – call it what you will, it seems increasingly possible the UK could experience this on 31 October. How could it end up happening? And what would it mean?No deal is the default – without a withdrawal agreement in place it takes place automatically on 31 October. A new deal seems increasingly unlikely given that Boris Johnson and his ministers have demanded terms – scrapping the Irish backstop and an entirely new withdrawal deal – that have been repeatedly rejected by Brussels and would be hugely ambitious anyway given the 93-day deadline.It seems a majority of MPs still oppose a no-deal departure, as they did in March. It nonetheless remains unknown if the Commons can block Johnson if he is intent on such a Brexit, whether or not proroguing parliament is possible. MPs would need to create the circumstances for a binding vote and it is unclear how this might be done. It is worth noting here that some in Westminster see a government intent on no deal being blocked by parliament as Johnson’s preferred scenario – allowing him to call an election as the self-styled champion of Brexit.The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more. Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. A complete clearout of May’s remain-minded ministers provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though.The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May’s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy – something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.  If Brexit wasn’t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn’t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn’t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the ‘Gaukward squad’ of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters – especially Tory members – will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider – during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May’s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.Critics might say this is Johnson’s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor – an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers – Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 – a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his adopting the acronym 'Dude' in his victory speech shows just how hard it is for him. Peter Walker Political correspondentIt would simply mean that at 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period. This would drop the UK out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.To a great extent this is a leap in the dark, given the multiplicity of factors involved, but a number of sectors are deeply worried. With meat farming, there would be an immediate WTO 40% tariff on exports to the EU, which could instantly wipe out many farming businesses. Other UK firms that export to the EU would need to apply for customs, excise and VAT procedures, or they could not ship goods. Delays due to border checks, which many business groups warn could soon become very long, would have knock-on effects for firms reliant on a constant stream of supplies. For individuals, there are concerns about supplies of medicines, and the potential that travellers to the EU might need to go through extra checks. Essentially, for both businesses and individuals, the potential list of impact is very long and cannot be completely predicted.The government began preparing for possible no deal ahead of the original Brexit deadline in March, passing legislation to cover areas such as nuclear material, money laundering and road haulage, and moving thousands of civil servants to make no-deal plans. While some warn that the government is still less prepared for an October no deal, planning has been stepped up under Johnson, with Michael Gove handed a cross-government cabinet role to lead on this, complete with a select cabinet sub-committee. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has promised extra funds in the event of no deal and could put together an autumn budget intended to rejuvenate the economy. The government is also reportedly spending up to £100m on an advertising campaign to let businesses and people know how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.It would involve checks of some form, whatever the UK government’s insistence that it will not impose any infrastructure. As the Irish government has pointed out repeatedly, Ireland cannot remain a part of the EU’s single market and allow the unmonitored flow of goods across what will then become a customs, standards and regulation border. While there is an understandable desire to avoid infrastructure on the frontier – which has so many crossing points it is virtually impossible to completely police anyway – some new system of checks would come into place.This is a question which the Johnson government has, as yet, not answered, particularly in the context of the many tax cuts and spending plans so far unveiled. Much of this has been based on the idea of using some or all of the £26bn or so of “fiscal headroom” – extra borrowing that would be permitted within current limits – to pay for this. However, Treasury forecasts say this money would evaporate in the economic hit of no deal. On the campaign trail Johnson said the government could instead use the £39bn divorce settlement with the EU. However, this is not a credible plan, as the sum covers a series of already-agreed UK commitments paid over a number of years. Some of the money could not be clawed back, and to renege on other payments would severely damage the UK’s financial credibility.No. One of the biggest appeals about a no-deal Brexit for voters who support it is the idea of “getting it over with”, absorbing whatever chaos takes place and moving on to other priorities. But this is a fantasy. The UK could not trade perpetually on WTO terms and would need to make a permanent trade deal with the EU – involving just the same issues as before, such as a divorce payment, and arrangements for the Irish border. The main difference is that this would all need to happen as quickly as possible, without the buffer of a transition period running to the end of 2020.",No-deal Brexit: how likely is it and what would

8216,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Boris Johnson became Britain’s new prime minister and immediately promised to negotiate a better departure agreement with the EU – while ramping up preparations for a no deal and delivering Brexit come what may on 31 October.Johnson packed his cabinet with loyal leavers and rightwing free marketeers headed by Sajid Javid at the Treasury and Priti Patel and Dominic Raab at the Home and Foreign Offices, and made Vote Leave mastermind Dominic Cummings a key adviser.In the Commons, the new prime minister pledged again to ditch the “undemocratic” Irish backstop and guarantee the rights of EU nationals in the UK, promising that post-Brexit the UK would have “the greatest and most prosperous economy in Europe” by 2050.The EU was quick to reject the UK’s new conditions: Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, said UK proposals must be compatible with the withdrawal agreement, while the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, described Johnson’s demand to remove the backstop as unacceptable.France and Ireland expressed alarm. Amélie de Montchalin, France’s European affairs secretary, repeated that the current withdrawal agreement was the the only way for the UK to leave the EU “in an orderly fashion”, and Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said Johnson was setting the UK “on a collision course with the EU”.But the prime minister doubled down, insisting no face-to-face talks with the EU were planned and there would be none until leaders agreed to drop the backstop, which he described in a phone call on Friday with Angela Merkel as “the only solution”.Michael Gove made clear the government was now “operating on an assumption” of no deal and several other ministers said Johnson was “turbo-charging” preparations to leave the EU without a deal if the EU refuses to drop the backstop.Dominic Raab said it would be the fault of a “stubborn” EU if the UK were to crash out without a deal and suggested – contrary to the view of most experts – that Britain would actually be better placed to negotiate a “good deal” afterwards.It won’t be plain sailing. The Institute for Government warned that the mammoth scale of the economic and bureaucratic emergency that would follow a no-deal Brexit would crush Johnson’s ambitious domestic agenda.And Johnson may not even get that far: the former Tory chancellor, Philip Hammond, confirmed he had held private talks with Labour’s Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, to plot cross-party moves aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit.The burning Brexit question is now this: government ministers may be talking tough, but do they really mean it – or is it all a lot of noise aimed at shoring up Conservative support for an imminent general election?Many observers think Johnson’s plan is to go to the country after demanding first what he knows Brussels cannot give (a backstop-free withdrawal agreement) and, second, what he knows parliament will not countenance (a no-deal Brexit).The prime minister, this theory runs, will then be able to portray himself, faced with the intransigence of a bullying EU and the cowardice of a remainer parliament, as the only true deliverer of Brexit and champion of “the will of the people”.We have no means of knowing, obviously, whether this is the case. But political scientist Rob Ford has an good piece here on the risks and opportunities for Johnson of trying to change the arithmetic in the Commons by means of an early election.Of course, Johnson could actually be serious about being willing, as Raab said, to “give the country some finality” by taking it out of the EU without a deal – with the dramatic consequences almost all experts believe that would entail.Pound drops to lowest level in two years amid no-deal Brexit rhetoricUK employment rate resilient despite Brexit uncertaintyBrexit could spell end of Ellesmere Port plant, says Vauxhall ownerUK aerospace industry steps up no-deal Brexit plan to switch regulatorI won’t support no-deal Brexit, says defiant Ruth DavidsonSacked minister urges Boris Johnson to dial down Brexit rhetoricNo plans for new laws to safeguard rights of EU citizens, says No 10We have been forgotten by Boris Johnson, say Britons in EuropeIn the Guardian, Matthew d’Ancona says the Vote Leave gang now running Britain do not want to govern but to win:Vote Leave was a campaign, not a party. Its business was direct democracy, not the representative variety. No wonder that some senior ministers are so excited to discover that – technically, at least – the UK could still leave the EU on 31 October, even if the country were then in the thick of an election campaign forced by a vote of no confidence. This is where a country ends up when it is governed by a caucus with a single, overriding objective. Johnson’s strategy, for all its initial brio and swagger, leads nowhere other than a zone of anger, division and dangerous disillusionment. To which his allies would doubtless say: so what? You heard the man – by any means necessary.And John Harris says Johnson is channelling a punk ethos to force through Brexit, and it could work:Punk spirit, cavalier style and wilful provocation will all inform the manner in which Johnson and his allies frame their greatest challenge of all: how on earth to deal with the very real crisis of Brexit and honour the Halloween deadline. And they look set to play a crucial role in gaining consent from those who have most to lose from crashing out of the EU. Faced with a set of impossible challenges, Johnson will present himself as the flamboyant, verbose, rule-breaking Englishman versus the washed-out logicians of the EU machine. Whether this approach could survive the sudden appearance of expensive food, empty shelves and queues of lorries is an interesting question. But in the midst of all that talk about a quickfire election and given deep-rooted English cultural traits and the strange, hallucinatory times in which we live, I would not underestimate his

8227,"The pound has slumped to a 28-month low as investors reacted with alarm to the escalation of no-deal rhetoric by Boris Johnson’s government.Sterling dropped below $1.23 against the US dollar and fell sharply against the euro to below €1.10 on the international currency markets on Monday, as cabinet ministers began meetings to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.But while the pound suffered, there was confusion from Johnson’s government about whether a no-deal Brexit is the main working assumption. The prime minister himself insisted there was an “assumption that we can get a new deal” and that he wanted to reach out to European leaders.However, his deputy official spokeswoman reinforced the position of Michael Gove, the cabinet lead for no-deal preparations, that “we must assume that there will be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October” unless EU leaders agree to reopen talks on the withdrawal agreement. The spokeswoman also made clear Johnson would not be meeting EU leaders until they agree to make a new deal that does not involve the Irish backstop.As the pound lurched downwards on Monday, an array of leading business groups lined up to voice exasperation that a lack of information from the government was hampering preparations for no deal.Echoing a warning from the Confederation of British Industry at the weekend Britain is ill-equipped for a disorderly EU departure, lobby groups representing firms employing millions of people across the UK sounded the alarm.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the lack of preparedness among its members was “frightening”, while the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said industry’s questions about how to prepare had “gone unanswered”. The Institute of Directors (IoD) said guidance from government had been partial and was yet to be properly road tested.The pound fell by more than 1.3% against the US currency to trade at about $1.2216, its lowest point since March 2017, extending a slide under way over recent months as the chance of the UK crashing out of the EU at the end of October mounts. The pound was down by a similar amount against the single currency at €1.0965.Analysts said comments from senior figures in Johnson’s cabinet had rocked the City, including a suggestion from Dominic Raab on Monday morning that the UK would be in a better place to negotiate a good deal with the EU after no-deal Brexit.The foreign secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the EU’s “stubborn” behaviour would be responsible if the UK left without an agreement with Brussels at the end of October.Petr Krpata of the City bank ING said: “The market [is] awaking to the reality of a new UK government, its rather combative stance on the current EU-UK Brexit deal, and its open remarks on the rising probability of a no-deal Brexit.”Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at financial trading platform IG, said: “With two months until the October deadline, there is reason to believe that the pound has plenty more downside to come.”Over the weekend, several key figures in Johnson’s government said the prime minister was “turbo-charging” preparations for no deal. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is expected to ramp up spending on no-deal readiness by about £1bn this week and the government is preparing to spend around £100m on a public information campaign for citizens and businesses using broadcast media and billboards.Hitting holidaymakers in the pocket as they head abroad during the school holidays, the pound has sunk by more than 10 cents against the dollar from a peak in excess of $1.33 in March. Against the euro it has fallen by more than 7 cents from a high of €1.17 recorded in May.The BCC, which represents 75,000 businesses employing 6 million people, called on the government to up the ante on no-deal preparations.“The 31 October deadline is fast approaching and businesses are being told to prepare for no deal, but there are still significant areas where there is simply little basis on which to plan,” said Claire Walker, co-executive director of the BCC.“Business communities want the government to make every effort to avoid no deal, but at the same time, urgently need it to up the ante on its planning to enable firms to prepare for all scenarios.”The FSB urged the government to “put its money where its mouth is” by handing £3,000 “Brexit vouchers” to small firms that trade overseas, to help them pay for advice on navigating custom and tariffs.Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the IoD, also called for firms to be issued with Brexit vouchers and criticised the lack of detail from government.“We have long urged our members to make any preparations they can for no deal, but many smaller firms simply haven’t had the time or money to spend on getting ready for something that has not been, and still isn’t, government policy,” he said.Make UK, the trade body for manufacturers, said many firms had already spent money preparing for the original Brexit date in

below   against the us dollar and fell sharply against the euro to below   on the international currency markets on monday as cabinet ministers began meetings to prepare for a no deal brexit but while the pound suffered there was confusion from johnson s government about whether a no deal brexit is the main working assumption the prime minister himself insisted there was an assumption that we can get a new deal and that he wanted to reach out to european leaders however his deputy official spokeswoman reinforced the position of michael gove the cabinet lead for no deal preparations that we must assume that there will be a no deal brexit on  october unless eu leaders agree to reopen talks on the withdrawal agreement the spokeswoman also made clear johnson would not be meeting eu leaders until they agree to make a new deal that does not involve the irish backstop as the pound lurched downwards on monday an array of leading business groups lined up to voice exasperation that a lack of

8292,"Four days after becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson has yet to make a phone call to his Irish counterpart. Leo Varadkar appears to have been pushed back in the queue with no arrangements yet in place for the conventional call that takes place when new leaders assume office in Ireland and the UK.Johnson has already spoken to five leaders around the world including Donald Trump on Friday, who later revealed he talked about doing a trade deal “five times” the size of existing arrangements with the UK.Also on Friday, Johnson contacted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to discuss a Brexit transition and in his first two days of office he spoke to Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Claude Juncker.The lack of contact with the taoiseach will add to the existing strains in Anglo-Irish relations since Johnson assumed power, with new tensions over remarks on the risks to Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.Varadkar said on Friday evening that “more and more people in Northern Ireland will come to question the union” if the UK crashed out of the EU, putting the region, which voted to remain, into a new historical chapter with the rest of the island of Ireland.“People who you might describe as moderate nationalists, or moderate Catholics, who are more or less happy with the status quo, will look towards a united Ireland. And I think increasingly you see liberal Protestants and unionists who will start to ask where they feel more at home,” he said at a summer school in Donegal.“One of the things that ironically could really undermine the union of the UK is a hard Brexit, both for Northern Ireland and for Scotland, and that is a problem they are going to have to face.”Congratulations to @borisjohnson on his election as party leader. Look forward to an early engagement on #Brexit, Northern Ireland and bilateral relationsHis remarks earned a sharp rebuke from the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley Jr who said his intervention was “unhelpful and unnecessarily aggressive”.DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said the “hysterical and self-centred” response of the Irish government to the demands of the UK prime minister to have the backstop removed from any exit deal speaks volumes.“The megaphone reaction demonstrates that the blatant attempts by Leo Varadkar and co to use the Irish border as a means of undermining Britain’s referendum has backfired on them and they know it.“The Irish government walked the world stage and styled themselves as the victims of British aggression. ‘Poor little Ireland’ may have worked in the past but people are growing tired of the same old tune. The game is up.“They have overplayed their hand and they need to change course.”Varadkar also said he would need to meet Johnson to understand his “real red lines” on Brexit, and that Ireland had shown in the past that it could be flexible.Johnson has already spoken to other leaders in the UK including Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and Michelle O’Neill, the head of Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland.On Friday Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, described Johnson’s comments on Brexit as “unhelpful” and said he appeared to be putting the UK on a “collision course” with the EU.He made his remarks after what he described as a “useful” meeting with Julian Smith, the new Northern Ireland secretary, who went to Belfast for a series of meetings aimed at getting the Stormont assembly up and running again.Downing Street has been approached for comment.",Boris Johnson yet to make a phone call to Irish PM Leo Varadkar,2019-07-27/13:43:15,four days after becoming prime minister boris johnson has yet to make a phone call to his irish counterpart leo varadkar appears to have been pushed back in the queue with no arrangements yet in place for the conventional call that takes place when new leaders assume office in ireland and the uk johnson has already spoken to five leaders around the world including donald trump on friday who later revealed he talked about doing a trade deal five times the size of existing arrangements with the uk also on friday johnson contacted the canadian prime minister justin trudeau to discuss a brexit transition and in his first two days of office he spoke to angela merkel emmanuel macron and jean claude juncker the lack of contact with the taoiseach will add to the existing strains in anglo irish relations since johnson assumed power with new tensions over remarks on the risks to northern ireland s place in the united kingdom varadkar said on friday evening that more and more people in northern ireland will come to question the union if the uk crashed out of the eu putting the region which voted to remain into a new historical chapter with the rest of the island of ireland people who you might describe as moderate nationalists or moderate catholics who are more or less happy with the status quo will look towards a united ireland and i think increasingly you see liberal protestants and unionists who will start to ask where they feel more at home he said at a summer school in donegal one of the things that ironically could really undermine the union of the uk is a hard brexit both for northern ireland and for scotland and that is a problem they are going to have to face congratulations to borisjohnson on his election as party leader look forward to an early engagement on brexit northern ireland and bilateral relationshis remarks earned a sharp rebuke from the democratic unionist party dup mp ian paisley jr who said his intervention was unhelpful and unnecessarily aggressive dup brexit spokesman sammy wilson said the hysterical and self centred response of the irish government to the demands of the uk prime minister to have the backstop removed from any exit deal speaks volumes the megaphone reaction demonstrates that the blatant attempts by leo varadkar and co to use the irish border as a means of undermining britain s referendum has backfired on them and they know it the irish government walked the world stage and styled themselves as the victims of british aggression poor little ireland may have worked in the past but people are growing tired of the same old tune the game is up they have overplayed their hand and they need to change course varadkar also said he would need to meet johnson to understand his real red lines on brexit and that ireland had shown in the past that it could be flexible johnson has already spoken to other leaders in the uk including scotland s first minister nicola sturgeon the dup leader arlene foster and michelle o neill the head of sinn féin in northern ireland on friday ireland s deputy prime minister simon coveney described johnson s comments on brexit as unhelpful and said he appeared to be putting the uk on a collision course with the eu he made his remarks after what he described as a useful meeting with julian smith the new northern ireland secretary who went to belfast for a series of meetings aimed at getting the stormont assembly up and running again downing street has been approached for comment ,Brexit,0.257275522
8348,"The Irish government has expressed alarm at Boris Johnson’s approach to Brexit as tension begins to mount over the increased risk of no deal.Michael Creed, Ireland’s agriculture minister, said the new position of the British government, which involves demands for a new deal without the Irish border backstop within 98 days, was a concern.“The makeup of this government seems to be a mirror image of his [Johnson’s] own viewpoint substantially and obviously that would be of concern to us,” he told RTÉ radio.“What the government is concerned about now is the approach of new administration in the UK to the withdrawal agreement. We see that as the way to have a planned withdrawal arrangement and obviously what we are hearing from the government is quite alarming.”On Wednesday the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said a “whole new” Brexit deal was “not going to happen”.No details have yet emerged of Johnson’s alternative proposals for the Irish border but he distanced himself from speculation about a return to a Northern Ireland-only backstop, telling the House of Commons that no part of the UK would remain in the customs union or single market.At the same time he referred to “abundant facilitations already available” away from the border for checks that could seal a deal. This could be read as an attempt to cherry-pick elements of the backstop arrangements, which include proposals for limited checks in warehouses, on farms and at ports and airports to ensure the single market was protected.Officials and politicians on both sides of the border welcomed the appointment of the former chief whip Julian Smith as Northern Ireland secretary. Smith is expected to fly to Belfast on Friday for his first series of meetings. His in-tray includes keeping the DUP onside for Brexit, getting devolved government restored and ensuring the region’s businesses, police and communities are ready for no deal.It is understood the Democratic Unionist party is happy that a “heavyweight” and a man it is familiar with will be in charge after Karen Bradley, who survived several calls to resign over various gaffes during her tenure.Nigel Dodds, the head of the DUP in the Commons, called on Johnson to “strain every sinew to strengthen the union, get a deal to leave on the right terms and get Stormont up and running again”.The DUP’s arrangement with the Tories holds for the duration of the government but must be reviewed before every Queen’s speech, which has been delayed by the Tory leadership battle. The party is expected to stress the urgent need to get government going again in Northern Ireland.Last week analysis from Stormont’s department for the economy said a no-deal Brexit could put 40,000 jobs at risk in Northern Ireland.The Freight Transport Association (FTA) and other business interests including Retail Consortium of Northern Ireland will be seeking early meetings with Smith’s team to drive home the realities of the all-island economy.Seamus Leheny, head of the FTA in Northern Ireland, said: “We have members who cross the border to distributions centres outside Dublin with 45-minute windows. If there are any delays at the border and they lose the slot they go to back of the queue. We are not against Brexit or optimism.

And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Both the Lords and the Commons gave Boris Johnson, who has pledged to negotiate wholesale changes to the withdrawal agreement or leave the EU “deal or no deal” by 31 October (and refused to rule out proroguing parliament to do so), a stark reminder of the challenge his premiership will face.After the upper house voted to ensure parliament must sit in the weeks leading up to the Brexit deadline, MPs – including Conservative rebels – followed suit, blocking any attempt to suspend parliament in order to force through a no-deal Brexit.The presumed prime minister’s march into Downing Street on Wednesday has also been spoiled by a string of ministerial resignations, with Philip Hammond and David Gauke saying they would step down before then, and Alan Duncan quitting on Monday in an unsuccessful bid to test parliament’s confidence in Johnson.Dominic Grieve warned that former ministers would join those prepared to vote down a Johnson administration heading for no deal and Labour’s Keir Starmer is seeking a cross-party alliance to block any attempt to leave without an agreement.However, Labour is thought unlikely to table a no-confidence motion in the new prime minister immediately, mainly because it stands little chance of winning before Johnson has at least tried to renegotiate Theresa May’s deal with Brussels.The new prime minister is therefore likely just to make a statement setting out his summer Brexit plans – at which point parliament breaks until September. “We’ll give him a time-limited chance,” one minister said.Assorted senior figures including three former prime ministers, meanwhile, poured scorn on Johnson’s embrace of a no-deal Brexit and his insistence, in his Telegraph column, that Brexit was like landing on the moon – all that was needed to pull it off was a bit of “can-do spirit” and a “sense of mission”.As the Democratic Unionist party impressed on him the need to resolve the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop to keep its support, Johnson claimed – giving no evidence as to how – that technological solutions could be found to prevent a hard border in Ireland.To add to Johnson’s concerns, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that a no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into a recession that would shrink the economy by 2% and push unemployment above 5%.Amid reports in the British press of all sorts of possible concessions being lined up by the EU27, including a “no-deal Brexit extension” beyond 31 October, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, insisted a new British prime minister would not change the fundamentals and there was no chance of the EU ditching or watering down the Irish backstop.The EU said it had no off-the-shelf Brexit plan for the new prime minister, was not working on one and there was now a “worrying lack of time” to find a compromise. It would put nothing new on the table but remained open to reworking the political declaration on future relations, sources said.Bronwen Maddox of the Institute for Government said Johnson faced four major and critical tasks in his first week: pick his cabinet, replace the chief negotiator, Olly Robbins, restart no-deal preparations and devise a plan for winning parliamentary support.Jo Swinson elected new Lib Dem leader, pledges to fight BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take to London streets.Weary firms gear up to hit the Brexit pause button for a second time.Prices rise for British tourists as Brexit puts the pound in the shade.Pro-Brexit activist wins appeal against £20,000 electoral spending fine.Revenue chief who received death threats over Brexit steps down.Ursula von der Leyen: hard Brexit would be massive blow for both sides.£1.3m in bonuses paid to Brexit department civil servants.Pound could fall to parity with dollar on hard-Brexit concerns.Hammond “terrified” by Jacob Rees-Mogg claim of no-deal Brexit boost.London house prices fall at fastest rate in 10 years.Sharp rise in Britons making applications for Irish passports.Jonathan Freedland wonders in the Guardian whether a no-deal Brexit might not have a silver lining – but suspects not:Perhaps no deal is what it will take to cure the country of its Brexit fever. Maybe nothing less than a complete severance of all ties is the only way to snap ourselves out of this delirium. Until now, for example, the Brexiters have been able to cast every hitch and disappointment as the handiwork of wicked remainers bent on thwarting Britain’s destiny. If there’s been no stampede of unicorns towards the sunlit uplands, that’s because the faint-hearts and fifth columnists connived with Brussels to deny the British people their will. A no-deal exit would end that betrayal myth once and for all. Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg and the others would have got everything they wanted. They would be unable to cry treachery, because we would have left the EU the way they demanded we leave. They’d be unable to blame remainers or the judges or the BBC or the universities, because no one would have stood in their way. It will be their Brexit and they will have to own it … But how plausible is it to imagine that, even if Brexit is the total rupture Farage yearns for, he won’t still insist that the people were betrayed and that this Brexit was insufficiently pure? And expectations of a no-deal exit are so low, if Britons are not living in the streets wearing animal skins and foraging for weevils by Christmas, the Brexiters will declare it a triumph.Nothing is certain, as we well know.

8508,"A change in British prime minister will not shift the fundamental realities of Brexit, Ireland’s deputy PM has warned, saying there is no chance of the EU ditching or watering down the Irish backstop.Wholesale changes to Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement have been suggested by some as a way of avoiding a no-deal Brexit, but Coveney told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: “If the approach of the new British prime minister is that they’re going to tear up the withdrawal agreement, I think we’re in trouble. I think we’re all in trouble, quite frankly.“That’s like saying, ‘Either give me what I want or I’m going to burn the house down for everybody’.”A no-deal departure would not be the fault of the EU, Coveney said, but would be entirely down to UK political considerations. If it happened, he added, Ireland would need to impose some form of border checks with Northern Ireland to safeguard its position in the EU single market.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn divorce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Martin BelamHe said: “Just because there’s a change in personality as British prime minister doesn’t mean that the negotiation of the last three years and the solutions that were designed by the British government as much as by the EU aren’t still as relevant and important today as they were six or eight weeks ago.”While the Sunday Times has claimed Ireland and other EU nations could be willing to give way to a Johnson government to avoid no deal, Coveney said major changes to the backstop – the insurance policy to avoid a hard Irish border if no other solution can be found – such as adding a time limit, were simply impossible.“We’ve always said no to that,” he said. “There’s a context around this. You have to be able to answer the question, if asked, of what happens at the end of that time limit. And if you can’t answer that question then it’s not a backstop at all.”The backstop, Coveney said, was “about reassuring people in Northern Ireland that they are not going to go back to the friction and tensions of the past”.He said: “To ask Ireland to compromise on that core issue, when we spent two and a half years working with the British government and the EU to try and find a way to compromise on all sides to ensure that we don’t face that prospect, it is not a reasonable ask, because of a political challenge in Westminster, to move away from that position.”Coveney said he understood only too well what the consequences for Ireland and Northern Ireland would be of no deal, but said this would entirely be down to UK government choices.“It is not where we are now. If the House of Commons chooses to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, and if a new British prime minister chooses to take Britain in that direction, then it will happen. But this will be a British choice. Not an Irish choice, not an EU choice – this is a British choice,” he said.He said everyone wanted to avoid no deal, having worked for three years to do that. “I have done little else in politics apart from focus on the choice of the British people to leave the European Union and its impact on Ireland and the EU,” he added.“We want to try to resolve these issues, but we won’t do it on the basis of being told what must happen because that is the only thing that will pass in the House of Commons.“And international negotiation needs to involve compromise on both sides. We have a deal that has involved compromise on both sides, to facilitate, let’s not forget, British red lines throughout this process. And a new British prime minister doesn’t change that.”In the event of no deal there would be some sort of checks on goods away from the border, Coveney said, to protect Ireland’s place in the EU single market. He added: “What I mean is, we cannot allow an open back door into the EU single market through Northern Ireland. If we do then the Republic of Ireland would be taken out of the single market as well, and I can’t allow that.”","Change in No 10 will not alter Brexit reality, warns Irish deputy

would by default become a third country in terms of relations with the eu with no overarching post brexit plan in place and no transition period the uk would no longer be paying into the eu budget nor

the uk would trade with the eu on the default terms of the world trade organization wto including tariffs on agricultural goods the uk government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country this would lower the price of imports making it harder for british manufacturers to compete with foreign goods if the uk sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the eu under wto most favoured nation rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries wto rules only cover goods they do not apply to financial services a significant

8618,"Some unionists in Northern Ireland fear Zimbabwe-style land seizures by Irish nationalists if the region joins a united Ireland, according to a report that lays bare anxieties about any Brexit-fuelled breakup of the UK.Farmers and others with Protestant and unionist backgrounds worry that Catholic and nationalist neighbours would claim their land in a cultural, economic and political takeover by Dublin – “the mother of all fears”, the report found.Based on interviews with focus groups and unionist representatives, the report was published on Thursday. It was compiled by Mark Daly, a senator with Ireland’s main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, to inform Irish policymakers about the implications if Northern Ireland votes to join the Republic despite opposition from unionists, as permitted under the Good Friday agreement.“The reason for the report is to identify the fears and concerns,” Daly said. “Identity is a key one – will roads be renamed, will it become Bobby Sands international airport?”Daly has his own fear: that Ireland will stumble into unity unprepared, unleashing grave, long-term consequences.The senator James Wilson, who served with the British army in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, was commissioned to interview members of the Orange Order, a loyalist flute band and Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) veterans, among others.Some expressed anxiety about losing land that was originally owned or farmed by Catholics displaced more than a century ago.“There are real and genuine fears among the unionist community in Northern Ireland that the land would be taken from them, there would be retribution on members of the security forces and their community’s identity would be lost,” said the report, which runs to 55 pages, with another 200 pages of appendices.Violent land disputes during the partition of Ireland in 1921 and the targeting of land-owning UDR members during the Troubles created a real fear of farm takeovers similar to those seen in Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe, said Daly. “It’s not theoretical. Anytime somebody says that and it’s not addressed, the fear grows.”Other fears include loss of identity, nationalist triumphalism, retribution against former security force members, a return to violence, losing welfare and health care benefits, and rejoining the EU.“For those who cling to the binary, and there are many unionists who do, the fear is that their identity is denied,” wrote one contributor, Mike Nesbitt, a former leader of the Ulster Unionist party.Rev Kyle Paisley, the brother of the Democratic Unionist MP Ian Paisley Jnr, cited fear of swapping the NHS for the Republic’s uneven health care.An unnamed UDR veteran painted a grim scenario of a loyalist uprising overwhelming the Irish army and police. “They would have to raise a Catholic gendarmerie, like the B Specials, and then you will have civil war, way beyond the Troubles II and more like Bosnia.”There was also a strong resolve among some unionists to fight for their rights in the face of a united Ireland. “There is a lot of young loyalists out there who missed the war, champing at the bit for military glory. We need Northern Ireland to work. If it doesn’t, a united Ireland will certainly not work,” said one unionist.Others viewed the Brexit chaos as a lesson to be learned. They saw the prospect of a border poll in the near future – with 50% +1 meaning their exiting the UK and joining a united Ireland – as a corollary of Brexit, which “filled certain cohorts of that demographic with apprehension and loathing”, the report found.The report also stated that the Brexit referendum has demonstrated that a border poll “cannot be rushed or used for political gain” or jeopardise “the hard won peace we all enjoy on this island”.Norman Hamilton, the former moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said he felt those who were pushing for united Ireland “have little skill in, or interest in, uniting communities” which would be necessary for such a major constitutional change.He said he feared a referendum in the foreseeable future “not least because of what has been learned – or not learned – from the recent referendum in the UK”.Paisley said he believed unionists would reject a united Ireland not just on political or religious grounds but because of a lack of unity on the matter and the attraction of the NHS in Northern Ireland.A unionist public representative told the researchers “any talk or discussion on a united Ireland by unionism is seen by many as tantamount to negotiating surrender”.Demographic data shows Northern Ireland Catholics, who tend to be nationalists, will soon outnumber Protestants, who tend to be unionists. A majority – 56% – voted in the 2016 referendum to stay in the EU but Northern Ireland now faces a potentially ruinous exit, burnishing the appeal of a neighbour with EU membership, economic success

8695,"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt’s Brexit plan to axe the Irish border backstop from the withdrawal agreement will be rejected outright by the European Union, EU sources have said.Informed sources say it is doomed to failure and if the next prime minister goes to Brussels with such a proposal, he will be told in “no uncertain terms” that it amounts to a declaration of no deal.Brussels had already rebuffed such a plan when the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, who is part of Johnson’s campaign, met the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, last week.In what was seen as “spinning for a Boris plan”, Barclay told Barnier five times during the meeting that the backstop was dead. Sources say he told Barnier they wanted a series of mini-deals and alternative arrangements for the Irish border.He was told that was Brexit fantasy and a non-starter, and that the “mini-deals” outlined in EU contingency plans were temporary and covered only the “bare bones” such as aviation, mobile phone roaming and haulier driving licences. They did not include the major issues such as trade or the Irish border.The EU is watching developments in the UK very closely and has already prepared responses on a range of possibilities including a call for the EU to endorse the so-called “Brady amendment”, which was passed in the House of Commons in January. It called for the backstop, or the mechanism by which a hard border will be avoided on the island of Ireland in case there is no post-Brexit free trade agreement, to be scrapped.This will also be rejected.Johnson and Hunt have declared the Northern Ireland backstop “dead” and promised to throw it out of any deal they negotiate with the EU, in comments that significantly harden their Brexit positions.Variously described as an insurance policy or safety net, the backstop is a device in the withdrawal agreement intended to ensure that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements.It would mean that if there were no workable agreement on such matters, Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union and much of the single market, guaranteeing a friction-free border with the Republic. This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU’s customs union permanently if the UK & EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc. Joint interpretative instrument A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU’s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.Unilateral statement from the UK This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.Additional language in political declaration This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, it failed to persuade the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it ‘reduces the risk’ of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it.Boris Johnson declared the Northern Ireland backstop ‘dead’ during his leadership campaign, and promised to throw it out of any deal he renegotiated with the EU. The EU has repeatedly stated that it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement for renegotiation. Daniel Boffey, Martin Belam and Peter Walker While their words may be the source of alarm, the Irish fully expected this and see it as campaign spin.Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, said in a radio interview over the weekend that he would give whoever became prime minister “a fair hearing” but warned that the victor would be in for a “reality check” when he got the keys to Downing Street.“Politicians when they are in campaign mode, and both of those men are in campaign mode, tend to campaign in poetry, in simple terms and high-level messages.“When you get into office you have to govern in prose, and I imagine whoever is the new prime minister is going to face a very serious reality check when they sit down with their officials,” he told Pat Kenny on Newstalk.The Irish senator and Brexit spokesman Neale Richmond said on Tuesday the remarks did not mean Ireland would be budging on the backstop. “The backstop is a vital aspect of the withdrawal agreement, an aspect that was developed in light of the UK government’s own red lines.“While it is no one’s preferred destination, it gives all sides the vital insurance policy to allow a new relationship between the EU and the UK to be formulated. The withdrawal agreement is the only vehicle towards a managed Brexit. It won’t be reopened.”On Monday night, the Tory leadership rivals both ruled out trying to tweak the backstop, which critics say could trap the UK indefinitely in a customs union with the EU.The EU is watching carefully and is expecting that if Johnson, the frontrunner, is selected, he will make immediate plans to fly to Brussels and Dublin for talks.If he decides to make his first visit the US, this will “embolden” EU member states because it will send a clear signal that he deems the US more important than the EU, the UK’s biggest trading partner.There is an expectation that Johnson and his negotiators will come to Brussels in September with an early outline of his new Brexit plan. But EU sources warn it will have to be tested first in parliament because they will not waste time negotiating anything that does not have a mandate in the House of Commons.The new UK prime minister might seek a string of protocols on alternative arrangements that would guarantee the backstop would never be used.“That would mean an insurance policy that would never be used. There would be no point to that,” said an EU source.Varadkar said in a lengthy interview with Kenny that Ireland was prepared for no deal but he hoped it would not happen.“It will be incredibly severe on Northern Ireland because it will face tariffs … and will face huge difficulties, because a huge amount of trade from Northern Ireland goes through Dublin.“The impact on Northern Ireland will be more severe than anywhere in Europe. The impact on the UK and Ireland would be pretty severe too.

8764,"The government’s decision to send a second Royal Navy warship to the Gulf will intensify concerns that Britain is unintentionally sliding into armed conflict with Iran. The deployment of HMS Duncan, a Type 45 destroyer, will be seen in Tehran as a gratuitous escalation of an already tense regional situation. It may help improve security for the 15 or more British-owned oil tankers that traverse the Gulf each day – or it may worsen it. The move potentially turns the warships and the tankers into targets, should Donald Trump impetuously decide to start a war.Once again, Britain is being dragged along by international events, lacking an independent, well-considered policy, compromising its principles, and at the mercy of more powerful antagonists. This sense of drift, of a rudderless ship of state bobbing haplessly in hostile waters, is pervasive and alarming. To say it is the product of temporary uncertainty, caused by a change of prime minister, is to underestimate the problem. In this respect, Boris Johnson is both symbol and symptom of a deeper malaise.Britain is in the grip of a fundamental crisis of confidence that is negatively affecting its governance, its institutions and its place in the world, and it is a crisis that appears to be worsening. Historians may one day trace its roots into the distant past but for now, it is enough to say that this national haemorrhage of shared purpose and belief began in earnest in June 2016, when Britain voted to leave the EU. The subsequent controversy, and resulting impasse, have proved uniquely corrosive and damaging.John Sawers, a former MI6 chief and seasoned diplomat with no particular axe to grind, warned recently that Britain was experiencing “a political nervous breakdown” for which no remedy was in sight. He questioned the calibre of politicians, Conservative and Labour, who seek to lead the country amid great anxiety and division. Whoever next enters Downing Street, he said, would be launching into an immense gamble: “As we leave the European Union, we take a huge risk to our international standing [and] to the strength of the British economy.”Extreme nervousness among government officials, civil servants and diplomats that Britain, as presently run and organised, may not be equal to this challenge is everywhere apparent. One key indicator is virtual paralysis in parliament and Whitehall over both Brexit and non-Brexit matters; the current policy vacuum is simply staggering. Another indicator is collapsed rules of collective cabinet responsibility. Yet another is the reports, seeping out almost daily, that government departments are unprepared for Brexit, that civil servants are overwhelmed, and that no-deal chaos awaits on 31 October.Reports seep out that government departments are unprepared for Brexit, civil servants are overwhelmed, no-deal chaos awaitsThe recent torrent of unauthorised disclosures of confidential material speaks of a system close to breaking point. Last May saw an unprecedented breach at the National Security Council, relating to the Chinese company, Huawei. Last week’s indefensible leaking of critical views of Trump privately expressed by Kim Darroch, Britain’s ambassador to Washington, also reflects this wider internal governmental breakdown. Darroch’s understandable but regrettable resignation was yet another shock to the government’s central nervous system.The impact of this betrayal on Britain’s diplomats based overseas, and on civil servants generally, is potentially very serious. Who can now be trusted in a dangerous, treacherous and competitive world if your own side is ready to sell you down the river? What to do when politicians such as Johnson will not hesitate to throw you “under the bus”, as the Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan put it, if it helps further their personal ambitions?Johnson’s conduct in the Darroch affair, and his weaselly attempts to exculpate himself, is a disgrace.

fundamental crisis of confidence that is negatively affecting its governance its institutions and its place in the world and it is a crisis that appears to be worsening historians may one day trace

8916,"A no-deal Brexit is an “ugly prospect” that will oblige Ireland to impose customs checks on trade with Northern Ireland, the Irish government has warned.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, made a grim prognosis on Tuesday of the “dire” consequences if the UK crashes out of the EU.“A no-deal Brexit is an ugly prospect. It will put many businesses and many people under a great deal of strain,” he told a press conference in Dublin.The tánaiste was speaking after the Irish government released a 117-page report outlining the country’s contingency plans for no deal.“It will put political relationships on this island under a great deal of strain, in my view. It will make it more difficult for the institutions of the Good Friday agreement to function and it will be a fundamental disruptor to the all-island economy.”Coveney said that to protect the EU’s single market, Ireland would check trade between the republic and Northern Ireland. “We will need to take some action somewhere … but we will not put checks on the border, or close to it.”He said Dublin was working with the European commission to balance such checks with the need to avoid a hard border and protect the Good Friday agreement, but refused to say how this would be achieved. “There is no evil plan on a shelf somewhere.”After a special cabinet meeting, the Irish government released the report outlining “very damaging” consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the political process in Northern Ireland, adding that it “risks significantly undermining wider community relations and political stability … with potential related security concerns”.The report also reveals that additional gardaí have been deployed to border areas in recent months, and that more will be sent immediately in the event of no deal.But “there should be no illusion” over the impact of Brexit on the island, with 11 risks identified including the undermining of community relations and political stability in Northern Ireland.The report also put paid to Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt’s hopes that the EU will accept technology-based “alternative arrangements” for the Irish border.It says it has been working with the European commission on this issue this year but “no one has yet come up with any alternatives that meet the same objectives as the withdrawal agreement”.Report says since last year Irl has been working with EC on no deal. ""No one has yet come up with any alternatives that meet the same objectives as the Withdrawal Agreement."" pic.twitter.com/YE5OTLksTOThe report says the government’s assessment is that there is now “a significant risk of a no-deal on 31 October” and preparation for such an event is a priority.It warns of a potential £6bn cost to the Irish economy and an estimated increase in unemployment of 50,000-55,000.“Preventing the emergence of a hard border on the island of Ireland remains of the highest priority,” says the report, but despite preparations “without the withdrawal agreement and the backstop, there are no easy answers”.The biggest challenge will be how to continue cross-border trade involving animals and agricultural products.In a no-deal scenario, all food and animals from Northern Ireland will be treated as sourced from a third country and not eligible to enter the EU without checks on traceability and disease.As expected, the report does not say how these would be accommodated and says further talks with the European commission are needed. The report warns of “disruption in north-south trade and the all-island economy due to tariffs and the imposition of various regulatory requirements”, and to cooperation in areas such as energy, road and rail connectivity. The Irish government has been caught in a bind, refusing to discuss plans for the border in the event of no deal because that would risk legitimising a disorderly exit. At the same time, it is aware of its EU obligations to protect the single market from third-country goods.The report says at least 24 hours’ notice will have to be given for goods going from the UK into Ireland. About 400 additional customs staff have been recruited with 190 staff in the Department of Agriculture to conduct import controls.Séamus Nevin, the chief economist of Make UK, the British manufacturers’ association, said the plan to oblige UK traders to give 24 hours’ notice to Irish authorities was a “serious challenge to the viability of any Northern Irish manufacturer or farming business”.Given the nature of modern supply chains and just-in-time deliveries, “the Dublin government is playing serious hardball and calling Her Majesty’s government’s bluff”.","No-deal Brexit a

8936,"Jeremy Corbyn has sought to draw a line under Labour’s Brexit travails by announcing a “settled” policy of backing remain in any referendum called on a Conservative deal.The Labour leader has been under intense pressure to shift to an overtly anti-Brexit stance, but has insisted on consulting the party’s stakeholders in recent weeks, including the trade unions.In a statement emailed to party members on Tuesday, Corbyn made no reference to what stance Labour would take in the event of a general election in the near future, or whether Labour could enter such a contest saying it would still go ahead with leaving the European Union.But he made clear that if a referendum was called on the Brexit deal negotiated by the incoming Conservative prime minister – or on whether to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit – Labour would support remain.Corbyn wrote: “Whoever becomes the new prime minister should have the confidence to put their deal, or no deal, back to the people in a public vote. In those circumstances, I want to make it clear that Labour would campaign for remain against either no deal or a Tory deal that does not protect the economy and jobs.”The trade unions published a statement on Monday that suggested Labour should seek to negotiate its own, better Brexit deal and then put that to the people, but declined to specify how the party would campaign in the event of that happening.Corbyn acknowledged the issue of Brexit had “been divisive in our communities and sometimes in our party too”. He defended Labour’s position over the past three years, saying it had been right to respect the result of the 2016 referendum.“Labour set out a compromise plan to try to bring the country together based around a customs union, a strong single market relationship and protection of environmental regulations and rights at work. We continue to believe this is a sensible alternative that could bring the country together,” Corbyn said.With Labour under intense pressure from more overtly pro-remain parties, including the Liberal Democrats, the party had already shifted since the European elections towards urging the Conservatives to put their deal to a public vote. But Corbyn had previously stopped short of saying Labour would campaign for remain in the event of a referendum being called.In an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, he said there was no decision yet as to what Labour would argue for in a general election on Brexit. He said: “We will decide very quickly at the start of that campaign exactly what our position will be.”Pressed on whether Labour was now a party of leave or remain, Corbyn said: “We will give people the choice on this. That is something which is surely very important. We respect the result of the referendum. We’ve been through this whole long parliamentary process over the past three years and we’ve made it very clear we will do everything we can to take no deal off the table or stop a damaging deal of the sort Hunt and Johnson are proposing.”Corbyn believes the fact that both sides of the party have signed up to the new policy vindicates his approach of moving gradually, and only after extensive consultation.Labour also hopes that it can now set aside the Brexit row, and gain more of a hearing for other domestic policies.Differences in the shadow cabinet over Brexit policy have repeatedly been played out in public in recent months, with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, joining calls for his party to adopt a remain stance.The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, was dropped from deputising for Corbyn at prime minister’s questions after criticising the party’s position during TV coverage of the European election results. “We were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear,” she said.Corbyn’s deputy, Tom Watson, has publicly urged party members to make their disquiet about Labour’s position known by signing up to a remain “declaration”.But their fellow shadow cabinet members Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery have repeatedly expressed concerns about the idea of supporting remain in a referendum, fearing it will undermine Labour’s support in

9180,"The problem with assessing the intentions of a serial liar is that disbelief becomes second nature. So when Boris Johnson stated his Brexit plans in interviews last week and over the weekend it was largely overlooked. The media and public preferred to focus Johnson’s absurd claim that he enjoys arts and crafts of the vehicular variety. Less a dead cat than a dead kitten.What makes Johnson’s intentions even harder to assess is his absence of principles. He belongs to a vanishingly small group of Britons who believe in neither leave nor remain. It is not that he has changed his mind but that he has never much cared either way. For Johnson, Brexit was a passing bandwagon to the premiership, and he was prepared to climb aboard. It is testament to his political skill that he has hoodwinked the Brexit zealots into believing he is their man.So could he be Johnson the pretender, the man who seized the Brexit crown only to betray those who handed it to him?Johnson claimed that his “plan A” was to leave “with a standstill between the UK and the EU so we keep going with the existing arrangements until such time as we have completed our free trade agreement and we use that period to solve the questions of the Northern Irish border”. Rather than pausing the process inside the EU, it seems that Johnson might propose to park Britain just the other side of the line. 31 October would be a symbolic exit, legally out but practically in – Brexit in name only. It would be a dropkick of the can down the road.Can Johnson really believe it is possible to hoodwink the nation with a wheeze that leaves us in the EU but with no say?Such a plan could perhaps be described as the “backstop triple-plus” – that is, the customs union plus the single market, free movement and the full financial contribution. It would take the original 21-month transition negotiated by Theresa May and reformulate it to be “as short as possible, as long as necessary”. Doubtless the political declaration would commit to a Canada-style free trade agreement, a mutually agreed target end date for the negotiations, and empty promises to explore alternative arrangements for the Irish border. Is this what is giving Johnson “supreme confidence” that we will be out of the EU “do or die”?It could be a superficially attractive option, which might appear capable of achieving a majority in parliament. As it wouldn’t really mean leaving, it would surely meet Labour’s “six tests”. It would unite Labour MPs from strongly Brexit-supporting constituencies, such as Lisa Nandy, with those who have advocated a Norway-style agreement, such as Stephen Kinnock. Johnson may calculate that it would deliver enough Labour votes to cancel out the irreducible core of European Research Group (ERG) opponents. The EU itself would be delighted: no impediments to the single market, the weight of the UK economy in trade negotiations, and our sizeable financial contribution with none of the aggravation caused by British Europhobes. Crudely, the UK would effectively remain in the club, albeit with no say, and Nigel Farage would be kicked out of the European parliament to boot.But it is also a plan that is doomed to failure. If such a proposal were to be made, it would come unstuck in precisely the same way that May’s deal died on the backstop. The EU simply does not believe that alternative arrangements are possible for the Irish border. So the EU will refuse to commit to a legally binding end date for such a transition period. Johnson is badly miscalculating if he thinks the EU will abandon Ireland for the sake of a deal with the UK. Moreover, given how advantageous this arrangement would be to other EU member states, there would be virtually no incentive for negotiations on the future partnership to ever reach a conclusion.It would be quite the comeuppance for leave campaigners. After decades of poisoning Britain’s relations with our neighbours and three years of squabbling, the only Brexit they could make work would be one where we never really leave but give up control rather than take it back. Stubbornness would be its animating purpose; the Brexit project would have defeated itself. Shrewd Brexiters would know the clock will be ticking until the UK goes from such a standstill transition back to full membership, only with a worse deal than today, losing both the rebate and the opt-outs we currently enjoy.As a result, it would not face the 34 Tory opponents from May’s third attempt to pass the withdrawal agreement but more like the 75 who voted against it at the second attempt. Even if they believed that we would eventually arrive at a free trade agreement, the typical negotiation length is five to seven years, meaning as much as an additional £80bn in financial contributions with no say over how they are spent, the continuation of free movement (good for the country but detested by many Brexiters) and the entirety of EU regulation. So much for the promise of “taking back control of our laws, borders and money”.What’s more, if this is his strategy, Johnson is also badly misreading the mood of the Labour party. Sentiment is drifting away from a second referendum and towards revoking article 50 by a parliamentary vote. But more than that, this sort of plan would face fierce hostility from Jeremy Corbyn himself. Corbyn’s long-held Euroscepticism is firmly in the Bennite tradition: opposed to the EU on grounds of democracy and accountability. Labour’s six tests for Brexit would be replaced by Tony Benn’s five questions for the powerful. A solution that leaves Britain effectively in the EU but with no say runs entirely counter to his principles. If there was any plan that could provoke Corbyn from acquiescence to Brexit into outright opposition, this would be it.Even if it were to pass parliament, it would provoke an immediate general election. The government has a working majority of just three, and if Johnson were to deceive the ERG in this way, they would surely prevent him from being able to govern. It would provide the Brexit party with the perfect narrative of betrayal: leavers would say “we never left”, and remainers would ask “what was the point?” Both would be right. Can Johnson really believe it is possible to hoodwink the nation with a wheeze that leaves us in the EU but with no say? With the right split between the Tories and the Brexit party, it is hard to see the path to a general election victory in November. For that reason, the most likely outcome continues to be an October election prior to a no-deal exit, where Johnson calculates that he will have five clear years to clean up the mess and turn things around. And gaining and retaining power for himself is the only principle to which Johnson has ever shown any fidelity.• Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and chair of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice.

9229,"Supporters of the two Conservative leadership candidates have sought to play down the chances of a no-deal Brexit, after business groups reiterated their warnings about the economic damage this could wreak.Liam Fox, a supporter of Jeremy Hunt – who said on Sunday he would be willing to tell businesses that went bust because of no deal that it was a necessary sacrifice – said a new EU commission should be willing to make a deal.Meanwhile Matt Hancock, who after dropping out of the race himself threw his support behind Boris Johnson, said Johnson’s hard-and-fast deadline of 31 October meant departure with a deal was more likely.Business groups and Conservative sources expressed alarm after Hunt, normally seen as the more moderate of the pair on Brexit, told the BBC he would push for no deal if, by the start of October, there was no chance of a new negotiated settlement.Asked whether he would be willing to look the owners of family businesses in the eye and say they should be prepared to see their companies go bust to ensure a no-deal Brexit, Hunt said: “I would do so but I’d do it with a heavy heart precisely because of the risks.”At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn divorce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Martin BelamFox, the international trade secretary, said that while the UK was “not entirely in control” of whether no deal happened, he believed it would not.“You have got a new commission coming in, and we will have a new prime minister. The European Union have to listen to the economic realities,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live.“It’s rational. Britain is not asking for anything that’s unreasonable. We’re simply saying: we have an agreement to leave the European Union. We want some changes to the backstop arrangement to make it get through parliament. And then we can leave with a deal, which is in everybody’s interests.”However, Fox stressed he would prefer no deal to a second Brexit referendum.“It’s up to us to be very clear to the European Union that we want a deal, but if we can’t get one that’s satisfactory, we can’t get one that goes through parliament, then the default position within our law is that we leave without a deal, and we have to make the proper preparations so that is a credible position,” he said.Hunt was on Monday due to make a speech setting out a 10-point plan to mitigate the effects of no deal, including £6bn to protect fishing and agriculture. It would also include a new, dedicated committee with special powers to boost no-deal planning and a logistics committee to assist with imports and exports.Fox denied no deal would be disastrous, saying: “I’m not sure it would be catastrophic. I think that there would be problems, and that’s exactly what Jeremy Hunt is setting out today.”Hancock, the health secretary, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Johnson’s pledge to leave on 31 October “do or die” minimised the risk of no deal.“The reason that I’m [backing] Boris Johnson is because I think he’s best placed to deliver Brexit and then to unite the country,” he said.“The best way to deliver Brexit is with a deadline, and Boris is the only candidate with a deadline. No deadline risks no Brexit, and slip-sliding towards a second referendum, which I don’t want to see.”Hancock had a very different approach to Brexit when he was still in the race, and was challenged repeatedly on how he could now support Johnson. “You’ve got to look forward in life,” he said.Hancock indicated he still disliked the idea of proroguing, or suspending, the Commons to stop MPs blocking no deal, but refused to condemn Johnson for not ruling this out as a tactic.“I don’t foresee that happening. The whole point of Brexit – this where he and I strongly agree – is to return parliamentary sovereignty to the UK,” he said, adding: “I don’t think that that is where this is going to end up.”Hancock explained why he was now backing Johnson: “I clearly made my case to win, and I didn’t get the support in order to be able to proceed, and then you deal with the world as it is. And you have to ask the question: who is best placed to deliver Brexit? Answer: Boris Johnson.”He said: “Part of being able to deliver, when you’re in government, when you’re in politics, is about uniting people who have a range of views. And Boris’s ability to bring people behind him from different parts of the party is a great strength, and by God that’s needed.”",Brexit: both Tory sides play down risk of no-deal after business

9350,"Brussels has sounded a warning that Boris Johnson’s familiar use of “false promises, pseudo-patriotism and foreigner-bashing” to win the keys to Downing Street is locking Britain into a no-deal Brexit.In a withering attack on the Conservative leadership frontrunner, Guy Verhofstadt dismissed the idea that he could dump Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, withhold payment of the UK’s £39bn divorce bill and still negotiate a free-trade deal in Brussels as a “myth”. And he said that, years after the referendum, Johnson was “a man who continues to dissemble, exaggerate and disinform”.Verhofstadt’s assessment, which is shared by most European officials, is the most forceful European intervention so far into the Tories’ leadership election. In an article published by the Project Syndicate website and the Guardian, the former prime minister of Belgium concludes that Johnson and his rival, Jeremy Hunt, who also claims to be able to to renegotiate the Brexit deal, have “learned nothing whatsoever” from the last two years.The EU has repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the agreement and that the UK will crash out unless the House of Commons ratifies the full package, including the protocol containing the Irish backstop for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.But Johnson has said he believes that with “positive energy” he will be able to either persuade Brussels to ditch the backstop, which would otherwise keep the UK in a customs union until another border solution is found, or agree to a “standstill” in current relations through article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade.The latter claim has been described as “not true” by the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, among others. He pointed out article 24 requires EU agreement, which Brussels has said it will not give.EU officials and diplomats close to the last two years of talks have looked on aghast at the hardening of Johnson’s positions around what they regard as unfeasible proposals.Sources echoed Verhofstadt’s concerns on Thursday, saying that they feared an early visit to Brussels by Johnson, on becoming prime minister, could lock both sides into a no-deal Brexit.Officials said it would be desirable for Johnson to instead tour the EU capitals in order to gain a sense of what might be realistic before seeking concessions.One EU diplomat said there would be a natural desire to give a new prime minister a hearing but that there increasingly seemed little hope of reaching an accommodation.“Is the withdrawal agreement really dead?” asked one. “It’s crazy.”“You could possibly foresee add-ons to the deal to offer aspirational timelines for getting out of the Irish backstop,” said the source. “Maybe he could sell it at home. But Johnson is backing himself more into a corner every day.”EU diplomats said they recognised that much of Johnson’s positioning was designed to put the blame on the bloc for a no-deal exit.One diplomat said: “Without the withdrawal treaty there will be no standstill transition. It is in the draft treaty, nowhere else. The idea that the EU would stand by as Britain tears up a painstakingly negotiated treaty and then say, ‘Hey have a transition anyway,’ is frankly ridiculous.“Is Johnson serious? I hope he understands what he’s on about because no else does.“It is nonsense and is presumably meant to be incomprehensible for the purposes of his campaign unless he is completely divorced from reality.”In his article, Verhofstadt described Johnson in similar terms, saying that he appeared to be unable to stop spreading “untruths”.He added: “Chief among them is the myth that Britain can tear up the withdrawal agreement that May negotiated with the EU, withhold its financial commitments to the bloc and simultaneously start negotiating free-trade deals.“To Johnson’s followers, however, he is more prophet than politician: only he can deliver a mythical ‘true Brexit’ that will deliver the prosperity promised during the referendum campaign.“As is often the case with populists, reality does not square with Johnson’s ensorcelling combination of false promises, pseudo-patriotism and foreigner-bashing.“He and his fellow Brexiteers speak of a ‘global Britain’ that will trade freely with the rest of the world, even as they drag their country down a path strewn with uprooted trade ties and substantial new barriers to commerce.”The EU is due to announce the finalising of a trade deal with the Mercosur bloc – Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay – that will reduce tariffs on European products being exported to those countries.The EU has been keen to burnish its trade credentials after enjoying a purple patch of negotiations, including with Japan, with which it has struck the world’s largest bilateral free-trade deal.“With Johnson likely taking power in late July, Europe will have offered still more proof that Brexit is not only unnecessary but also detrimental to Britain’s economic interests,” Verhofstadt writes. “The ‘buccaneering’ Brexiteers might then finally have to explain what it is they’re still complaining about.”","Boris Johnson's foreigner-bashing tying UK to no-deal Brexit, says Brussels",2019-06-27/19:43:11,brussels has sounded a warning

9361,"French carmaker PSA Group has warned that it will only build its new Vauxhall Astra at its Ellesmere Port plant if the UK avoids a no-deal Brexit, in a stark indication of the importance of trade with the EU to the British car industry.The Astra is the bestselling model under the Vauxhall and Opel brands and will be built in Germany as well as at Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool, if severe Brexit disruption is avoided, PSA said on Thursday.However, PSA, the parent company of the Peugeot, Citroen and Vauxhall brands, gave a clear warning against a bad Brexit deal, which could disrupt the just-in-time deliveries on which high-volume carmakers depend.In its announcement, PSA said: “The decision on the allocation to the Ellesmere Port plant will be conditional on the final terms of the UK’s exit from the European Union and the acceptance of the New Vehicle Agreement, which has been negotiated with the Unite trade union.”The warning underlined the urgent calls from across the British car industry for a Brexit deal that avoids delays or tariffs at the UK border. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders this week warned that every extra minute of delay of goods at the border would cost the industry £50,000.If Astra production goes ahead in the UK under a smooth Brexit, the decision to build the vehicle at Ellesmere Port would be a major boost for the embattled British car industry and the 1,000 employees at the plant. Securing the new contract is thought to be vital for the future of the factory.Yet Boris Johnson, who won the largest vote from MPs in the first stage of the Conservative party leadership election, has said that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, “do or die”. PSA executives have not met Johnson. PSA also owns a Vauxhall plant in Luton, where it employs 1,200 people making the Vivaro van.Mick Chalmers, regional coordinating officer for the Unite trade union, said a no-deal Brexit would destroy Ellesmere Port’s “hope of securing the plant’s long-term future”.Ellesmere Port, which currently manufactures the Astra, beat off competition from a plant in Gliwice, Poland. The new model will be built from 2021 onwards, and will secure electric car production in the UK, an important consideration as the industry moves away from the combustion engine.PSA’s chief executive, Carlos Tavares, has previously made it clear the carmaker would not shy away from unpopular decisions, including shutting factories, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Fears over the Ellesmere Port plant’s future have swirled within the industry since the Brexit vote, although the fact that PSA held off making a decision – even as Honda and Ford announced closures of British factories – led some analysts to believe the company was keen to preserve it.The plant’s survival was probably aided by the quick turnaround of the Opel-Vauxhall business, which was bought by PSA for £1.9bn from US carmaker General Motors in 2017.Opel–Vauxhall reported its first annual profits in 20 years in 2018 after a major cost-cutting plan. During General Motors’ ownership, the company made $19bn (£15bn) in accumulated losses but Opel-Vauxhall made a profit of €859m in 2018.",Vauxhall Astra to be built in UK if ministers avoid no-deal Brexit,2019-06-27/16:23:47,french carmaker psa group has warned that it will only build its new vauxhall astra at its ellesmere port plant if the uk avoids a no deal brexit in a stark indication of the importance of trade with the eu to the british car industry the astra is the bestselling model under the vauxhall and opel brands and will be built in germany as well as at ellesmere port near liverpool if severe brexit disruption is avoided psa said on thursday however psa the parent company of the peugeot citroen and vauxhall brands gave a clear warning against a bad brexit deal which could disrupt the just in time deliveries on which high volume carmakers depend in its announcement psa said the decision on the allocation to the ellesmere port plant will be conditional on the final terms of the uk s exit from the european union and the acceptance of the new vehicle agreement which has been negotiated with the unite trade union the warning underlined the urgent calls from across the british car industry for a brexit deal that avoids delays or tariffs at the uk border the society of motor manufacturers and traders this week warned that every extra minute of delay of goods at the border would cost the industry   if astra production goes ahead in the uk under a smooth brexit the decision to build the vehicle at ellesmere port would be a major boost for the embattled british car industry and the   employees at the plant securing the new contract is thought to be vital for the future of the factory yet boris johnson who won the largest vote from mps in the first stage of the conservative party leadership election has said that the uk will leave the eu on  october do or die psa executives have not met johnson psa also owns a vauxhall plant in luton where it employs   people making the vivaro van mick chalmers regional coordinating officer for the unite trade union said a no deal brexit would destroy ellesmere port s hope of securing the plant s long term future ellesmere port which currently manufactures the astra beat off competition from a plant in gliwice poland the new model will be built from  onwards and will secure electric car production in the uk an important consideration as the industry moves away from the combustion engine psa s chief executive carlos tavares has previously made it clear the carmaker would not shy away from unpopular decisions including shutting factories in the event of a no deal brexit fears over the ellesmere port plant s future have swirled within the industry since the brexit vote although the fact that psa held off making a decision even as honda and ford announced closures of british factories led some analysts to believe the company was keen to preserve it the plant s survival was probably aided by the quick turnaround of the opel vauxhall business which was bought by psa for  bn from us carmaker general motors in  opel vauxhall reported its first annual profits in  years in  after a major cost cutting plan during general motors ownership the company made bn bn in accumulated losses but opel vauxhall made a profit of m in  ,Brexit,0.179876909
9378,"Japan’s foreign minister has pleaded with Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt not to lead the UK out of the EU without a deal when one of them becomes prime minister.In an unusually blunt warning, Tarō Kōno suggested Japanese companies operating in the UK would relocate to other countries in Europe in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“There are over 1,000 Japanese companies operating in the United Kingdom, so we are very concerned with this no-deal Brexit,” Kōno told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday.Both Johnson and Hunt have said they would be prepared to take the UK out of the EU without an agreement if they become prime minister. Kōno said he had asked both of them to avoid a no-deal Brexit.“Whenever we had a meeting that was one of the major issue[s], ‘please no no deal. No no-deal Brexit’,” he said. “Whatever they do is up to the UK government, but we just don’t want to have a negative impact on the foreign companies in the United Kingdom, including the Japanese.”Kōno said he was particularly worried about the implications of a no-deal Brexit for Japanese carmakers in the UK.Speaking as Theresa May is due to visit Japan for the G20 summit in Osaka on Friday and Saturday, he said: “There are a few Japanese auto manufacturers operating in the United Kingdom and some parts are coming from continental Europe, and right now they have very smooth operations.“Their stock for each part is only for a few hours, but if there is [a] no-deal Brexit and if they have to go through actual custom[s] inspection, physically, those operations may not be able to continue. And many companies are worried about [the] implications, because they don’t know what’s going to happen.“Some companies have already start[ed] moving their operation[s] to other place[s] in Europe, so we do not want disrupt [the] economic relationship with the UK. So we have been asking the UK government [to] let the Japanese companies know what they can expect and [that] things should happen smoothly without any disruption.”Kōno said he knew both the former and the current foreign secretaries very well and revealed he had a signed copy of Johnson’s book about Winston Churchill and was impressed with Hunt’s ability to speak Japanese.But he urged them to take care of Japan’s companies operating in the UK when one of them becomes prime minister, warning Japanese investment was in jeopardy.Asked about the prospect of a bilateral free-trade agreement with the UK, Kōno said any negotiations would have to wait until after the UK leaves the EU. “You have to leave the EU first to be able to negotiate, so it would take some time. There [is] going to be some kind of gap between when the UK leaves the EU and when we can ratify [a] new trade deal.”",Japan says next British PM must not lead UK out of EU without deal,2019-06-27/09:31:36,japan s foreign minister has pleaded with boris johnson and jeremy hunt not to lead the uk out of the eu without a deal when one of them becomes prime minister in an unusually blunt warning tarō kōno suggested japanese companies operating in the uk would relocate to other countries in europe in the event of a no deal brexit there are over   japanese companies operating in the united kingdom so we are very concerned with this no deal brexit kōno told bbc radio  s today programme on thursday both johnson and hunt have said they would be prepared to take the uk out of the eu without an agreement if they become prime minister kōno said he had asked both of them to avoid a no deal brexit whenever we had a meeting that was one of the major issue s please no no deal no no deal brexit he said whatever they do is up to the uk government but we just don t want to have a negative impact on the foreign companies in the united kingdom including the japanese kōno said he was particularly worried about the implications of a no deal brexit for japanese carmakers in the uk speaking as theresa may is due to visit japan for the g summit in osaka on friday and saturday he said there are a few japanese auto manufacturers operating in the united kingdom and some parts are coming from continental europe and right now they have very smooth operations their stock for each part is only for a few hours but if there is a no deal brexit and if they have to go through actual custom s inspection physically those operations may not be able to continue and many companies are worried about the implications because they don t know what s going to happen some companies have already start ed moving their operation s to other place s in europe so we do not want disrupt the economic relationship with the uk so we have been asking the uk government to let the japanese companies know what they can expect and that things should happen smoothly without any disruption kōno said he knew both the former and the current foreign secretaries very well and revealed he had a signed copy of johnson s book about winston churchill and was impressed with hunt s ability to speak japanese but he urged them to take care of japan s companies operating in the uk when one of them becomes prime minister warning japanese investment was in jeopardy asked about the prospect of a bilateral free trade agreement with the uk kōno said any negotiations would have to wait until after the uk leaves the eu you have to leave the eu first to be able to negotiate so it would take some time there is going to be some kind of gap between when the uk leaves the eu and when we can ratify a new trade deal ,Brexit,0.242181391
9456,"Germany will fight to the last hour to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal and is willing to hear any fresh ideas for the Irish border backstop, the country’s ambassador to the UK has said.Speaking at a car manufacturers’ summit in London, Peter Wittig said Germany cherished its relationship with the UK and was ready to talk about solutions the new prime minister might have for the Irish border problem.“My country is ready to talk and the chancellor [Angela Merkel] once said she would be willing to talk to the last hour not to have a no-deal scenario,” he said.“It’s a mindset. We are not giving up in achieving an orderly Brexit. Germany has been a very pragmatic voice in this whole tortuous Brexit process and we will continue to be that.“Even if we have a short window while the new prime minister is in place, we will welcome any idea how to solve that famous backstop issue and we will be willing to work towards a negotiated deal which is long term the only viable and sensible option for Europe,” he added.Asked if Germany would support another extension in the Brexit process, he said: “We can’t be more specific. It is now the turn of the UK government to come up with the plan and talk to us [the EU].“Our mindset is to explore all pathways to come to a negotiated deal.”The German envoy’s comments came as motor industry leaders warned that the cost of car manufacturing would go up £70m a day if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, making the British automotive industry more vulnerable to closures,.They also warned for the second time this year that car prices will go up by an average of £1,500.“Leaving the EU without a deal would trigger the most seismic shift in trading conditions ever experienced by automotive, with billions of pounds of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability,” said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) at an industry conference in London.“The end to borderless trade could bring crippling disruptions to the industry’s just-in-time operating model. Delays to shipments of parts to production plants are measured in minutes, with every 60 seconds costing £50,000 in gross value added – amounting to some £70m a day in a worst-case scenario,” it added.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn divorce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Martin BelamIn a report, the SMMT said the imposition of tariffs for trade in passenger cars along would be £4.5bn, a “knockout blow” to the sector’s competitiveness.The industry has already lost two big names in the past year with the closure of Honda in Swindon in 2021 and the axing of the Ford plant in Bridgend in Wales with the loss of thousands of jobs.While neither Honda nor Ford cited Brexit as a cause, the industry fears Britain’s competitiveness and unstable political environment will deter future investment by global car manufacturers.Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: “We are already seeing investment stall. As a manufacturer you constantly invest in machinery to make sure you are more efficient, make sure you are competitive.“When the big investment decisions come with a new model, that’s when you are competing with other plants, that’s when you need to be at your most efficient and if in the previous two or three years you have underinvested it makes it much harder.”Few car companies want to go public on their fears over Brexit because of the backlash in the media and some political interests, sources say.Hawes said the analysis of tariffs was based on facts, on industry and government data and warned that his pleas were not fearmongering.“We are not making claims that the entire industry will close doors overnight, this industry is adaptable and agile, but it can only do so much if the barriers are particularly high,” he said.He warned the industry would decline with a “death by a thousand cuts”.Costs could be hit by stoppages in production lines in the event of delays to supply of components over the Calais-Dover transit route and also by the imposition of tariffs of between 2% and 4.5% by the EU.The car industry has little to no warehousing capacity to stockpile in the event of no deal with production based on just-in-time and just-in-sequence systems.“We have 1,100 vehicles a day coming into the UK with parts, components, we need them to move seamlessly. If we have delivery delays, that means production stops,” he said.Some component manufacturers have also been hit by the Brexit uncertainty, Hawes said, including one company in south Wales.",Germany

9471,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, doing its best to make sense of all this nonsense since June 2016. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here.In case you’ve been residing temporarily on another planet, the former and current foreign secretaries, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, made it through to the final runoff round of the Conservative leadership contest.Almost instantly, Johnson became embroiled in a row over a late-night altercation with his girlfriend that was loud and worrying enough for a neighbour to call the police – but not for the the potential future PM to answer any questions about.Johnson came under increasing pressure to explain the row not just from Hunt, who accused the former London mayor of trying to “slink through the back door” of No 10 by “pathetically” evading questioning, but other ministers and a major Tory donor. Hunt later upped the ante as Johnson refused to appear on a Sky debate.Johnson’s Brexit plans – including a no-deal exit “if necessary” on 31 October, with article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ensuring there would be no tariffs on UK exports to the EU – were also criticised as pie in the sky by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox.Despite all the above, however, polls found that the former London mayor – although his popularity took a substantial hit – was still seen by Conservative members (his immediate electorate) as more trusted to make big decisions and negotiate with the EU, and more competent, than his rival.At an EU summit in Brussels, meanwhile, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, said Johnson might make the Brexit process “even more exciting”, but the withdrawal agreement had been sealed and would not change.EU leaders now think Britain will crash out of the EU on 31 October unless the deal is ratified or the new PM calls a second referendum or election this summer. Britain’s former envoy to the EU, Ivan Rogers, said the country was being led to no deal by a political elite who had “great difficulties discerning and telling the truth”.Should an early election (see below) end up being called, the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, went on the record as saying he would be interested in local coalition pacts with the Conservatives to help ensure the UK left the EU without a deal.At the other end of the political spectrum, Hilary Benn called Brexit a “complete and utter mess” and demanded that Labour unambiguously back a second referendum, while Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said the party would have to back remain to survive.More and more people think early elections are likely after the new prime minister engages unsuccessfully with EU capitals and Michel Barnier’s team to obtain the changes to the Irish backstop he thinks might get the deal through parliament (none exist, as this piece makes clear).Several MPs have “huge concerns” about whether Johnson or Hunt could command the confidence of the Commons and avoid an autumn election, and the junior defence minister Tobias Ellwood said up to a dozen Conservative MPs could support a no-confidence motion against the new government.Johnson could also decide to trigger an election himself with the backing of two-thirds of MPs, but would be unlikely to be able to organise it before the 31 October Brexit deadline without an extension, which he will not want to ask for.That makes a no-deal exit more likely, many analysts believe. But so too, if there is an election, could be a new Tory government backed by the Brexit party – or a pro-remain Labour government backed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP.UK finances forecast to suffer under most forms of Brexit.Brexit: alternative to Irish backstop “feasible in three years”.Brexit viewed with incredulity overseas, says ambassador.Ease migration rules for Indians to win post-Brexit deals, say MPs.Vital medicine supplies at risk if UK crashes out of EU, MPs warned.Barclay and Barnier clash on citizens’ rights under no-deal Brexit.In the Guardian, Anand Menon and Alan Wager say the contest between Johnson and Hunt is really about who can win a looming general election:None of the Brexit tales being told by the candidates bears any relationship to the real world. Each candidate will immediately confront two sobering realities: their demands aren’t negotiable, and they have to get something through a hung parliament with no majority for anything. An internal mandate from the Tory party may be all that’s needed to grab the keys to No 10. But actually doing something once in there requires a very different sort of mandate – one that can change the numbers of the House of Commons. This, remember, is a parliament which has the numbers to block a deal and also block no deal. To support solutions the EU will never countenance and to reject a referendum. Which is why what the candidates say does not really matter. How they solve the parliamentary conundrum does. So it’s down to Johnson and Hunt, and as their plans unfold one thing will become increasingly clear: those same Tory members are not really voting for someone to fix Brexit. They are voting for someone who might win the election that will be necessary for Brexit to be fixed.Might Brexit – or at any rate, Boris Johnson as PM – mean the end of the union?UK (Scotland),

9501,"The question, set less by Brussels than the logic of Brexit, is how the UK government can in one move leave the European union’s single market and customs while also maintaining the flow of trade and people on its one land border with the bloc in IrelandThe fact that the existence of the land border in question cost more than 3,600 lives over 30 years led to the British government in December 2017 restating its commitment to avoid “a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls”.Avoiding a backdoor for smugglers into the single market is additionally regarded as essential by Dublin and the European commission, as is avoiding crippling extra bureaucracy on Irish businesses.The so-called Irish backstop in the 585-page withdrawal agreement – to remain in place “unless and until” an alternative solution for keeping the border open is found – offers one solution by doing two key things.First, Northern Ireland stays within the EU’s regulatory regime, and under direct jurisdiction of the European court of justice, so as to allow a single market for goods on the island of Ireland.Second, the whole of the UK shares a customs territory with the EU to avoid any checks on goods both between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.But rejected three times by the Commons on the grounds that the UK could be tied into the backstop indefinitely, leaving the government unable to sign its own comprehensive trade deals, the withdrawal agreement is said by Boris Johnson, still the frontrunner in the Tory leadership battle, to be “defunct”.What is the alternative? In recent days, Johnson has suggested that the EU and UK could give themselves more time to work on the problem by relying on “Gatt 24 or whatever it happens to be” to provide for a “standstill in our current arrangements”.Under article XXIV of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, tariffs would remain at zero even under a no-deal exit on 31 October for up to a decade, it is said. The agreement could additionally leave the Irish border open while the two sides sought a new accommodation.The problem for Johnson, in the words of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, is that this “isn’t true”. Article XXIV is only relevant if there is an an agreement in principle on a free trade deal. It gives the two parties time to turn an interim deal into a final one.But the EU has said that the first and necessary step towards a trade deal is ratification of the withdrawal agreement. And the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said that without a legally binding guarantee that a hard border will not reemerge there will be no withdrawal agreement.In the light of this, interest has been aroused in a 201-page report published on Monday by a non-government organisation calling itself the Alternative Arrangements Commission.Backed by two former ministers, Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, it has suggested that by 2022 a solution could be in place using a mix of technology, trusted trade schemes, mobile checks on food and animals within a new joint Irish-British Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) zone, special economic zones to push customs checks away from the border and a certain amount of looking the other way.The problems with it are legion. By imposing checks within a newly delineated border zone it fails the central task of avoiding new checks, and creates targets for terrorists in the new mobile veterinary vans. The burden of Brexit is put on Irish businesses. The exemptions on checks for many crossing the border will set off alarm bells for those concerned about the integrity of the single market.But the central problem for Brussels is that the plan is theoretical.There remains no certainty at all that the complicated IT systems, democratic consultation on the creation of new economic zones or negotiations with the European commission on the finer detail would be finalised by the end of the transition period of “standstill” relations.The Irish backstop would then have to remain to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border.

9922,"Have MPs missed their last chance to block a no-deal Brexit?Not quite. Labour seized the opportunity for action on Wednesday because they had been allotted an opposition day debate – an opportunity to decide what MPs discuss and vote on.They may not get another such day in this parliamentary session; and without that, or any looming legislation they can try to amend, there may be few parliamentary moments when concerned MPs can try to bind the hands of the next prime minister.Does the result mean there’s now no majority against a no-deal Brexit?It was certainly a relatively comfortable victory for the government: a majority of 11, compared with its defeat on the Cooper-Letwin bill, which passed by one vote in April.But Labour conceded even before the vote that it is always harder to persuade Conservative MPs to back a motion tabled in the name of Jeremy Corbyn, as this one was, rather than a backbench-led initiative.And the timing, in the middle of the Tory leadership contest, was also tricky. Many Conservative MPs may have felt any new leader deserves the opportunity to try to pursue their own Brexit plan first, before parliament starts trying to tie their hands.Could we still leave the EU with a deal?Yes – and Boris Johnson, the leading candidate to be Britain’s next prime minister, has said that’s his aim. He has declined to say what he will do if he is unable to secure the concessions he plans to demand from Brussels – but has insisted we must leave on 31 October, with or without a deal.So how could no deal be stopped?It looks as though the only remaining option is likely to be the most explosive one – bringing down the government.The Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve made clear in the course of the debate that he would be prepared to vote against his party in a no-confidence motion, if a future prime minister were to try to take Britain out of the EU without a deal.“If we get to a point where a prime minister is intent on doing this [taking the UK out of the EU without a deal], the only way of stopping that prime minister would be to bring down that prime minister’s government. And I simply have to say here and now I will not hesitate to do that if that is what is attempted, even if it means my resigning the whip and leaving the party,” he said.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has hinted he might also be prepared to do the same thing.With the Conservatives’ majority wafer-thin, Grieve and Hammond would not need to be joined by many others to bring down the government.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, if a government loses a no-confidence vote, alternative leaders have a fortnight to try to assemble a parliamentary majority – and if they are unable to do so, a general election must be called. Whether that would resolve the Brexit impasse, it is impossible to say.",MPs' no-deal vote – what does this mean for Brexit?,2019-06-12/20:50:34,have mps missed their last chance to block a no deal brexit not quite labour seized the opportunity for action on wednesday because they had been allotted an opposition day debate an opportunity to decide what mps discuss and vote on they may not get another such day in this parliamentary session and without that or any looming legislation they can try to amend there may be few parliamentary moments when concerned mps can try to bind the hands of the next prime minister does the result mean there s now no majority against a no deal brexit it was certainly a relatively comfortable victory for the government a majority of  compared with its defeat on the cooper letwin bill which passed by one vote in april but labour conceded even before the vote that it is always harder to persuade conservative mps to back a motion tabled in the name of jeremy corbyn as this one was rather than a backbench led initiative and the timing in the middle of the tory leadership contest was also tricky many conservative mps may have felt any new leader deserves the opportunity to try to pursue their own brexit plan first before parliament starts trying to tie their hands could we still leave the eu with a deal yes and boris johnson the leading candidate to be britain s next prime minister has said that s his aim he has declined to say what he will do if he is unable to secure the concessions he plans to demand from brussels but has insisted we must leave on  october with or without a deal so how could no deal be stopped it looks as though the only remaining option is likely to be the most explosive one bringing down the government the conservative former attorney general dominic grieve made clear in the course of the debate that he would be prepared to vote against his party in a no confidence motion if a future prime minister were to try to take britain out of the eu without a deal if we get to a point where a prime minister is intent on doing this taking the uk out of the eu without a deal the only way of stopping that prime minister would be to bring down that prime minister s government and i simply have to say here and now i will not hesitate to do that if that is what is attempted even if it means my resigning the whip and leaving the party he said the chancellor philip hammond has hinted he might also be prepared to do the same thing with the conservatives majority wafer thin grieve and hammond would not need to be joined by many others to bring down the government under the fixed term parliaments act if a government loses a no confidence vote alternative leaders have a fortnight to try to assemble a parliamentary majority and if they are unable to do so a general election must be called whether that would resolve the brexit impasse it is impossible to say ,Brexit,0.288385868
9943,"A no-deal Brexit will create severe problems for Northern Irish businesses and oblige the Republic of Ireland to build border inspection posts, a report has said.Firms will have “limited room for manoeuvre” as they face an array of export checks, inspections and declarations, according to the report, which was commissioned by Northern Ireland’s Department for the Economy and published this week.It was a sobering reflection on the challenges if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, according to its authors, Eric Pickett and Michael Lux, lawyers who specialise in EU and international customs law.“In particular, it confirms the Northern Ireland civil service’s concern about the impact of EU tariffs on food exports to Ireland, and the ability of micro and small enterprises with no experience in customs procedures and operations to continue to export to Ireland,” said a cover note. More than 80% of small Northern Irish exporters trade only with the republic.The study said Ireland would need to establish inspection posts close to Northern Ireland to monitor trade in animal and food products, raising the spectre of a hard border that has prompted alarm from politicians and police chiefs who worry about attacks by dissident republicans.The report said use of technology such as electronic monitoring could be expanded but would not obviate the need for physical inspections. It also said the UK and EU could seek an exemption from World Trade Organization rules requiring tariffs and checks, but that it would probably be temporary.The EU has strict rules for checking animals and food products at border inspection posts (BIPS) near the point of entry. Ireland’s existing posts at Dublin airport, Dublin port and Shannon airport are more than 60 miles from the border. “Consequently, Ireland will have to establish BIPS which are closer to the border,” said the report.The findings were a blunt reminder that there is no easy fix to the Irish border conundrum that has bedevilled the UK’s attempt to leave the EU and presented a dilemma for the Conservative party leadership candidates vying to replace Theresa May.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn divorce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Martin BelamThe report noted that Switzerland and European Economic Area countries have derogation from inspection rules but that is because they have a deal with the EU. “The problem is that under a no-deal scenario, this option is not available.”Boris Johnson, Andrea Leadsom, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey have vowed that if they win the Tory leadership they will take the UK out of the EU on 31 October regardless of whether or not a deal is in place.This week’s report follows a series of other warnings about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland. David Sterling, the head of its civil service, wrote to local political parties in March saying it could undermine security and worsen unemployment.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Tuesday that it would be a “terrible political miscalculation” for anyone in London to think that a new prime minister would prompt the EU to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. “That is really to misunderstand how

10004,"The EU has been on a Brexit break since the UK secured a six-month delay to its departure. With Theresa May soon to leave 10 Downing Street, Brussels is tuning in to the Westminster drama of the Tory leadership race – with both amazement and exasperation.“People in Brussels are fed up that the political class in the UK has gone a little bit crazy,” Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council’s legal service said. British politicians seemed to have gone “on holiday”, since gaining the extension, he added.For the EU, the bookies’ favourite Boris Johnson, is a Trumpian figure whose disputed claims and bombastic rhetoric played a major role in plunging the UK into what is seen in Brussels as the Brexit nightmare.The former foreign secretary is remembered for his early 1990s stint as Brussels correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, where he made his name mocking EU regulations, promoting what the European commission calls “Euromyths”. He achieved wider prominence for his claims during the EU referendum campaign. “He lied a lot to the British people,” the then French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said in 2016.“The idea of Boris Johnson in the European council is probably quite abhorrent to some EU leaders,” an EU source said. “Boris is known in foreign policy circles, certainly not respected. He’s also seen as part of a wider Trump world and no one wants that.”The EU’s most senior civil servant, Martin Selmayr, once described a Johnson premiership as a “horror scenario”, classing him with Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump.#G7 2017 with Trump, Le Pen, Boris Johnson, Beppe Grillo? A horror scenario that shows well why it is worth fighting populism. #withJunckerMany EU insiders think the chances of no deal have increased, with the Tory party expected to choose a Brexiter prime minister.“For me it is very clear the odds of no-deal Brexit are more than half and clearly if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister the odds will go up again,” said Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP and member of the European parliament’s Brexit steering group.Another favourite, Dominic Raab, is held in low-esteem in Brussels. During his four-month tenure as Brexit secretary, he lost trust of his EU counterparts. “He was seen to be working against his prime minister and making things up,” the first EU source said.The European commission recently accused Raab of making “fraudulent” claims and spreading “pure disinformation” in a campaign video about the views of its secretary-general, Selmayr, on the future of Ireland.Responding to unfavourable reports from Brussels, Raab told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show that it “probably tells you that I was doing my job in terms of pressing them hard and making sure that Britain’s interests were resolutely defended”.Candidates deemed compromise choices at Westminster have also inspired mistrust in Brussels. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is reported to have struck a different tone on Brexit with his EU counterparts than the public stance he takes in the UK. “He gave a very different impression than what he is suggesting now,” an EU diplomat said. More recently, Hunt has toned down his views on no deal, warning it would be “political suicide”.EU officials expect Tory candidates will be falling over themselves to prove their hard-Brexit credentials, following the party’s poor showing in the European elections, where just four of its MEPs were elected and Nigel Farage’s Brexit party won the most votes. “The Tory party will be in survival mode and … will have to regain credibility as the party of Brexit,” another EU source said.His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt’s attempts to talk up a backstory as an 'underestimated' entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse.Overall, Hunt’s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the 'Theresa in trousers' nickname among some Tory MPs – one that is more catchy than accurate (since May herself often wears trousers).In the final round of MP voting Hunt edged out Michael Gove, 77 votes to 75.Johnson’s progress to Downing Street appeared unstoppable even before an overwhelming victory in the first round of voting among MPs. Most of his colleagues believe it is now all but inevitable that he will be Britain’s next prime minister.His well-disciplined campaign team will continue with their strategy of subjecting him to minimal media exposure, though once the field is narrowed down to two, the final pair will appear in more than a dozen head-to-head hustings for Tory members. The team’s main aim is simply to keep heads down and avoid Johnson creating headlines for the wrong reasons. It may not have worked. Johnson came first in the final round of MP voting with 160 votes.For many, the leadership race is an unedifying fight for power, while the clock ticks down remorselessly to Brexit day on 31 October.More governments are coming round to the tough position of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who argued against a long extension on the grounds that Brexit would become a damaging and distracting burden for the EU.Donald Tusk, the European council president, helped persuade member states to back a longer extension, which he urged the UK not to waste.“We were definitely on the other side of Macron,” the diplomat recalled. “Now I think Macron was right. We were wrong. Tusk was wrong.”“[Macron] closed the door [to another extension] and it’s not shut, but the wind is blowing against it. And the harder Johnson’s rhetoric, and harder Raab’s rhetoric, the harder it is to open the door.”Asked about the Tory contest last month, Tusk said there was “nothing promising” in “the state of affairs in London”.Many in the EU would support an extension for what is known in Brussels as “a democratic event”, meaning a general election or a second referendum.Without that, Piris thinks EU leaders could say no to a further extension. “But even if they say yes. What would happen? There is an inability to solve this question in the House of Commons.”He stresses the Brexit conundrum is not down to an individual Tory leader. “It is a question of the political system of the UK being unable to answer to such a unique event in the life of the nation.”Lamberts warns that nothing will change for May’s successor, as the EU will refuse to reopen the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop. “Anyone who steps into Downing Street will face exactly the same constraints. Saying you want to renegotiate this agreement is nice and well, but it won’t happen,” he said.Meanwhile, the Tory contest is not keeping Brussels on the edge of its seat. “We really don’t care very much [who wins]” the diplomat said. “From an EU point of view, we would rather see someone that could deliver a smooth, orderly Brexit. Whether Johnson is going to be able to deliver it, the UK is going to have to ask itself.”","EU view of Tory leadership candidates deeply critical, say sources",2019-06-11/06:00:23,the eu has been on

10097,"A pro-choice charity that for decades has helped thousands of Irish women access abortions in England is sending foreign nationals to the Netherlands due to tighter UK visa regulations and the effects of Brexit.The Abortion Support Network (ASN) said it was guiding immigrant women in Ireland towards Dutch abortion facilities because it was taking too long to obtain visas for English clinics.The London-based organisation also warned that even EU citizens living in the republic may have to travel to Holland for terminations after Brexit rather than crossing the Irish Sea.ASN saidit was focusing on helping women from Ireland who were more than 12 weeks into a crisis pregnancy – the new legal limit for terminations in Ireland, which was introduced after the historic 2018 referendum to introduce abortion into the state.One of ASN’s principal concerns is for immigrant women such as a young African girl who became pregnant after being raped by soldiers in a civil war and made her way to Ireland. In 2014, she was refused an abortion in Ireland and forced to go through with the pregnancy by caesarean section in an Irish hospital.Other examples include a refugee who was pregnant when she arrived in Ireland but was afraid to tell anyone until she was 17 weeks. She spoke no English and had little support from the few people she knew in Ireland. Despite efforts to help her, the client was unable to travel to get an abortion before she reached the legal limit in Amsterdam. So she was forced to continue her pregnancy because ASN could not get her a visa to the UK in time.Mara Clarke, ASN’s director, told the Guardian it had noticed that since the Brexit vote and the Irish abortion referendum it was getting harder to obtain visas for these women to travel from Ireland to Britain.“For the past two years we’ve been finding it more and more difficult for non-EU residents of Ireland to get visas into the UK. And bear in mind that a ‘non-EU resident’ can be defined as anyone from an asylum seeker to a student from South Africa.“We’ve found it easier for those people to go to clinics in Holland where they go to 22 weeks and five days.”Clarke said many of their cases dealing with non-Irish women needing abortions beyond 12 weeks had been dogged by visa delays.“We had one case where a client was turned down five months after applying for a visa into the UK. There was another case where the UK part of the visa was approved a day and a half before the Irish part expired, so we had to pull in favours to get the client an appointment in an English clinic as well as paying a premium for last-minute flights.”Clarke said that after consulting with organisations representing immigrants in Ireland ASN decided it would be easier to send clients to the Netherlands.“This means it is no longer possible for the woman to take the trip in one day but it’s better than nothing. I want to make clear that our only issue is with the UK visa process, not with the UK clinics,” Clarke said.She warned that when Britain finally leaves the EU this could have major implications, even for European citizens who live in the Irish Republic. Irish citizens will have a special right to travel to Britain unhindered under the Ireland-UK Common Travel Area agreement between the two states. However, this will not apply to other EU citizens.Explaining why Dutch clinics may be ASN clients’ best option after Brexit, Clarke said: “Any Brexit impact on travel – whether it is people needing a passport that is valid for a certain amount of time, or people needing visas or other travel documentation – will impact on people travelling for abortion. Even extra delays at airport security post-Brexit could mean people travelling from Ireland to England would be forced to stay overnight at clinics instead of coming in and out in one day.”Over the last five years, ASN has helped 681 women from Northern Ireland, 53 from the Isle of Man and 2,605 from the Irish Republic to have terminations at clinics in England. The group has given 975 clients £298,741 in financial support to pay for abortions in the same period in English clinics.The Irish Refugee Council (IRC) in Dublin said delays in treating non-Irish women who were in crisis pregnancies made it more likely they would have to travel abroad for an abortion.Nick Henderson, the IRC’s chief executive said: “In the experience of the Irish Refugee Council, particularly for a person who is the victim of sexual violence, it can be very difficult to disclose their experience and that they might be pregnant. This can cause a delay for people newly arriving in the jurisdiction and they may be well outside the 12 weeks before they seek help. With each delay it becomes more likely that a person seeking asylum will need to travel for an abortion.”",Brexit effect forces women to go to Netherlands for abortions,2019-06-07/15:57:02,a pro choice charity that for decades has helped thousands of irish women access abortions in england is sending foreign nationals to the netherlands due to tighter uk visa regulations and the effects of brexit the abortion support network asn said it was guiding immigrant women in ireland towards dutch abortion facilities because it was taking too long to obtain visas for english clinics the london based organisation also warned that even eu citizens living in the republic may have to travel to holland for terminations after brexit rather than crossing the irish sea asn saidit was focusing on helping women from ireland who were more than  weeks into a crisis pregnancy the new legal limit for terminations in ireland which was introduced after the historic  referendum to introduce abortion into the state one of asn s principal concerns is for immigrant women such as a young african girl who became pregnant after being raped by soldiers in a civil war and made her way to ireland in  she was refused an abortion in ireland and forced to go through with the pregnancy by caesarean section in an irish hospital other examples include a refugee who was pregnant when she arrived in ireland but was afraid to tell anyone until she was  weeks she spoke no english and had little support from the few people she knew in ireland despite efforts to help her the client was unable to travel to get an abortion before she reached the legal limit in amsterdam so she was forced to continue her pregnancy because asn could not get her a visa to the uk in time mara clarke asn s director told the guardian it had noticed that since the brexit vote and the irish abortion referendum it was getting harder to obtain visas for these women to travel from ireland to britain for the past two years we ve been finding it more and more difficult for non eu residents of ireland to get visas into the uk and bear in mind that a non eu resident can be defined as anyone from an asylum seeker to a student from south africa we ve found it easier for those people to go to clinics in holland where they go to  weeks and five days clarke said many of their cases dealing with non irish women needing abortions beyond  weeks had been dogged by visa delays we had one case where a client was turned down five months after applying for a visa into the uk there was another case where the uk part of the visa was approved a day and a half before the irish part expired so we had to pull in favours to get the client an appointment in an english clinic as well as paying a premium for last minute flights clarke said that after consulting with organisations representing immigrants in ireland asn decided it would be easier to send clients to the netherlands this means it is no longer possible for the woman to take the trip in one day but it s better than nothing i want to make clear that our only issue is with the uk visa process not with the uk clinics clarke said she warned that when britain finally leaves the eu this could have major implications even for european citizens who live in the irish republic irish citizens will have a special right to travel to britain unhindered under the ireland uk common travel area agreement between the two states however this will not apply to other eu citizens explaining why dutch clinics may be asn clients best option after brexit clarke said any brexit impact on travel whether it is people needing a passport that is valid for a certain amount of time or people needing visas or other travel documentation will impact on people travelling for abortion even extra delays at airport security post brexit could mean people travelling from ireland to england would be forced to stay overnight at clinics instead of coming in and out in one day over the last five years asn has helped  women from northern ireland  from the isle of man and   from the irish republic to have terminations at clinics in england the group has given  clients   in financial support to pay for abortions in the same period in english clinics the irish refugee council irc in dublin said delays in treating non irish women who were in crisis pregnancies made it more likely they would have to travel abroad for an abortion nick henderson the irc s chief executive said in the experience of the irish refugee council particularly for a person who is the victim of sexual violence it can be very difficult to disclose their experience and that they might be pregnant this can cause a delay for people newly arriving in the jurisdiction and they may be well outside the  weeks before they seek help with each delay it becomes more likely that a person seeking asylum will need to travel for an abortion ,Brexit,0.165878609
10312,"Irish commentators have condemned Sajid Javid for describing Ireland as “the tail that wags the dog” on Brexit.The home secretary made the comments as he continued to expand on his Tory leadership pitch, setting out how his Brexit plan hinged on coming up with an alternative to the Irish backstop.“I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through parliament – that was the withdrawal agreement with a change to the backstop,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “[Ireland] is the tail that wags the dog on this and we need to make sure we can do more to build that goodwill in Ireland and build their confidence.”The comments were seen by many in Ireland as a diplomatic faux pas. “Using a term like that is very unfortunate and I would be appealing to representatives in the UK to be mindful of their rhetoric,” said Neale Richmond, a senator from the governing Fine Gael party who chairs the Irish parliament’s Brexit committee.“We saw that as well in December with [the Tory MP] Priti Patel talking about Britain preventing food imports to Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, in ignorance that we had a major famine here. It also feeds into the misconception that somehow Ireland and the EU are separate or we are taking order from masters. We are and have been unified in this process, even if that appears to have taken some people in the UK by surprise.”Richmond took issue with Javid’s call for the UK to “make a grand gesture to Ireland” by covering all of the costs of creating a “modern, digitised border” between the two countries.“It’s not about cost. It’s about upholding the legal responsibility as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday agreement by maintaining a seamless border. No realistic digital or technological solutions have been proposed,” Richmond said.He also criticised another Tory leadership contender, Andrea Leadsom, for describing her Brexit plan as a “managed exit”.Other commentators also criticised Javid’s comments. “Sajid seems to be proposing a reverse Trump: we are not going to build a wall and Ireland’s not going to pay for it … Hmm,” tweeted Matthew O’Toole, a former civil servant who worked at No 10 under David Cameron.",Sajid Javid criticised for calling Ireland 'tail that wags the dog' on Brexit,2019-06-02/17:06:32,irish commentators have condemned sajid javid for describing ireland as the tail that wags the dog on brexit the home secretary made the comments as he continued to expand on his tory leadership pitch setting out how his brexit plan hinged on coming up with an alternative to the irish backstop i will focus on the one brexit deal that has already got through parliament that was the withdrawal agreement with a change to the backstop he told the bbc s andrew marr show ireland is the tail that wags the dog on this and we need to make sure we can do more to build that goodwill in ireland and build their confidence the comments were seen by many in ireland as a diplomatic faux pas using a term like that is very unfortunate and i would be appealing to representatives in the uk to be mindful of their rhetoric said neale richmond a senator from the governing fine gael party who chairs the irish parliament s brexit committee we saw that as well in december with the tory mp priti patel talking about britain preventing food imports to ireland in the event of a no deal brexit in ignorance that we had a major famine here it also feeds into the misconception that somehow ireland and the eu are separate or we are taking order from masters we are and have been unified in this process even if that appears to have taken some people in the uk by surprise richmond took issue with javid s call for the uk to make a grand gesture to ireland by covering all of the costs of creating a modern digitised border between the two countries it s not about cost it s about upholding the legal responsibility as a co guarantor of the good friday agreement by maintaining a seamless border no realistic digital or technological solutions have been proposed richmond said he also criticised another tory leadership contender andrea leadsom for describing her brexit plan as a managed exit other commentators also criticised javid s comments sajid seems to be proposing a reverse trump we are not going to build a wall and ireland s not going to pay for it hmm tweeted matthew o toole a former civil servant who worked at no  under david cameron ,Brexit,0.223455161
10523,"The European elections were meaningless. They can be read any way we want. Brexit won, but with a third of the vote, against anti-Brexit parties with much the same. Stir in a third of “others”, including Tories, Labour and nationalists, and soon all we get is noise. Britain still has a Tory government and a Labour opposition, both broken-backed. The vote was not for any ruling party. Just forget it.Meanwhile, still lying steaming on the Commons floor are three monster turds, all with a 31 October sell-by date. One is a Brexit crash-out no deal. Another is a second referendum, possibly revoking Brexit. A third, stinking to high heaven, is Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement.In the absence of any action, crashing out is now the legal default position. Even as a life-long Eurosceptic, I have seen nothing suggesting this would be remotely in the nation’s interest. The idea that crashing out “on WTO terms” will somehow win centrists or moderate Tories back to the fold is absurd. It would split the party in parliament and alienate a centre ground already toxic for Tories. Renegotiation is impossible, as there is no Brussels to negotiate with until the autumn, let alone one with the will to budge.On the other hand a revocation referendum would be near impossible to get through parliament against a Tory government veto – short of some sort of Commons putsch. It would probably require a no-confidence vote and an election, which was hardly takes matters forward. A referendum, to be of any value, would be after, not before, a deal. This leaves May’s agreement. It is still on the table. It was never a final, only a transitional deal, but it was composed from the most rare and febrile Westminster substance, cross-party compromise. Remainers hated it as against their faith. Some Tories hated it because they were flat-earthers, others because they loathed May and wanted her job.What has changed is the certainty of a new Tory prime minister. May’s sole legacy to them was her deal. It offered the country a perfectly honourable way forward out of the EU and into a new relationship with Europe. Any fool could pick holes in it, but it was a compromise agreed by Brussels, and would see us out before the 31 October deadline.A new Tory leader can only start from there. Towering ahead is one of the greatest peacetime tasks to face any British leader, to pull a shattered parliament back from the brink. It means swallowing all bombast and pride and taking forward a compromise based on May’s deal. There is no alternative.• Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",The EU election changes nothing.

10587,"Now that Theresa May has announced her resignation date, what happens next?Initially nothing. She will remain in post to bear the burden of the European election results, which will be announced on Sunday night and are widely expected to be grim for the Tory party.She will also greet Donald Trump when he visits and stand alongside the US president and other world leaders for the D-day commemorations in Portsmouth on 5 June.The jostling among potential successors that has already been going on for weeks will intensify dramatically. The contest officially begins on 10 June, when candidates will be asked to declare themselves formally. MPs will then whittle them down in a series of votes by the end of June, leaving party members to make the final choice.The party is aiming for the process to be complete by mid-July, in time for a new prime minister to take over before parliament’s summer break.What does May’s departure mean for Brexit?The main reason for the relatively quickfire contest is to give the new leader time to put a new cabinet in place and set out their stall on Brexit. Britain’s deadline for leaving the EU is 31 October, which leaves little time for discussions with EU27 leaders.Brexit is likely to dominate the leadership contest. Candidates will have to compete to show their stance is tough enough to impress the leave-leaning Conservative membership and see off the threat from Nigel Farage’s Brexit party.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner, has already said Britain must leave the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal, but he risks being outflanked on the right by Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary.The European Research Group’s Steve Baker, who voted against May’s withdrawal agreement all three times, unlike Johnson and Raab, has also said he is considering standing.Are we on the road to no deal?It certainly looks a lot more likely than it did at the start of the week. Champions of Johnson and Raab hope they might convince the EU27 to offer a much looser relationship, based around a Canada-style free-trade deal and, crucially, to ditch the backstop.Failing that, they could try to take Britain out without a deal. There has not been a majority for that approach in parliament, but the hard Brexiters believe a strong showing by Farage’s party will shift the balance. Certainly, backbenchers who masterminded the last parliamentary manoeuvres to block no deal, including Nick Boles and Yvette Cooper, doubt whether they would be able to do so again.If parliament did move against no deal, the new leader could call a general election, or even a referendum, in a bid to win a strong public mandate.Is Theresa May’s deal dead?Not completely. Much of the exit deal she negotiated, on issues such as citizens’ rights, the divorce bill and access to EU institutions, is likely to remain in place whatever comes next.She could even try to hold votes on some of its less contentious elements in her remaining few weeks in office, so that at least some of the legislative groundwork for leaving on time on 31 October is done.Many Brexiters, however, are determined to kill the backstop. May always insisted it simply formalised the UK’s obligations to protect the open border in Northern Ireland, but Johnson and others fear it will become the basis of the future trading relationship.The “Chequers deal”, May’s painstaking attempt to marry the needs of Britain’s economy with her Brexit red lines, looks like ancient history, though some observers believe Johnson might soften on Brexit somewhat once the leadership election is out of the way.Could Brexit still be stopped?Yes. A general election could return a Labour, or Labour-led government, but if Jeremy Corbyn’s party entered a coalition with the anti-Brexit Scottish National party or Liberal Democrats, it would come under intense pressure to call another Brexit referendum.With parliamentary and public debate becoming ever more polarised, there is also a growing chorus of calls for article 50 simply to be revoked. That looks impossible in the current parliament, but some ministers believe MPs would prefer it to no deal and a general election could change the complexion of the Commons dramatically – or, of course, leave it all but unchanged.","Deal or no deal: what next for Brexit, the Tories and the country?",2019-05-24/17:00:00,now that theresa may has announced her resignation date what happens next initially nothing she will remain in post to bear the burden of the european election results which will be announced on sunday night and are widely expected to be grim for the tory party she will also greet donald trump when he visits and stand alongside the us president and other world leaders for the d day commemorations in portsmouth on  june the jostling among potential successors that has already been going on for weeks will intensify dramatically the contest officially begins on  june when candidates will be asked to declare themselves formally mps will then whittle them down in a series of votes by the end of june leaving party members to make the final choice the party is aiming for the process to be complete by mid july in time for a new prime minister to take over before parliament s summer break what does may s departure mean for brexit the main reason for the relatively quickfire contest is to give the new leader time to put a new cabinet in place and set out their stall on brexit britain s deadline for leaving the eu is  october which leaves little time for discussions with eu leaders brexit is likely to dominate the leadership contest candidates will have to compete to show their stance is tough enough to impress the leave leaning conservative membership and see off the threat from nigel farage s brexit party boris johnson the frontrunner has already said britain must leave the eu on  october deal or no deal but he risks being outflanked on the right by dominic raab the former brexit secretary the european research group s steve baker who voted against may s withdrawal agreement all three times unlike johnson and raab has also said he is considering standing are we on the road to no deal it certainly looks a lot more likely than it did at the start of the week champions of johnson and raab hope they might convince the eu to offer a much looser relationship based around a canada style free trade deal and crucially to ditch the backstop failing that they could try to take britain out without a deal there has not been a majority for that approach in parliament but the hard brexiters believe a strong showing by farage s party will shift the balance certainly backbenchers who masterminded the last parliamentary manoeuvres to block no deal including nick boles and yvette cooper doubt whether they would be able to do so again if parliament did move against no deal the new leader could call a general election or even a referendum in a bid to win a strong public mandate is theresa may s deal dead not completely much of the exit deal she negotiated on issues such as citizens rights the divorce bill and access to eu institutions is likely to remain in place whatever comes next she could even try to hold votes on some of its less contentious elements in her remaining few weeks in office so that at least some of the legislative groundwork for leaving on time on  october is done many brexiters however are determined to kill the backstop may always insisted it simply formalised the uk s obligations to protect the open border in northern ireland but johnson and others fear it will become the basis of the future trading relationship the chequers deal may s painstaking attempt to marry the needs of britain s economy with her brexit red lines looks like ancient history though some observers believe johnson might soften on brexit somewhat once the leadership election is out of the way could brexit still be stopped yes a general election could return a labour or labour led government but if jeremy corbyn s party entered a coalition with the anti brexit scottish national party or liberal democrats it would come under intense pressure to call another brexit referendum with parliamentary and public debate becoming ever more polarised there is also a growing chorus of calls for article  simply to be revoked that looks impossible in the current parliament but some ministers believe mps would prefer it to no deal and a general election could change the complexion of the commons dramatically or of course leave it all but unchanged ,Brexit,0.295957804
10675,"After the 2017 general election, when Theresa May’s majority evaporated, George Osborne – the chancellor whom she had brutally sacked – described her as a “dead woman walking”.In some ways, the miracle is how a prime minister, with something of a reverse Midas touch when it comes to politics, has kept walking for nearly two years since then. But with just days left of her prime-ministership, she was determined to outline one last big, bold offer on Brexit. Ignoring the requests of advisers and ministers to wait until after tomorrow’s European elections, she pressed ahead with a major speech.The speech had a serious argument. There’s a lot in it with which it is hard to disagree, including her admission that Brexit was more complicated than many had claimed, and would require compromise. Quite. The problem is that the prime minister herself had spent quite some time in office implying that everything was rather binary because Brexit just meant Brexit. Indeed, it was her early actions in office – for example, her stubborn refusal to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK – that helped exacerbate the divisions of the referendum.Discussing the substance of yesterday’s speech is beside the point. The problem was the messenger, not the messageThere was a powerful logic to much of what May argued. But the speech stuck in the craw of many, especially the implication that the government would not just allow a vote on, but also would implement, a second referendum on Brexit.From my perspective, a further referendum in the absence of a clear electoral mandate for one would be a democratic outrage. I believe it would only further deepen divisions in this country over Brexit, would compound problems in Europe, and would give the SNP carte blanche to demand a rerun in Scotland. But I recognise that if a determined majority of MPs insist on one, it would politically be pretty much impossible to avoid without dissolving parliament. What the prime minister should have said yesterday was that there was no way she personally would ever lead a government to one.But discussing the substance of yesterday’s speech is somewhat beside the point. The problem was more about the messenger than the message. Many Conservative MPs are just not willing to listen to arguments from a party leader who they think has betrayed them. It’s hard to find a single Tory backbencher who thinks there’s any real way forward for the prime minister. Eurosceptic MPs who literally offered to build statues to honour her now publicly demand her resignation.Of course, the prime minister was not actually expecting to win the support of the remaining Conservative rebels. Although 90% of Tory MPs backed her Brexit deal on 29 March, including every single cabinet minister who resigned over Brexit, 34 Conservative MPs refused to do so. It seemed nigh on impossible to persuade 30 of them to switch position, which would allow her deal to pass. So, as one senior Downing Street figure put it to me, they were putting themselves “entirely” in “Labour’s hands”.Labour isn’t listening. Although we tend to focus on the Conservatives’ political crisis, Labour itself is bitterly split. John McDonnell wants a deal to cauterise the Brexit problem, whereas Keir Starmer and the powerful chief whip, Nick Brown, back a new referendum. Jeremy Corbyn isn’t powerful enough to move in either direction and so keeps sitting on the fence. Meanwhile, Labour haemorrhages votes to the Brexit party in one direction, and the Lib Dems in another.Although the prime minister’s speech included offers to various groups within parliament (including the bloc of Labour MPs opposed to a second referendum), none believe she has the political patronage or durability to cash the cheques she wrote just yesterday. As her credit dries up, there’s no incentive for any group to move to support this deal. It’s hard to see this as anything other than the endgame for her prime-ministership.Since the speech yesterday, a series of previously loyal Conservative MPs have declared against her Brexit plan. Support for her deal is going backwards. The withdrawal agreement bill (Wab)has not even been published yet, but barring a big change of position from a major group of MPs, it would be irresponsible to bring it forward. At this stage there seems zero prospect of a majority at second reading.A Conservative leadership contest is now imminent, with Brexit a running sore. With well over a dozen possible candidates, events could move extremely rapidly. At the core will be the question of how to find a Brexit policy that can succeed in this parliament where this prime minister has so spectacularly failed.Expect unicorn-chasing, a potential race to the bottom, and simple answers to complex problems. It is often repeated that all political careers end in failure, unless politicians leave on their own terms.

10721,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, trying to make sense of the nonsensical since June 2016. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means podcast here.Theresa May pledged to give MPs another chance to vote on her Brexit deal in the week beginning 3 June after an hour-long meeting with Jeremy Corbyn at which the Labour leader raised concerns about her ability to deliver on a cross-party deal.The prime minister had said her promise held good with or without Labour’s backing, but it will have to be the latter, plainly, because – as long expected – talks between the two parties on a compromise Brexit plan promptly collapsed.Each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks, with May saying the sticking point had been Labour’s division over a second referendum and the opposition insisting the government had been unwilling to compromise.After Conservative backbenchers forced May to set a timetable for her departure in the first week of June, Labour noted that her imminent demise meant there was no guarantee any promises would be kept by a successor, such as Boris Johnson.The prime minister will, however, ask her cabinet to sign off a package of Brexit concessions this week as she gears up for one last bid to win over parliament with what she called a “new, bold offer to MPs across the House of Commons”, hoping the Tories’ forecast drubbing at the hands of the Brexit party will focus minds.With Labour also heading for a trouncing, Corbyn defended the party’s confusing bid for both leavers and remainers, while Channel 4 infuriated Nigel Farage by alleging the Brexit party leader had been funded to the tune of £450,000 after the referendum by insurance tycoon Arron Banks.May has committed to giving MPs a vote on her key piece of Brexit legislation, the withdrawal agreement bill, possibly incorporating some of the “progress” made in talks with Labour on issues including workers’ rights and environmental standards, in the first week of June.She is discussing with ministers whether to hold more indicative parliamentary votes before then, with the idea that whatever emerges also be included in the bill.

1204,"LONDON   - The Scottish government said on Thursday that the imposition of U.S. tariffs on various goods including Scottish whisky indicated that the United Kingdom could not offset the damage from Brexit by striking a trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. “When Scotland’s food and drink businesses are facing the potential impact of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, the last thing they need is the further uncertainty of increased tariffs on exports to U.S.,” a Scottish government spokesman said. “The imposition of these tariffs also seriously undermines suggestions by the UK government that a potential free trade deal with the United States could easily or quickly offset the damage done by Brexit,” the spokesman said. The United States is the largest export market for Scotch Whisky, Scotland said. The United States on Wednesday said it would slap 10% tariffs on European-made Airbus (AIR.PA) planes and 25% duties on French wine, Scotch whiskies, and cheese from across the continent as punishment for illegal EU aircraft subsidies. “While this news is deeply concerning for Scotch Whisky and other Scottish products exported to the U.S., we still hope that Scottish exports will not become collateral damage in this trade dispute and support the EU’s ongoing work towards a negotiated settlement with the U.S.,” the spokesman said. “We have made our concerns about the impact on whisky and other Scottish produce clear to UK ministers, and expect them to do all they can to protect Scottish exports,” he said.  “We will continue to work with key partners, including the Scotch Whisky Association, to support the industry and minimize potential tariffs.” ",Scotland says U.S. tariff move shows UK's Brexit pipe dream,"October 3, 2019 /  11:59 AM ",london the scottish government said on thursday that the imposition of u s tariffs on various goods including scottish whisky indicated that the united kingdom could not offset the damage from brexit by striking a trade deal with u s president donald trump when scotland s food and drink businesses are facing the potential impact of a no deal brexit the last thing they need is the further uncertainty of increased tariffs on exports to u s a scottish government spokesman said the imposition of these tariffs also seriously undermines suggestions by the uk government that a potential free trade deal with the united states could easily or quickly offset the damage done by brexit the spokesman said the united states is the largest export market for scotch whisky scotland said the united states on wednesday said it would slap  tariffs on european made airbus air pa planes and  duties on french wine scotch whiskies and cheese from across the continent as punishment for illegal eu aircraft subsidies while this news is deeply concerning for scotch whisky and other scottish products exported to the u s we still hope that scottish exports will not become collateral damage in this trade dispute and support the eu s ongoing work towards a negotiated settlement with the u s the spokesman said we have made our concerns about the impact on whisky and other scottish produce clear to uk ministers and expect them to do all they can to protect scottish exports he said we will continue to work with key partners including the scotch whisky association to support the industry and minimize potential tariffs ,Brexit,0.21344839
3280,"  - The U.S. economy is in a “favorable place” and the Federal Reserve will “act as appropriate” to keep the current economic expansion on track, Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Friday in remarks that gave few clues about whether the central bank will cut interest rates at its next meeting or not. Story:		 * Powell says U.S. economy is in a ‘favorable place,’ Fed will ‘act as appropriate’ * Powell says Fed is working to sustain economy that faces ‘significant risks’   * Powell says U.S. economy is close to both of Fed’s goals * Powell says slowing global growth, trade policy uncertainty, muted inflation weigh on favorable outlook * Powell says premise that healthy U.S. economy needed higher rates was generally borne out * Powell says low inflation, not high inflation, is ‘problem of this era’ STOCKS: S&P 500 .SPX slightly pares loss, last down 0.33% BONDS: U.S. Treasury yields slipped; 2s US2YT=RR at 1.5682%; 10s US10YT=RR at 1.5774%; 2s/10s curve now flatter around 0.8 bps FOREX: The U.S. dollar index .DXY pares slight gains, last off 0.1% MINH TRANG, SENIOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADER, SILICON VALLEY BANK, SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA     “I don’t think there were any surprises. It’s consistent with the sentiment that you saw in the minutes.      “Powell’s comments basically reiterate a lot of what we have been discussing. That the economy is doing relatively well overall, but there are a lot of challenges and headwinds that are coming our way potentially. I think you could read that in the minutes of the last meeting. The rate cut was more or less an insurance cut to kind of forestall some of these potentially significant headwinds even though the economy is overall doing pretty solid.      “There is a disconnect between the expectations of the market and what the messaging from the Fed is. They haven’t really been in sync for a while now.”  NELA RICHARDSON, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, EDWARD JONES, ST. LOUIS “Markets might confuse chair Powell’s comments of today with Draghi’s comments of a few years ago and misinterpret ‘act as appropriate’ with ‘do whatever it takes’. And that’s the risk.” “What I’ve read of the Powell speech has laid out a very dovish framework that may not be met, given what we are seeing in the economy, slight increases in inflation, stronger retail sales. The recent data, except for the manufacturing, don’t really support a strong, aggressive, do-whatever-it-takes monetary stance and yet that’s exactly what the markets are pricing in right now.” GENNADIY GOLDBERG, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK “Powell’s kind of sticking to the tone. It sounds very much like the minutes, he’s presenting the same arguments, he’s speaking for the committee rather than just for himself, it sounds like, and not committing. The one interesting point is he did talk about all the risks that have happened since the July meeting, and that suggests that he is allowing the markets to price in a September move. That’s where the ‘act as appropriate’ language comes in. That tells us that a September cut is probably a go, not that the market was uncertain to begin with. The kind of disappointing part here is that Powell did not commit to easing rates further, given these global uncertainties. So they are going to be taking these cuts one at a time, rather than providing any kind of forward guidance.” RICHARD FRANULOVICH, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, WESTPAC, NEW YORK    “The headlines seem consistent with a central banker attentive to the risk and prepared to do more to support the expansion and do whatever it takes to underwrite a continuing recovery. I don’t think that’s particularly new or innovative.  That’s what Powell has been saying for some time.  And the reaction in the FX market is pretty muted.      “I don’t really know what the market was thinking would be delivered, but if you’re betting on another two or three cuts, you wouldn’t be dissuaded by this speech based on the headlines. It doesn’t look like he has leapfrogged expectations. I guess he’s cementing an easing bias and he’s prepared to do more as needed.” SEAN SIMKO, HEAD OF GLOBAL INCOME MANAGEMENT, SEI INVESTMENTS, OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA “The markets are not reacting too much right now. The message he is providing is that we will be vigilant and are watching everything that’s developing. The question is whether the market will be comfortable with them, to wait for them to assess the data points and then make judgments whether the rates need to be lower. The economy is growing but we are seeing some slowdown. He hasn’t taken the opportunity to remove expectations about a rate cut next month. The size of the next cut will depend on how the data come out and how the global economy evolves in the next couple of weeks. The message is that they really want to keep this economy going.  “The yield curve is saying the Fed is not doing enough, they are behind the curve. They want the Fed to do 50 basis points. We continue to favor duration. With any backup in yields, we are looking to add exposure. That wall of worries will help flows into U.S. Treasuries. That will keep the 10-year yield in this 1.50-1.75% range, maybe even lower especially if any of those worries on the economy, trade and Brexit intensify.” ",Powell: Fed to act as appropriate to keep

3980,"LONDON   - Goldman Sachs said it no longer expects the United States and China to agree on a deal to end their prolonged trade dispute before the November 2020 presidential election as policymakers from the world’s largest economies are “taking a harder line”. The bank now expects two back-to-back rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) “in light of growing trade policy risks, market expectations for much deeper rate cuts, and an increase in global risk related to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit”. The comment on U.S.-China trade and a revision to Fed expectations came after U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he would impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, further aggravating trade tensions with Beijing. The move by Washington “suggests that both sides in the trade conflict are taking a harder line, reducing the odds of a resolution in the near term,” Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note. Hatzius said expects the new set of tariffs to remain in place on election day in November. Global equities have lost nearly $2.5 trillion on the tough rhetoric from both the United States and China. On Monday, China let the yuan slide in response to the latest U.S. tariffs. Hatzius sees a 75% chance of a rate cut by the Fed in September and a 50% chance in October, following the reduction last week. He had previously only expected two cuts this year. “The Fed has been increasingly responsive this year to trade war threats, bond market expectations, and global growth concerns,” Hatzius added.

8936,"LONDON   - Britain is starting its search for a new governor of the Bank of England to succeed Mark Carney who is due to step down in January 2020. Carney has twice extended his term in charge of the British central bank in order to help guide the economy through Brexit. But he has ruled out a further delay even though Britain’s departure from the European Union remains up in the air. Finance minister Philip Hammond is hoping that concerns about Brexit will not deter potential applicants. Following is a summary of possible contenders to run the BoE which oversees the world’s fifth-biggest economy and Britain’s huge finance industry.  A former deputy BoE governor, Bailey was tipped by analysts as Carney’s most likely successor. But the delays to the search for the next BoE governor has raised questions about whether finance minister Philip Hammond sees him as the best candidate. Bailey reached the role of deputy governor at the BoE with a focus on banks before becoming chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, a financial markets regulator. In his time at the BoE, Bailey helped to steer Britain’s banks through the global financial crisis, enhancing his reputation as a safe pair of hands. But heading the FCA is fraught with risks. Lawmakers in parliament’s Treasury Committee criticized Bailey for not publishing all of a report into alleged misconduct by bank RBS. Bailey has cited privacy restrictions. As FCA boss, Bailey sits on important panels at the BoE that oversee banks. Although he has never been interest-rate setter, he once ran the BoE international economic analysis team. Broadbent and Ramsden are deputy governors for monetary policy and for markets and banking respectively. Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist who trained as a classical pianist, is respected for his economic analysis but has less experience on banking oversight. Ramsden was the Treasury’s chief economic advisor before joining the BoE. The two other BoE deputy governors, Jon Cunliffe and Sam Woods, are less likely contenders. Woods focuses mostly on financial regulation while Cunliffe - a former British ambassador to the European Union - would be aged 66 at the start of the term which usually runs for eight years. The BoE’s chief economist, Haldane has developed a reputation for floating unconventional ideas, including the possibility that music apps such as Spotify and multiplayer online games might give central bankers just as a good a sense of what is going on in the economy as traditional surveys. In 2012, he praised the anti-capitalist Occupy movement for suggesting new ways to fix the shortcomings of global finance. Haldane has experience of both sides of the BoE, having served as executive director for financial stability, overseeing the risks to the economy from the banking system. But he might be seen as too much of a maverick to take the job of governor. The announcement of Carney, the first non-British governor of the BoE in more than three centuries, was a surprise.  But his tenure has been seen as a success for financial diplomacy, and the government is keen to promote what it calls a “global Britain” after the country leaves the European Union. Rajan, 56, was governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 2013 to 2016, and chief economist at the International Monetary Fund between 2003 and 2006, when he warned that financial innovation could trigger a crisis.     Now a finance professor at Chicago Booth business school, Rajan has just published a book on populist dissatisfaction with markets and the state - touching on some of the underlying issues that drove the Brexit vote in 2016. Rajan unexpectedly did not seek a renewal of his three-year term at the RBI, having faced hostility from some sections of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP party who disliked his less nationalist stance and brief forays into political territory. Rajan declined to comment when asked by Reuters last week whether he would consider a return to active policymaking.  The prospect of the left-wing Labour Party taking power has grown as Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to break the Brexit impasse in parliament. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his would-be finance minister John McDonnell are socialists and have in the past proposed that the BoE should fund investment in infrastructure, a big change from its current focus on inflation.  Former members of Labour’s economic advisory committee included U.S. academic and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz and Ann Pettifor, a British economist who is an austerity critic and former BoE rate-setter David Blanchflower.

9361,"AMSTERDAM   - More than 40 licenses were issued in 2018 to businesses moving to Amsterdam from London due to Britain’s departure from the European Union, the Dutch financial markets regulator said on Thursday. In its 2018 annual report the AFM said it had held discussions with 150 companies and expects 30 to 40 percent of the European stock and bond market to move to the Netherlands in the event of Brexit.

9922,"LONDON   - Britain is wrecking its reputation for business stability with political divisions over Brexit and risks leaving the trading bloc with a hugely damaging “no-deal”, the UK head of German industrial giant Siemens has said.  After Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal was rejected by parliament for a third time last week there is pressure from rival factions for a no-deal exit, a much softer divorce or an election. “Where the UK used to be beacon for stability, we are now becoming a laughing stock,” Juergen Maier said in open letter to lawmakers published by website Politico.  “It has been clear for weeks, that the only way that this will be resolved is through compromise between the government and parliament,” Maier said, calling for a softer Brexit. Maier said it was becoming hard for him to win support from his board for investment decisions as Britain heads towards a “hugely damaging no-deal Brexit.” “Enough is enough. We are all running out of patience. Make a decision and unite around a customs union compromise that delivers economic security and stability,” he said.     In year to September 2018, Siemens UK generated revenue of 5 billion pounds, the company’s website said. At the end of September 2018, the company had 15,000 employees in Britain.
