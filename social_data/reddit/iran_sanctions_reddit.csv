I've read the article. And I still have no idea what sanctions are being implemented.
Poor Saudi Arabia you can’t even commit a large scale genocide in Yemen without triggering attacks on you.
"Without any proof Iran was involved..gee, no agenda here.."
"The same people that manufactured, on command, proof or Iraqi WMDs, are presenting proof of Iranian aggression.  Trump believes that a shooting war is his best chance of holding on to the throne in 2020."
"Oh, there is coming back from this stupidity."
Oof
These are remakes of old sanctions. It's a trend in US.
Another article here says they affected food and medicine availability though medicines were also impacted by the previous sanctions so it seems to be an intensification
You hit the nail on the head.
Well we have to do SOMETHING to distract the masses
"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/19/762065119/what-we-know-about-the-attack-on-saudi-oil-facilities

There's plenty of evidence that the Houthis weren't behind it; even distinctly anti-Trump sources like NPR have put together the dots that the rebel claim fundamentally lacks credibility, and other countries are recognizing that as well.  France specifically did yesterday.

You can stick your head in the sand all you like, but on balance of probabilities, it's very likely Iran did this."
[There's a mountain load of evidence Iran is behind it.]( https://shadowbreakintl.com/uploaded/aramco_report_19092019.pdf ) And that's not even getting into the fact that the ones who claimed responsibility are Iranian proxies in the first place.
"Sanctions, by their nature, are done to fulfill an agenda.  Are you arguing that sanctions should be enacted randomly on random countries, for no purpose, or agenda?"
"He reheats leftover sanctions.

Hopefully he doesn't leave them in there too long. They get chewy."
Effective for distraction..
You don't seem very distracted and most people never gave a fuck.
"> You can stick your head in the sand all you like, but on balance of probabilities, it's very likely Iran did this.

Right. First, you would choose to believe this 'information' referenced as fact, yet if you really look at the reported ""evidence"", there are far more questions than answers.

*Especially*, considering all the parties involved (and potentially), and the questionable evidence presented, one rule of thumb is ""don't believe anyone"". They're all liars until absolute fact can be established.

How is it that in so many other 'global-class' events, investigation for the facts takes months, if not years, yet we're ""concluded"" about who did what so fast the smoke hasn't cleared from the scene of attack?


DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING UNTIL PROVEN.


>it's very likely Iran did this.


You could be right...but what if you're wrong, and at the cost of how many lives?


Measure twice and cut once."
It's going to be whoever the US wants it to be. Same way Iraq had WMDs. That they even try to create a PR campaign to drum up support of war is a nice enough gesture instead of just doing whatever the hell they want with our tax dollars in the middle east without informing us.
"So let's pretend Iran at least gave aid to the Houthis.  Fine.

Why do we care that Mr. Bone Saw's refinery got bombed?  He has an army.  He's the one fighting the war in Yemen.  Let him deal with it."
"Correction: There's a mountain of stories presented as facts.

I'll wait for satisfactory evidence to support the stories."
"I don't respond to ""leading"" questions."
"No. He's saying that it's obvious the Trump administration is looking for any excuse to increase tensions with Iran, so much so that they are sanctioning them because they blame them for an attack that there is no proof they did.

Quit your bullshit of arguing with the semantics of someone sentence and drawing attention away from the main point they're making."
"They’re arguing that they should be used as punishment. 

That’s pretty obvious."
It was a joke.
Ah the voice of reason so seldom heard when it comes to these issues. Thank you stranger!
"""We need to invade Iraq because they definitely have weapons of mass destruction!""

History seems to be repeating itself."
Photo's of remains of cruise missiles matching Iranian displayed ones are stories and not hard facts? Alright there bud let's just stop pretending that any form of evidence will ever satisfy you.
"Alright.  Why did you say ""no agenda here..""?"
"I'd say they're not trying to increase tensions.  If they wanted to increase tensions, they could have done a strategic strike on Iran at any point in the last few weeks.  If anything, Trump is trying to DE escalate, because it's a very politically unpopular war... especially among Trump's political base.  Trump voters voted for him to stop the wars in the middle east... not to start them.

In fact, the only reason Trump didn't strike Iran, is likely because he's selfish, and didn't want to face the political blow-back of further escalating tensions with Iran."
"I'd say the obvious agenda is to weaken Iran.  They've been saying it publicly for months.  The guy said ""no agenda here"" sarcastically, as if there was a hidden agenda."
More of a comment really.
"Seemingly, even less so on reddit.."
"Reliable, if not predictable."
"So Iran launches more than 10 cruise missiles that nobody detected on radar and was able to pin point the exact location of Saudi production to knock out 10% of the oil the worlds oil production.....


The entire 5th fleet is in Bahrain there is billions of dollars worth of air defense and none of it saw anything and oil goes up by 20%."
"Maybe if you had any aviation and/or weapons background, you would know to look at actual components, understand what they are, what they do, how they react in close proximity (warhead) detonations, fragmenting, field of debris, burn marks, etc..


You look at these photos as fact, yet you haven't a clue the origin of the photos?


You see parts, some heavy parts, scattered around, yet there are no impact craters..anywhere?


Sure. Fact. Evidence. Case closed. Let's go bomb Iran."
"Having the ability to absorb, disseminate and process information at face value is a useful asset."
It was pretty obvious sarcasm.
"Im pretty sure he is implying that the agenda is in the interest of the Saudis, not the US. He literally tweeted he was waiting for MBSs plan."
"De-escalating the situation by sanctioning Iran without any proof they were involved? 

Right."
"A strategic strike isn't escalating it's a borderline declaration of war unless you don't mean military, then sanctions are really the only option."
Is there any hope at all? I myself doubt it :(
">pin point the exact location of Saudi production

The exact location was *never* a secret. And yes cruise missile defense is fucking hard. A cruise missile traveling at an altitude of 30 meters needs to be within ~30km of a radar that's located 10m above ground in order to be spotted."
"He doesn't have to have the background in forensics,  the people who prepare these reports have that background and they are the ones saying they match. He is just presenting those findings to you. 

Also as for a lack of impact craters or anything like that. If you had read you would know that the pictures are from cruise missiles/drones that went down early or did not reach their targets."
"Yup.  I've already said that in another post responding to this chain.  

But, he's acting like there's a hidden agenda.  Everyone knows the agenda is to weaken Iran.  Trump has said his.  His cabinet have said it.  Liberals know it.  Conservatives know it.  So, why is he using sarcasm that implies a covert agenda?"
"Yes, because it's going to be a Saudi led initiative, because it's a Saudi problem.  The USA will help, because it's in our interest, but we're not going to lose more troops than the Saudis defending their own nation.

If the UK got invaded... we'd be doing the same thing.  We'd be working with the UK, asking what they wanted to do for their national defense.

Same thing happened after 9/11... people were willing to help with America's plan, and follow their lead, because it was an attack on America.  Obviously Germany/France weren't going to do stuff America disagreed with, considering it was America that got attacked."
"So, why didn't Trump strike Iran a few weeks ago?  What's your reason, if not that he was scared of it turning into a war?

Why was Trump saying he was willing to meet with Iranian leaders?

The goal is to keep pressure on Iran high, so that it makes a mistake, and gets the world pissed off at it.  And, the plan seems to be working.  The plan is not to escalate tensions and start a war.  If that happens, Trump's policies failed(unless it's an international war against Iran)."
"Is there hope? I'd like to think so..


Likelihood? Not no, but hell no."
"The exact location to disable the entire facility should’ve been secret.




So Iran now has cruise missiles that can strike with pin point accuracy 1000 miles away and can’t be detected by USA radar. Bull fucking shit."
"> Also as for a lack of impact craters or anything like that. If you had read you would know that the pictures are from cruise missiles/drones that went down early or did not reach their targets.

So, if a missile/drone/aircraft crashes off target, it doesn't make a mark on the ground where it hit?


^Interesting.."
"Where is the evidence that Iran coordinated these attacks? Its literally hearsay *from a dictator*. This administration has clear ties to Saudi Arabia and orchestrated the Khashoggi murder Trump helped cover it up. 

Funny that you mention 9/11. Who was responsible for that again?"
"Much bigger step than sanctions. 
Testing the water maybe."
">Funny that you mention 9/11. Who was responsible for that again?

If you believe the official US story, Osama Bin Laden was responsible.  And he attacked the USA, and was exiled from Saudi Arabia, because he was against Saudi Arabia letting the USA build military bases on the Arabian Peninsula.  Because OBL hated the Saudi Government, And America so much, his family(and the Saudi Government) disowned him.  

And, it's a matter of common knowledge that the Iranians fund the Houthis.  The Houthis wouldn't do the biggest attack in their history, without Iran's permission.

What I don't get about your conspiracy theory is... why would the Saudis want to attack America?  And why would America blame it on other people?"
what?
Bombing someone is a much bigger step than sanctions. . . . .
"Yup.  And Iran already blew up a US drone, attacked tankers, hijacked tankers, and directly or indirectly bombed 5% of the world's global oil production.  I agree... sanctions are MUCH less serious than bombing.  And, Iran has escalated far past what the USA has.  USA is trying to keep from war, and keep crippling sanctions on Iran.  Iran is trying to get the sanctions off by using military force/bombs."
"Not defending Iran, but the USA is hardly trustworthy now. Wouldn’t be surprised if the Saudis were pulling the strings. 

Iran states it was in their airspace, they’re entitled to shoot it down. 

USA stated it wasn’t.

Why would Iran play nice when trump has shat on the floor of their house? Constantly threatening them and accusing them of things with little to no proof. 

Didn’t this all stem from trump applying sanctions and scrapping the previous agreement with them even though they were abiding by it. 

They’ll just wait for trump to leave office."
"I'm not saying what Iran should or shouldn't do.  Or which side is ""right"".  I'm simply stating that the USA isn't trying to escalate, or trying to find reasons to go to war.  It already has enough reasons to strike Iran.

Iran is interested in ratcheting tensions, to make Europe/USA change their policies of sanctioning Iran.  The USA is interested in maintaining a status quo, where Iran is heavily sanctioned and getting weaker by the day.

I, personally don't blame the USA, or Iran for doing what they think is best to help themselves... it's what every person and nation on earth does pretty much."
"They don’t have enough reasons though. 

If the USA was interested in the status quo Trump wouldn’t have come in throwing sanctions left and right and trying to change deals that were already agreed upon just because they were signed under Obama."
"Trump/Israel/Saudis became interested in keeping the status quo, once they implemented sanctions.  Let me be clear.

Trump/Israel/Saudis weren't satisfied with the Iran Deal, because Iran was using the funds to wage proxy wars in Syria/Yemen/Iraq against Saudi/Israeli/American interests.  So, Israel/Saudis supported Trump, and helped him get elected.

Once Trump changed the status quo to Iran being Crippled by Sanctions... The Saudis/Israelis/Trump became satisfied with the Status Quo that currently exists.  War is not something the Saudis/Israelis/USA are interested in, because it gives Iran a chance to change the status quo in their favor.

Similarly, Iran was satisfied with the Status Quo of the Iran deal.  Once Trump got rid of the deal, and instituted Sanctions, Iran stopped being okay with the Status Quo.

So, now the USA/Saudis/Israel are satisfied with the way things are.  As long as Iran can't draw them into a war, Iran will slowly be strangled, and become less and less powerful(which will turn the tides of the whole middle east).  

Iran, knowing this, is doing ANYTHING IT CAN to change the status quo.  Because Europe wouldn't capitulate to Iran's demands of giving them a better deal, to make up for the USA leaving the deal... Iran has no diplomatic options, besides coming back to the table, and taking a worse deal.  Iran isn't willing to do that.  So, the only card Iran still has up its sleeve is to start blowing stuff up, to either force the USA into a war, and beat them, or, scare USA/Europe into realizing that a war with Iran will mean tens of millions of Europeans/Americans/Saudis/Israelis killed."
It seems Trump wants to force their hand. It's like he's pushing for military conflict.
So now it's double-secret probation for Iran.
since the U.S provides arms and ammunition to Saudi Arabia aren't they behind the Yemen crisis? Jesus Christ i'm beyond embarrassed at what the govt. over there is doing to people in the name of money

"Way to stop the violence, sanction a country that did nothing but possibly supply some tech to the people being murdered in there hundreds of thousands in Yemen."
Still no Russian sanctions....
What should the response be?
"USA: We don't want to do business with Iran, or anyone that does business with Iran.

/u/Bully4u: They want war.

"They US may be behind the escalation of the Yemen crisis, but the crisis was there long before Saudi Arabia's intervention:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_(2015%E2%80%93present)

On the other hand, the US was involved in the Yemeni Civil War long before Saudi Arabia's intervention:

He's a master negotiator. Negotiate a peace.
"The U.S. pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal last year. It looks like the U.S. doesn't want sanctions so much as war between the Saudi's and Iran.
To answer your question, let the 2015 agreement stand."
"wow, its almost like the U.S has been keeping the Middle East in constant disarray for a very long time then...gosh I wonder why"
And you don't think the terms of that deal should have any consequences for Iran?
So you want to reward Iran for bombing Saudi Arabia?  Have you thought about what kind of message this would send to the world?
Do you know why the U.S. was in Yemen?
"What deal? The deal he's yet to broker?



You are asking me how the president in the future should respond to a hypothetical breach of a hypothetical deal?

The simple answer is ""in accordance with provisions of the accord."""
"We’re the only ones saying it’s Iran. Everyone else is saying it’s the Houthi Rebels. 

The Houthi even claimed responsibility. 

We tried to say the drone/mine attack on the tanker was Iran. Everyone said there was no proof, and refused to send ships. 

So what makes you think the administration is telling the truth now? When they’ve lied about so much before."
"for the same reason they are in Afghanistan, Iraq, syria...the list goes on"
">It seems Trump wants to force their hand. It's like he's pushing for military conflict.

This is the comment i'm responding to.  Clearly it's criticism for punishing Iran.

I'm simply asking if Iran should be punished or not.  And if not, why not?"
">The Houthi even claimed responsibility.

lol this is so irrelevant.  OF COURSE they're going to claim responsibility.  They're already at war with Saudi Arabia.  Terrorist organizations do this all the time.  ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko-haram.. etc, will claim responsibility for successful attacks to make them look stronger and boost moral for their movement.

And even IF they actually were the ones who carried out the attack, their weapons were clearly given to them by Iran.  Iran has been openly supporting them since the uprising in Yemen."
Can you be more specific?
"
You asked ""What should the response be?"" 

The response should be for Trump to exercise his master negotiating skills and barter an agreement that promotes peace in the region."
"> I'm simply asking if Iran should be punished or not.

As soon as SA is punished for murdering those kids on the bus."
"So by your logic here America is directly responsible for bombing school buses in Yemen killing children?

Not the Saudis but America because they supplied the weapons?

Im so tired of Americans hypocrisy."
do I really need to be?
"Okay, but that doesn't explain what best promotes peace in the region.  That very well could be increased sanctions on Iran, so I guess we are in agreement."
So.. that's a yes?
"??? When did I say I was okay with the United States supplying weapons to Saudi Arabia?  Please find the quote where I said that.  And when you don't find it, apologize."
"I'm just curious if you are actually educated about why we were in Yemen or you are just talking out of your ass.

The government of Yemen invited us in to help them fight Al-Qaeda.  Do you really consider that to be the U.S. wanting to ""keep the middle-east in disarray""?"
"> barter an agreement

If sanctions are part of an agreement being upheld by both sides, then yes, we agree."
He should be sanctioning SA not Iran.
"Sure, after SA."
">And even IF they actually were the ones who carried out the attack, their weapons were clearly given to them by Iran. Iran has been openly supporting them since the uprising in Yemen.


This says that Iran is responsible because they are the ones that supplied the Houthis with the weapons to do it.


Which would make the US responsible for killing kids on buses in Yemen by the same logic. 

That's the point Topher was making.


>??? When did I say I was okay with the United States supplying weapons to Saudi Arabia?

No one said that you said that.


>And when you don't find it, apologize.


lol





If you want to fight Iran, do it yourself. F your ""kingdom"""

"The only reason the US is in the middle east is oil. Once electric cars are the prime means of transport and oil is only being used for plastics and other goods, dropping consumption by 99%, only then will the US leave the middle east."

I know the point that he was making, and i'm not okay with the United State supplying weapons.

Knowingly giving weapons to murderers implicates you in that murder."
"Let me guess,  you're into ""Ancient Aliens""."
"I'm certainly not going to say that they were a great government, but preventing a government overthrow is probably the most stable thing that can be done.

That country is littered with terrorists, and now with this government transition happening, there is nobody to police them. You think this is what stable looks like?"
Do you have proof of this?
"Iran did not attack them, come back when you accept that and we can talk."
Just joining the conversation .....why would you believe ancient aliens had anything to do with the oil wars in the middle east?
"Saudia Arabia has more terrorists than any other country in the world, when things kick off there the country will suffer more than any other as there are so many targets that could shut down more than 70% of the countries wealth."
"The fact that the US committed to a war in Iraq(oil) when SA was the guilty partner in 9/11. The fact that America is only interested in causing trouble in countries with oil reserves in the middle east and South America.Oh as for Saudi Arabia , the US managed to become close friends with them but that is only so they can use there soil as  base of operations in the middle east and they are happy to share there wealth with specific groups in American politics."
"So when they calculated the flight path from the circuit boards, they were just lying?"
"because both are conspiratorial, unfounded views.  Generally people that have a certain characteristic of accepting claims on little evidence accept many claims on little evidence."
.... Which is why you wouldn't want the Saudi Arabian government to collapse.
"You don't make any sense at all.  Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.  Do you mean Afghanistan, or do you just have no idea what you're talking about?"
so the u.s being in the Middle East over resources and keeping the area in disarray by installing puppet governments is conspiracy? you are saying it is as likely as aliens? ok then
"Read better......you seem to ignore the comment i wrote and write a comment that make no sense to me, of course Iraq was not responsible for 9/11 everyone knows SA were responsible fully responsible."
">The fact that the US committed to a war in Iraq(oil) when SA was the guilty partner in 9/11.

This comment doesn't make sense.  It would make sense if it was ""Why did the US commit to a war in Afghanistan when SA was the guilty party in 9/11""

Your comment is like saying ""Why did the U.S. go to war in Korea when Japan was the one who attacked Hawaii?""  

The attack on pearl harbor and the Korean war were completely unrelated, just as 9/11 is completely unrelated to the Iraq war."

"Except that whole ""Build islands to artificiality extend borders"" while encroaching on other countries waterfronts.

"I mean it was never the most stable place for a majority of the last 2,000 years. The worlds battleground, there isn’t a people that haven’t seen some active service in the Mid East."
Then why are they forcing restrictions on time spent on the internet?
Taliban wanted to negotiate the release of Bin Laden.
">How blind you are to the truth

"There was still far more stability with Iran 3 years ago then there is now, and it's easy to identify what changed."
Because shit like reddit and twitter ain't healthy

Hypocrisy what the US is doing.
"That article doesn't argue against their call for evidence being seen as a delay tactic by the US. In addition to that, the Taliban also wanted the US to stop their bombing campaign, which would conveniently allow bin Laden a safer opportunity to escape.

Aside from that the Taliban still refused to get rid of Al Qaeda camps in the country and were still part of the Afghan Civil War in which they brutalized the country, they were in no position to make demands."
">Which could have been done through real democracy.

Real democracy didnt exist there at that time. They were brutal regimes oppressing any opposition, minorities or anyone who spoke out. Sadam had infamous death squads and his version of gulags... he not not harboured but supported Al-Qaeda...

Egypt? You mean that thing at the high of the Arab spring when the people protested agaisnt their leaders one year rule that fucked up their country bad, and the violent way he suppressed those protests which lead to a full on coup? Yeah, why wouldn't we support the side that just wants a stable economy instead of authoritarian rule..."
"Lmfao. I never said I thought China building islands to expand their territory is bad, I said that alot of chinese citizens are concerned by it.

>Jesus H Christ, how stupid do you have to be?

They were terrible leaders. Prove me wrong..."
Someone's in denial about China....
"Of course you know more than me. It was the military that killed people and has had authoritarian rule for decades, of course they would move aside like in Sudan peacefully"
">chinese citizens are concerned by it.

Citation needed.

Why would I? That doesn't mean anything."
Someone believes they are righteous above all
"Wait wait. Now that I'm reading into it and refreshing my memory, we didnt support the coup. We strictly stayed out of it. We stopped funding in 2011... and remained neutral as a country.

So you almost had me there with that bold claim, good thing I like to read..."
">Citation needed.

Well there is Wei Hui, her novel has been banned by the CCP for critisism and she has been quite outspoken in her time.

More recently, Tashi Wangchuk was arrested for speaking to the NYTimes being critical of the CCP.

  


There are literally decades more of examples if you want to continue.

"I'm among the first to critize America when we fuck up, I just find thar your argument is dishonest. You said China only does stuff in their country, I gave clear examples of that not being the case. You came back with ""nou"" ""hypocrite"" and ""whataboutism""...

"So when you say many, you actually mean 2? Gotcha. Not really the definition of many though is it, when the population of China is around 1.5 billion people.

"Lol. I gave two examples. Like I said, I could go on, there are decades of this happening multiple times a year, and thousands, if not millions of Chinese who speak out agaisnt the CCP...

  


>Suddam Hussein didn't declare war on the US. You're confused.

  


No, you're confused. I said Sadan supported people who declared war on the US, Al-Qaeda, since you didnt get the reference..."
Did you want a list of every person ever?
">I gave two examples

My point exactly. **Two**. You claim that many Chinese are concerned about China's Islands in the South China Sea. To represent this supposed ""many"" you've claimed a Tibetan author, and a Chinese author who as far as I know, hasn't said anything about the islands in the South China Sea.

Two isn't representative of many in *any* context. Its orders of magnitude less when you consider the population of China is 1.4 billion.

Show me the many you claim. 


>No, you're confused. I said Sadan supported people who declared war on the US, Al-Qaeda,

Wrong again. There were no links between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda:

>The consensus of intelligence experts has been that these contacts never led to an operational relationship, and that consensus is backed up by reports from the independent 9/11 Commission and by declassified Defense Department reports as well as by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, whose 2006 report of Phase II of its investigation into prewar intelligence reports concluded that there was **no evidence of ties between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda**.

[Source](
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein_and_al-Qaeda_link_allegations)

>The then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated in September 2004 that: ""I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN charter. From our point of view and the UN Charterpoint of view, it [the war] was illegal"", explicitly declaring that the US-led war on Iraq was illegal.

[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_the_Iraq_War) 

As I said earlier, illegal wars of aggression built on lies that resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead people and millions more displaced are orders of magnitude worse than building Islands in the South China Sea."
Is that what I asked?
">Two isn't representative of many in \*any\* context. Its orders of magnitude less when you consider the population of China is 1.4 billion.

  


I could talk all day about

  


 Rukiye Turdush, and many other Uyghur Chinese who have escaped The clutches of the CCP.

  


There were 65,000 protests agaisnt the CCP or their decisions in 2005 alone, and over 160,000 in 2010, estimated by the [Chinese Academy of Social Sciences](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Social_Sciences) themselves.

  


I dont have to name every single person, I've already proven that support for the CCP is less dogmatic then you claim.

  


  


No evidence of a direct link doesn't mean that they were still harbouring al-Qaeda in their borders without consequence as they conducted their operations there.

  


>As I said earlier, illegal wars of aggression built on lies that resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead people and millions more displaced are orders of magnitude worse than building Islands in the South China Sea.

And like I said, your whataboutisms dont change the fact that your initial lie that China doesn't do anythi g outside its borders is wrong. And oh, the UN saying a war is illegal because we didn't get their permission? We learned that one from the russians. As well, the UN also says that Chinas operations in the South China sea is illegal, so much for kot being a hypocrite...

  


  


Also, you dont know that, maybe Chinas pathetic attempt to claim the south China sea will also kill thousands and displace millions, of Chinese.

It's not going to happen."
"And if you examples of people who are against the CCP. Those ""reeducation"" camps are a good place to look. Maybe try Tibet, many are agaisnt them. Pretty much any ministry that doesn't surrender to the CCPs commands..."
"You're a liar. 

Let's examine what you claimed:

>I never said I thought China building islands to expand their territory is bad, I said that **alot of chinese citizens are concerned by it**.

So far you haven't managed to show that *any* Chinese citizens are concerned by it, let alone ""a lot"".

So please feel free to ""talk about it all day"". I want to see proof of ""a lot"" of Chinese concerned by islands in the South China Sea, as you claimed. 


>support for the CCP is less dogmatic then you claim.


Please quote where I've claimed this. 


 
>No evidence of a direct link doesn't mean that they were still harbouring al-Qaeda in their borders without consequence as they conducted their operations there.


It means there was no direct link, as concluded by intelligence agencies and various other commissions. If you are too thick to understand what that means, then that's on you. 

 

>the fact that your initial lie that China doesn't do anythi g outside its borders is wrong

Christ you are thick aren't you? Please quote where I claimed that. 


>And oh, the UN saying a war is illegal because we didn't get their permission?

By definition, yes."
"> And if you examples of people who are against the CCP

Except I'm not arguing that people don't protest the CCP. Protests happen in every country. So what the actual fuck are you even talking about?"
">So far you haven't managed to show that \*any\* Chinese citizens are concerned by it, let alone ""a lot"".

  


Lmfao. All the examples I gave are Chinese citizens. Aswell, the thousands of protests and all those reeducation camps are also Chinese citizens. If Taiwan and Hongkong are really apart of China, you will find to lack of hate agaisnt it there. From the protests in Hong kong agaisnt specifically the island issue, I think many show their feelings.

  


>Please quote where I've claimed this.

Oh sorry, that was the other guy who stopped replying after you started. Let me rephrase it, ""suppoer of the CCP is less dogmatic then WAS claimed.

  


>It means there was no direct link, as concluded by intelligence agencies and various other commissions. If you are too thick to understand what that means, then that's on you.

  


And what I'm saying is that they had a terrorist organization in their sovereignty who declared war on us and they did nothing about it. Yeah, after the flew two planes into our buildings we were not just going to sit back. It's clear that Sadam turned a blind eye towards Al-Qaeda letting them stage in his territory.

  


>Christ you are thick aren't you? Please quote where I claimed that.

  


Oh sorry again, the other guy. Nevertheless, that is what he said. Not my fault you decided to jump in to defend someone, and didnt know what he said apperantly...

  


>By definition, yes.

  


Great, so therefore the islands in the south China sea and the reeducation camps China has are also illegal, as the UN stated."
">All the examples I gave are Chinese citizens

The *two* examples you gave are Chinese citizens. Neither of them have said anything about islands in the South China Sea, as you claimed.

Let's refresh that memory of yours:

>I never said I thought **China building islands to expand their territory is bad**, I said that alot of **chinese citizens are concerned by it**.


So far you've provided exactly zero evidence of ""a lot"" of Chinese citizens being concerned by island building in the South China Sea. Instead, you've tried to pass off people criticizing the CCP and even including the protest of the proposed extradition law in Hong Kong as somehow representing people concerned about islands in the South China Sea.

Let's include the dictionary definition of ""a lot""

>a large number or amount of (things, people, etc.) 

[Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/a%20lot%20of)


You are either a serial liar, or you are breathtakingly stupid. Either way,  you've failed to support your claim.


>And what I'm saying is that they had a terrorist organization in their sovereignty who declared war on us and they did nothing about it

No. Let's take a look at what you said:

>I said Sadan **supported** people who declared war on the US, Al-Qaeda

Which is complete, unmitigated bullshit. Not only has the intelligence community and various different post-war commissions concluded that there was [no link  between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein_and_al-Qaeda_link_allegations), but George Bush himself has this to say:

>""What did Iraq have to do with ... the attack on the World Trade Center?"" Bush replied, ""Nothing."" Bush elaborated on his answer and added, ""Nobody has ever suggested that the attacks of September the 11th were ordered by Iraq.""

Sadly, I doubt you are capable of appreciating the [unintentional-irony](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Unintentional%20irony).

Please provide citation of the UN claiming the reeducation camps are illegal."
">Please provide citation of the UN claiming the reeducation camps are illegal.

  


Baha you are something else, aren't you. I put them in quotes because they are clearly much worse. The UN is demanding access to the camps but get Chinas clean up version of them. We know your games, and we are not playing along.

  


>No. Let's take a look at what you said:

Okay, should have picked a better word. So anal, you just be a Han. Either way, I have nothing to prove to you. We will not put up with the CCPs games for much longer, and those who are smart enough in China to lay low and bid time against the CCP will soon have the democracy they deserve. You can live in denial that not all Chinese citizens now down to the CCP, wont change anything.

And like I said, no evidence that shows the link. They only lived in the same region  staged armies in the same area and faught on the same side of the war..."
"The only one playing games here is you. I asked you a simple question. I'll ask it again:

>The UN is demanding access to the camps but get Chinas clean up version of them

Where is your citation for the UN claiming that the re-education camps are illegal?


>Okay, should have picked a better word

No. What you should do is stop spreading blatant lies and misinformation. I'm anal about it because it's the only way to pin down dishonest cretins such as yourself. When pressed on your claims you twist, turn and spout more bullshit. Never a straight answer - and we all know why - it's because you are lying and you know it. I'm simply doing this so everyone reading can see that.

Have you read the agreement? Of course not, because if you had, you would realise Iran is not violating the agreement. It is within its rights to stop some of its commitments if the other signatories do not uphold theirs, which is exactly what happened.

Read article 26 and 36 of the JCPOA. Its clear Iran is not in violation.

Look at guns,ssm, rigging the election in its favour by tightening voter id(I don’t even need Id to vote) In my country we support a government via its policies not ideology"
Isn't that Saudi Arabia?
Also he’s wrong the USA dropped the deal first with no proof that Iran violated it. Multiple inspectors from multiple counties (USA included) stated they were adhering to the deal and the USA just kept saying they were not without proof and then backed out and sanctioned them
"And I am saying Iran is allowed to do that while remaining in the agreement, because of the non-compliance and non-performance of America and Europe. They are not living up to their commitments, therefore Iran is within its rights to drop some of its own commitments while remaining in the JCPOA.

Article 36 of the JCPOA

> If Iran believed that any or all of the E3/EU+3 were not meeting their commitments under this JCPOA, Iran could refer the issue to the Joint Commission for resolution; similarly, if any of the E3/EU+3 believed that Iran was not meeting its commitments under this JCPOA, any of the E3/EU+3 could do the same. The Joint Commission would have 15 days to resolve the issue, unless the time period was extended by consensus. After Joint Commission consideration, any participant could refer the issue to Ministers of Foreign Affairs, if it believed the compliance issue had not been resolved. Ministers would have 15 days to resolve the issue, unless the time period was extended by consensus. After Joint Commission consideration – in parallel with (or in lieu of) review at the Ministerial level - either the complaining participant or the participant whose performance is in question could request that the issue be considered by an Advisory Board, which would consist of three members (one each appointed by the participants in the dispute and a third independent member). The Advisory Board should provide a non-binding opinion on the compliance issue within 15 days. If, after this 30-day process the issue is not resolved, the Joint Commission would consider the opinion of the Advisory Board for no more than 5 days in order to resolve the issue. **If the issue still has not been resolved to the satisfaction of the complaining participant, and if the complaining participant deems the issue to constitute significant nonperformance, then that participant could treat the unresolved issue as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part and/or notify the UN Security Council that it believes the issue constitutes significant non-performance.**

Europe and the US have both failed to live up to their commitments, the issue has not yet been resolved and its been a lot longer than 15 days. There is a clear case of significant non-performance on Europe and Americas behalf. Iran has not seen any of the benefits that were promised as part of the deal. Therefore, Iran is within its rights to drop its commitments in whole or in part, while still remaining in the JCPOA. Iran has chosen to only cease its commitments in part, and has stated it is willing to re-commit once the other parties begin complying with the deal themselves."

US President is using Iran Sanctions to win midterm Elections
I'm surprised they were able to announce this between the successive blowjobs they give to Netanyahu
US to follow Israel’s orders. FTFY
It's as if he is specifically doing everything in his power to deteriorate america in every sense.
"I think the US government wants to make the economic situation in Iran so miserable that the Iranian people decide to overthrow their government. I remember a few months ago Rudi Guliani gave a speech to the MEK where he said 

 “The people of Iran have obviously now had enough. The sanctions are working. The currency is going to nothing! They’re where Russia was. They’re where Poland was. We see signs of young men and women saying ‘Give me some food!’ We saw a sign of a man trying to sell his internal organs for five hundred American dollars — probably a fortune in Iran today! This is truly pitiful. These are the kinds of conditions that lead to successful revolution, and God willing, non-violent revolution.”

He isn't involved in US foreign policy though so who knows if this is what the administration is actually thinking. "

How about the rest of the world imposes sanctions on the US.
"Planning ahead, are we? Calculating how long it will take us to ramp up to full military conflict just in time for the next presidential election cycle?"
"So we were meant to be sanctioning KSA, y'know, for the murdering? But fuck it slap some more on Iran"

"Does anyone play Hearts of Iron? It seems to me the only reason to make sanctions is to intentionally increase world tension. Maybe put a few pennies into the military industrial complex, maybe recruit a few marines. But it's all fun and games until somebody launches a nuke."
And keep up with the economic terrorism that trump is backing. 
"Fire up the centerfuges, hopefully they'll be a seismic event recorded soon"
"What do you think the quote means if not that?

I bet Israeli and Saudi lobbyists got there money’s worth 
So then Iran to reinstate all nuclear weapons production?
"""Tell Iran it was me""

"And if Tehran restarts their nuclear programs in retaliation, the US will have to invade Iran on Israel's behest - just the distraction Trump needs to keep Mueller at bay.

Tell me Americans - how many of you are willing to die in another long drawn war in the Mid East for your so called God Emperor sitting on his Golden Throne?

Bear in mind Iran is no Iraq - these guys can actually fight back even though you will win, and they have far more guns than the Iraqis. Also, the Russians and the Chinese will back them up with weapons too.

So how many Americans are ready to die for their Orange God-Emperor? How much more to the deficit you will add to your debt so your children and grandchildren have to pay?"

Trump doesn't want to upset the Saudis because they do business with him specifically. Boeing can get to fuck as far as he is concerned.
It’s all for Israel
Boeing should just ignore the sanctions and deal with Iran regardless.
Saudis give us billions. Our leaders worship them
Hey if they wanted to succeed they shouldn't be an American company under a stupid administration.
"The US has an established political class who came to power during the 1970s. They saw oil embargo, stagflation and Iran overthrow of the shah. This is a strategic threat in their eyes. The US wants total control of the Hormuz sea. That's their goal. Also secondary goal of easy access to Afghanistan western border. If that happens the Taliban won't stand a chance against the US. Easier supply lines for the US. This is why the US hasn't pulled out of Afghanistan. Iran knows this."
Also hilarious is that the deal had nothing to do with ballistic missiles or foreign deployments of troops...
"IT'S ABSOLUTELY FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE THAT WE CONTINUE TO TOLERATE IRAN'S HOSTILE, PERSISTENT, AND INVASIVE INTERVENTIONS IN YEMEN!

What's that? Oh, the Saudis? Great friends. The best. Tremendous guys. Lots of people are saying it."
Hey you're not supposed to know that
"I wish this was top comment. The US and the Saudis are undertaking a genocide in Yemen but Iran needs to be punished because the deal was ""bad for American interests""... "
You should really provide a source for it too
"Is there any shitty country on earth he doesn't have our god damn military involved in?

All over Africa, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, the god damn border with Mexico

It's almost like WW3 started and nobody noticed or cared"
Well i think thats what he means when he says it was the worst deal ever. Although to be honest im not going to bother pretending to be able to interpret what he means when he talks.
"Trump and his ilk expect Iran to be an American serf state that US businesses can plunder at will, through violent warfare or otherwise. That’s this psychopath’s goal - dead and suffering Iranians for the enrichment of American, Saudi, and Israeli interests. "
"which is weird because [less than 1 in 3 Americans Support this](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/poll-less-than-1-in-3-americans-support-u-s-pullout-from-iran-deal-1.6072087). 

Must be a desperation move to try and get Democrats to overreact and say something stupid. "
"More accurate title.

This party is all about politics.  They know nothing else other than how to market ideas and play politics.  It's pathetic, and it's pathetic that Americans are stupid enough to fall for it."
This move won’t win anyone over. It’s so ducking stupid that only Trump and his administration could come up with it. 
Also gearing up for a war in hopes it helps them win in 2020 most likely
[deleted]
Don't forget Saudi Arabia. They took time to condemn Iran meddling in Yemen. Like... what? 
The US wanted to overthrow the Iran regime since 1979. Way before Israel found them to be a threat. If anything having allies in the region will help them have forward operating bases. I don't support the sanctions but this meme needs to die.
he is because he stands to profit off of it. 
"How do sanctions on Iran hurt America? I guess i can how it could negatively impact our perception on the world stage (lol can it get worse?), but economically its probably a net positive and Iran is no friend of ours strategically or otherwise. "
Lol. If you're for isolating Saudi Arabia I don't see why Iran shouldn't be isolated as well.

"Hurting Iran makes the rest of the world hurt (oil). Not so much America. In fact, US energy exports are booming in part due to stifling Iranian energy. China in just the past month has dropped their Iranian oil imports by over 30% while importing more coal, oil and gas from the US (even in the midst of a trade war). "

Hello Mr NeoNazi.   would you kindly follow in the final steps of your leader....
"Even the Trump State Department certified they were complying.

https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/17/537793465/state-department-certifies-irans-compliance-with-nuclear-deal"
">Was there ever any evidence Iran wasn't complying in full?

Don't think so? If anything, all reports indicate that they were still complying fully - even after all the threats."
"The US pulled out of the deal.

All the other countries are still honoring it, and Iran is still in full compliance.

"
"No, Iran has been in compliance according to all international inspectors. Of course, now they have no reason to stay in compliance and can pursue nuclear weapons, which is actually a logical course of action when faced with a literal madman running the US."
"Honest answer is that Israeli intelligence turned up a small amount of data that Iran had withheld regarding continuance of their program in the early 2000's, which was technically a violation of the agreement. It's about as small a violation as imaginable but it's enough for Republicans to cling to as some sort of justification for saying ""Iran was dishonest, so deal over"""
"It's pretty hard to hide the production of fissile material.  You either need a nuclear power plant to produce plutonium, or several miles of centrifuges to enrich uranium, to say nothing of getting the yellow cake ore in the first place. And both processes take years to produce enough material to make a bomb. Not only would we know, the whole world would know."

Thats what trade war is all about. The less US wants to co operate with foreign countries the less they will go along with US foreign policy.
"Nobody who matters has a choice, it would be national suicide. 

- The EU can’t because we run NATO. 

- China can’t because we give them 60 billion dollars in trade deficit every year. 

- Canada can’t because we’re literally their only land border and take over half their exports. 

- Mexico can’t because we take about 4/5 of their exports. 

I’m not sure who else could possibly have a noticeable effect. "
"If only they would...

But they don't have a spine to stand up to Uncle Sam."
"Nice wish, but you're very ignorant to news as most world liberals are. Denmark. News. Iran. Big news... All of Europe will be on board. Even if they act like they're not. Little thing called top secret strategy. The fake media(CNN, MSNBC, ETC) and struggling liberal goofballs think everything either is, or should be made public. For Example, BO boy giving an exit date in Iraq. Just downright stupid. The Germans, French, and Spanish arent even that dumb. That's why real Americans look down on you. You're living in this fantasy of what you think reality is or should be..rigjt? Right. Like giving an Exit Date in Iraq. Just stupid. So glad we have real leader who gets it and isn't retarded like guy who talked like the WWE's Rock. Arrogance helped create ISIS thanks to his failure policies. Vote Republican, the real, good hearted, loving Americans party. I love the USA. GOD BLESS ALL OF US, even the less intelligent ones. Peace bro. "
"Oh yeah? So you're cool with the Ayatollah, terrorism, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad? You sound really dumb....  The U.S. and Israel seem very determined to handle Iran's Ayatollah TERRORIST leader. And I'm positive they will. Anyway...you seem very disturbed and anti-American. And your dumb opinion is ridiculous. China? The only country that leads in this matter is America, the great superpower. And only. So....quiet down dummy"
Bolton must be painfully erect right now. 
Also actual violent terrorism in the domestic US.
"100% chance of invasion if Iran restarts it's program, which will not go undetected.

"[There have been quite a few since his inauguration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_protests_against_Donald_Trump#During_Trump's_presidency). Online ""protests"" have been happening pretty much constantly as well e.g. anti-Trump subreddits, anti-Trump Twitter hashtags, etc.

Not everyone wants to be protesting on the streets constantly unless that's the only thing they can do. If a recession hits the US before Trump leaves office, then the scale of protests might get a lot bigger as people start to lose their jobs.

Lastly, this type of questions can always be answered with ""apathy"". It applies to pretty much every country in the world."

"Americans are taught by their media and government to hate and fear Iran as their enemy.

They don't care about politics. Neither Trump nor Hillary got a majority in the last election- because only 61.4% of eligible voters voted in 2016. A lot of people just really don't give a shit.
Everyone is living the American dream of being in massive debt so they won't riot because they will lose their jobs.

No...because Obama wouldn't have done something this fucking retarded.
"When Obama made jokes he made them about light hearted and unimportant things. He did not joke about serious political issues or policies in this way. He treated issues like sanctions with the gravity they are due, understanding that they effected real lives. He took his job seriously and approached the office with respect, like all of his predecessors."

"It’s funny that you’re conveniently leaving out the 3-4 proxy wars Iran is heavily funding. Including the one in Yemen. I hate that just because Trump is a shit person and leader we are somehow just going to ignore just how awful and inhuman the Iranian regime is. Iran wants hegemony in the region just like Israel and SA. They just happen to really suck at it, so they get sympathy. It’s a strange world we live in when repeated attempts at regional domination paint you as “the good guy”."
American interests being Israel cosying up to SA and opposing Iran

"If it's stupid but works, it's not stupid."
"Both Saudi Arabia and Israel want to make trouble for Iran, and this administration (as with others, yes, but now to a greater degree) is bizarrely beholden to those two. But most importantly, Trump's family has deals with those nations, too."
That’s simply not true because if it were the us would also impose sanctions against all the other states that behave that way even worse actually 
"Israel considers Iran its greatest threat.  Israel went nuts when sanctions were eased.

We are Israel's bitch.  It is not a meme.  We always act in their best interest, not our own."
Israel IS the biggest threat to regional peace in the Middle East. Unfortunately American politicians love the taste of Israeli ass and enjoy being dick slapped. 
That's what his boss wants. 
"Because the US is punishing Iran for not breaking the deal. Which means that in the future countries have no reason to make deals with US again because theyre known as unreliable, lying dealbreakers you dont wanna sign any papers with.

I know Americans like to fantasize that once Trump is gone, everything will go back to normal, but it wont. Ever. This is now how the US is known. Not to be trusted."
"To name two, a [$20 Billion Boeing deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/08/iran-deal-fallout-boeing-may-lose-20-billion-in-aircraft-deals.html) was canceled. Trump refused to punish Saudi as a risk of a $1 Billion arms deal he helped negotiate would hurt the US too much (he says $100B, but that is another lie).

Also Iran could cutoff maritime traffic through vital chokepoints, Hurting oil shipping of many places putting Russia as the sole supplier to much of Europe and driving up prices hurting the US Economy."
"Because we dont want to rely on Saudi Arabia. The whole reason Obama initiated the Iran deal was so the Saudis couldn't hold us over the barrel (literally) while crashing planes into buildings. It gives the US more leverage.

But honestly if you want to say fuck it to both of them, I'm cool with that too. Just as long as you realize it means we have to get serious about renewables."
"If you're for isolating Iran, you should be for isolating Saudi Arabia."
Because the rest of the world was involved in lifting the international sanctions and Iran hasn't violated its end of the agreement so it would be the US attempting to reimpose sanctions in violation of an agreement we signed and the rest of the world refuses to implement. Its a short term political stunt that will hurt the nation in the long run.
Because he's only doing it to remove Obama's legacy and nothing more. There is more to politics than just friend vs foe. Trump has completely ruined American soft power which took decades to build up.
"Because when you don't honour your deals, you harm your credibility. "
"Yet America continues to love Saudi Arabia.

Maybe because they give people more oil cheaper."
"It’s pretty much the first time virtually every ally is ignoring US sanction.

You know... Their own assets which were frozen out for years but sure keep thinking Obama gave money to the Mullahs.
"There's always some uninformed knuckle-dragger who pops up in an Iran thread and mentions the pallets of cash.

"That's ludicrous nonsense. Invading Iran, a country *geographically larger than both Iraq and Afghanistan combined and as mountainous as the latter,* would be utter political suicide for the republicans. And it likely wouldn't even work out well because *Iraq and Pakistan won't support it.* Them supporting it and letting America use them as staging grounds would lead to civil wars in both countries(which could also spill into KSA).

That would mean a full-on naval invasion in one of the world's most important and sensitive shipping lanes, and then having one of the longest and most mountainous roads possible to Teheran all the while facing a not-incompetent Iranian military that will be heftily supported by major factions in Iraq that would kick the insurgency against America into a frenzy again, all the while Russia provides ""tourists"" and supplies under the table.

It's an absolute logistical and political nightmare. Just doing some air raids would only rally support for the regime domestically, so you can't half-ass it either."

Their Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Sayyid Ali Hosseini Khamenei - ""death to America"" 

Ah let's pay them back plus interest, with cash in the middle of the night.... okayyy

When you pay interest back to hostile governments (while your economy stagnates) who chant death to America, you win. "
">Of course, they don't know (or don't care) that it was Iran's money to begin with.

I mention that I knew it was their money and my main gripe was with the interest paid and the fact that they are continuing to act in the same fasion that lead to the freeze in the  first place. 

Freeze assets because they take hostages, pay them back arguably for hostages, makes sense. 

> uninformed knuckle-dragger

I feel like you have to say this to feel better about yourself. Or maybe to trick yourself into thinking that the majority of the country doesn't support the current administration. 

You can message me next week.

"Why do you financially support a country who holds American hostages continuously, over decades of time? Also one of our most liberal presidents ever Jimmy Carter was the one to make that decision.  

>Iran's assets were first frozen by U.S. president Jimmy Carter in 1979, after revolutionaries overthrew the U.S.-allied Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi's administration and took American hostages. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the United States ended its economic and diplomatic ties with Iran, banned Iranian oil imports and froze approximately 11 billion 1980-US dollars of its assets.[6] 
Many of the assets were then unfrozen in 1981 after the Algiers Accords were signed and the hostage crisis ended

Funny how multiple situations including the one recently involved freaking hostages... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_and_state-sponsored_terrorism

>On multiple occasions, US courts have awarded damages to the victims of terrorism; deemed payable by Iran on the basis that although the attacks were not directly controlled by Iran, evidence shows Iranian payments supporting these terrorist groups

You parading around as a white knight and your intentions are quite the opposite. Don't take hostages, don't support terrorism, don't chant ""death to America"" and the US won't screw you financially, pretty simple. 

Also Obama sent cash to them in different currencies, knowing that Iran has been found guilty of state sponsored terrorism. 

>On Jan. 16, 2016, the same day four American detainees, including The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian, were released, a jumbo jet carrying $400 million in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies landed in Tehran. That money purportedly was partial payment of an outstanding claim by Iran for U.S. military equipment that was never delivered.

Paragraph 14.

https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/245317.pdf

""Iran will fully implement the ""Roadmap for Clarification of Past and Present Outstanding Issues"" agreed with the IAEA, containing arrangements to address past and present issues of concern relating to its nuclear programme...""

It was definitely a violation, just a mostly inconsequential one that should not have endangered the agreement."
That war would be immensely unpopular.
"Not only that, but they have para-military groups like the ""guardians of the revolution"" and shit like that, ensuring that even if (well when really) the US wins that war, the ensuing occupation will be literal hell for US troops, exactly like some sort of Iraq 2.0..."
"My opinion can be disregarded on dumb little liberal Reddit. My VOTE for President Trump matters. I voted for Trump to end terrorism. So it looks like, in reality, your opinion doesn't matter. America is very close to ending the terrorist regime there. Through sanctions or whatever else is on the table. So it looks like your opinion is ""AUTOMATICALLY DISREGARDED"" you shit-wipe. Ask yourself. What is reddits opinion versus reality? Now...what were you saying dipshit??"
"North Korea got nukes while we were at the height of the Iraq war, we were distracted. The military isn’t going to let another country go nuclear against our wishes again."
"If Iran moves towards developing a program like North Korea did, there's little doubt in my mind the U.S. would avoid invading unless Russia directly offered them protection of their nuclear umbrella, which come to think of it might be exactly the result of this round of escalation."
">That's ludicrous nonsense. Invading Iran, a country geographically larger than both Iraq and Afghanistan combined and as mountainous as the latter, would be utter political suicide for the republicans

Iraq was political suicide for Republicans too, they still did it. Nothing wins on irrationality more often than a pro-war argument.

The Republican base will absolutely revolt if Iran is determined to be building nuclear weapons and there is no military response. Politicians will barely have a choice. 

It likely won't be a full-on invasion at the outset like Iraq, it would start with punitive measures against the nuclear sites to look tough and see if it convinces them to stop the program. It won't, so then it will move into things like naval skirmishes and missile strikes. There will be pressure to move in before Iran can build a bomb and Saudi Arabia and Israel will be pushing us hard behind the scenes. I don't see any Republican president beating the tide pushing them to invade, and it would be a challenge for any democrat at least. 

It would be a complete disaster and fuck the USA, but I've never seen that deter right-wing foreign policy ideas."
"I thought, nay, I PRAYED, that tweet wasn't real. Holy fucking mother of god."
">I cant wait for when our leader is graceful again.

If Obama did this there would be cries of laughter and cheering.  The conservatives who felt it was unpresidential would be laughed at and jeered as being old white men who didn't understand memes.  

There is hypocrisy inherent to both sides.  Except to the side who doesn't give a shit about dank memes.

The issue with Iran getting nukes is that, then Saudi Arabia will want nukes, and maybe Iraq and Turkey as well? 

That's part of why Israel won't officially admit to having nukes (they totally have them, but shhh its a secret) - they don't want to start a nuclear arms race.

And the more countries have nukes, the more chances that something will go wrong. Maybe a nuclear accident, or maybe terrorists will get ahold of the nukes? Etc. 

Even America itself has had a couple of close calls - they even dropped a nuke on Virginia once in the 60's, but thankfully it didn't explode."

"> Oil isnt really a concern for us at this point tbh.

I get what you are saying, price goes up we could produce all the oil for domestic uses, feed our cars, heat our homes... But 1) much of that infrastructure and rights are owned by foreign investors, who will of course sell to the highest payer. 2) much of the impact to our economy is built upon exchange of goods outside the US that are thus cannot use US oil, and is shipped using more oil.  So our economy is heavily impacted. 3) it is a huge power shift, when more of the world goes to Russia for oil, and have to deal with more instability caused by dictators getting more power as oil profits soar.

Of course this backing out of deals over political change and purely political purposes also heavily impacts our reputation for deals with NK, etc. And undermines any credibility with Saudi when we bow to their money despite them causing way more turmoil for us (having funded the killing of tens of thousands of Americans, and continuing to do so) and their undermining US values in the world more than Iran has ever come close to."
"> Iran knows better than to cut off the straights.

If their oil sales are cut to a small % of now, it is guaranteed they fuck with the straights, lay some mines... Most likely they will get enough bypassing the sanctions to mostly wait out when Trump is out of office though, and not want to make too much noise so the next guy can go back to the old deal."

Saudi Arabia sponsored 9/11 just so you know.
And Saudi being one the biggest sponsors of terrorism is okay? 
"Iran protests America in their own country and they are the worst people in the world. Meanwhile KSA sponsors terrorists, some of which committed the worst terrorist act of the modern world (which funnily enough occurred in the US) but they get away with it because they don't talk about it? Come on now."

"I'd hate Americans too if they had violently overthrown my democratically elected government for planning to nationalize my country's oil production, after which the Americans installed a brutal puppet dictator who sold out the country to them."

"But the Saudis are cool, right? They only kill Americans who deserve it, like that journalist guy."
"Yes let's fuck over the Iranians, a peaceful and modern culture with values similar to our own, where women are highly educated and active in business and politics.

Instead, let's get in bed with the Saudis who actively finance terrorist attacks that have killed thousands of Americans this century, who practice slavery and human trafficking on a massive scale, and where the ruling family asserts 1300s-style absolute power. Brilliant."

Hardly. The atmosphere of fear and patriotic and nationalistic vitriol after 9/11 was still going strong in 2003. It's disaster was more long-term, and it is still fresh in people's minds, which is why people are war weary. Those conflicts aren't done yet for America. Iraq is settling down, but with a government in charge that is highly pro-Iran.
It would be a safe way to cement Trump as yet another warmongering republican president.

I'm perfectly willing to believe Trump would be literally demented enough to approve of this, but there's a lot of other people in the white house working to try to soothe and restrain his worst behavior, so anything like an invasion is not a guarantee."

"> No, can't be

I mean that's pretty much it. Obama was a fairly popular president, and is still fairly popular, and under him the US went through the longest sustained period of economic growth in its history.

The real answer is Hillary Clinton. While Obama was and still is popular, Clinton was not, and Trump took advantage of his weak opposition. Trump, although one of the least popular major party candidates in modern history, was able to win the electoral college because his opponent was also very unpopular."

"Obama was like the ideal political leader, being charismatic, educated, well spoken, patient, _handsome_ (tell me it doesn't help), willing to compromise.

He sometimes even made people forget about the villagers he was blowing up, to the point of making children afraid of clear skies.

"Iran just isnt really that much of a player on the global scale. They exported like 1 billion barrels of oil in 2017. I know that sounds like a lot but we were producing 15+ million barrels per day. 1 billion barrels is really a drop in the bucket. Iran isn't even a top 5 global producer of oil. The oil really isn't an issue. The only way it could become one is if Iran got together with China and Russia and whoever else and decided to move away from the petro dollar with enough support to destabilize our position as the global reserve currency....The last few countries to try that it didn't work out for them so well. 

To answer your points directly
1) Im not actually sure specifically what you mean here. Who would could pay more than we can? Why would they pay the cost to export etc when demand domestically would be plenty high. If worse came to worse we would just outlaw exporting crude oil again. 

2) Again im not sure what this sentence means. We would still be able to fuel ships etc and companies would procure fuel on the global market if we could not. Its not like the us government owns the ships that carry goods. I doubt most of those ships get their oil in the US as it is. Price of goods may rise though. 

3) Again we are talking about a really small amount of oil here. Iran's oil not on the market just isn't producing some global power shift to Russia. Their production and exports have been down anyway so even if they went back up some no big deal. 

Obviously politically Trump is a joke diplomatically and half the shit he does undermines out global alliances and partnerships. This deal no more than any other. Going to need a source for ""continuing to do so"" though. Saudis are shit partners and shit people though no argument from me there. "

"If you take out the state of California, Trump won the popular vote *substantially*. Point is, he won the majority of states, and in those majority of states he had the popular vote. When it comes to the midterms his far reaching influence will benefit republican candidates much more than someone like Hillary who did well in LA, Seattle and NY. 

For example, Trump won like 3,000 counties, Hillary won like 200. 

We can break it down next week after midterms. You'll see. 

Also I honestly think Trump has gained more support since 2016 (mainly due to strong economy), I sincerely think the majority of Americans support Trump. "

"The quote is the text where Iran agreed to share all relevant previous information and research they conducted on their nuclear program in years past. Israeli intelligence recently discovered that their program was active for several years after they declared it stopped in 2003, and the details of this had been kept secret by Iran. So they didn't share the info they agreed to. That's the violation. And as I said it's quite minor and not in any way worth causing much of a fuss over. "
"Because of the available evidence, or lack thereof. 

There is absolutely nothing to indicate they ever produced anything close to a nuclear weapon. If they did it in secret, it was the most (relatively) advanced and secretive military operation of all time."
"There's no tenable strategy in constantly aggressing towards Iran for doing nothing serious. This has been a long-term push by Republicans for over a decade, it's extremely hard to imagine that invasion, or at least a major war, isn't their goal."

They didn't have nukes. But neither Russia, or China really interested in disrupting world economy. They are preparing for possible disruption, but it's driven by fundamentals ( USA economy is 17% of world economy but over 60% of world currency reserves).

Seriously, just look at how Warren tried to go viral with her native ancestry story.  It was coordinated with multiple news outlets to BTFO trump and it backfired completely because she didn't understand or have the means to fight that particular battle.  

Trump memes because he can.  Others mimic and some are successful.  Then some deride anything that they personally can't accomplish themselves as unpresidential until their candidate comes out on stage on a fucking skateboard and then declare him fucking ""hip"" like they got their idea for what the kids will vote for from a 90s butterfinger commercial."

">This instance isnt vulgar

You just got done calling Trump vulgar in response to posting an innocuous meme that pissed you off.

>but you have to be quite literally retarded to think Trump isnt. 

No doubt.  But certainly no worse than previous presidents who albeit weren't quite so public about it.  Remember when Bill nutted on Monica?  At the very least Trumps more vulgar misdeeds are sourced from DNC watersports fanfiction.

>I'm not offended. I'm embarrassed. Most decent people would be.

You're not offended yet you claim that all ""decent"" people should be embarrassed about a meme that you don't enjoy because it didn't come from the twitter account of your preferred politician.  

This is why people are increasingly turned off by both sides.  Neither side can realize how easy it is to spot their hysterics whenever they don't get their way.  

Cruz for instance dropped a fun halloween tweet about the meme that he's the Zodiac killer, something utterly prepostorous.  Yet people managed to get offended and claimed he was disrespecting the victims by being self deprecating.  

Many of the people who were mad had it pointed out that they joyously took part in the meme during the 2016 presidential election.  

I'm sorry, but anybody who claims to be offended by this tweet is in my opinion very obviously not offended, but merely trying to stir up sentiment in their favor.  Because let's be honest, a GoT meme is fun.  Unless it's somebody you don't like saying it.  In which case it's evil, vile, insert bullshit adjective here.

TL;DR:  Anybody honestly made about a meme is dumb.  Anybody claiming to be mad but actually not is a hypocrite.  Those are the only two camps you have to choose from.

The US gave up opportunities for oil dominance, among other likely correlating things, but quite frankly that's inconsequential IMO in the big, long term picture.

The US continues to mess up the ME.  Going after economies makes countries unstable.  I saw the deal as a change in the US government's traditional methodology of keeping a thumb on smaller and weaker countries who don't bend to its will.  Thanks for the question."

"Your argument is nonsensical because it is based on a preface that ignores the entire population of California, which is a part of the USA. Trump won the election because of only 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, yet Clinton received a national total 66 million votes versus Trump's 63 million. You seem to think that the midterm election results will somehow affect me. Luckily I'm not an American, which means they won't."

"Obama never used a meme to announce sanctions against another country, like geopolitics is some stupid game.

The evidence I have to back that up is that it never happened.  That was my statement.  Period. Full stop.

Trump memes because his supporters are fucking morons who don’t know any better. "

The same moronic sentiment we see over and over about ""bOtH sIdEs!!1!""

There is no level too low to stoop to try to make this connection.

Definitely. This meme bullshit from the president regarding foreign policy is garbage. I had just never recognized that actual zodiac victim families may hurt due to the jokes about ted. So now I have to think about it haha. 
"Trump’s rhetoric just led to people in my neighborhood getting killed.  It led to a man trying to murder many people Trump called his enemies.  The murder of minorities too numerous for me to keep count.

What have you done to stand up against it?

Nothing, because you support it."
Lack of evidence is not proof
"Lol. Democrats commit acts of violence against people they disagree with as well.

Violence is human I am afraid. Now stop being a looney.

No but lack of evidence combined with lack of suspicion generally is pretty close.

This is coming from the top of the Republican Party, and you support it.

Lol Iran? Lack of suspicion?
That they have already developed weapons? Yes.
Then what were they doing with all of those centerfuges and ICBMs? 
Building the basics for a nuclear program that never got close to producing a bomb.

"[EDIT: wording and formatting; added one final sentence]

Sorry Automod, gotta walk over you this time, as I have yet to come across similar coverages from other English media outlets yet. 

With the US–HK relation already strained by the fugitive ordinance debacle and the US–PRC trade war looming, it is an extremely unwise move for our local government to further draw the ire of the States. We’re already getting dangerously close to having the West completely ostracize us, and this now is borderline suicide.  
... or perhaps this, being far from a fluke, is another of our administration’s calculated politically-correct (not in the current left-right dynamics sense, but in the original, Communist-speak sense) moves to snub the West and kiss up to the Chinese Central Government, at the cost of the city’s continued prosperity and its citizens’ livelihoods, freedom, and security. 

It has only gotten worse since the newish Chief Executive came into power. First by ceding areas in the West Kowloon High-Speed Rail station over to Chinese customs and jurisdiction, then by ousting The VP of the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in HK and threatening to discontinue leasing their current premises to them, among other things; and now we have this. 

I kid you not. “If” – scratch that, make it “when” – we are finished with metamorphosing into “just another coastal Chinese city”, you can be sure that it will not be owing to anyone’s folly, “patriotic” fervor, nor misjudgment – it will be by design, of those in control and those above them even. And we can do jack diddly, as our poor excuse of a “democracy” is a farce."

Iran is undermining westren support by infiltrating progressive parties in the EU and US and trying to set up an alternative finance system that will get around US sanctions that Russia will use too.

I think it's a little early to push like this as the US can and is willing to turn Iran into an open air prison dying of hunger, thirst and plague.  But there is a time limit.

"Oil disruption was factored in to the WW3 planning of the cold war so much so that tanks and small ships are powered by variable fuel gas turbines and nuclear if able.

The US is now the world largest oil producer not including Canada and Mexico feeding into the system with the pipelines cross crossing the nation.

Plus the self driving change is also an electric vehicle revolution because with EV you can charge them with robotic charging bays.  This technology is going to migrate to cargo semis, delivery vehicles, mining and farming equipment making them effectively LNG powered.

"Time and again, sanctions have been shown to strengthen, not weaken regimes. This is only going to accomplish two things: play to the hard Right in Iranian politics and the hard Right in American politics... both of whom want to waste lives and treasure to accomplish pretty much, nothing... a war with Iran would be about as successful as the one in Iraq, but with worse sectarian bloodshed. 

This is another classic example of certain circles in the US having extreme opinions about our geopolitical adversaries without bothering to know a single thing about them, their history, or their  politics. We destroyed Iraq because of WMDs they didn't have, Libya willingly surrendered their WMDs to warm up to the West -- both descended into chaos... then look at North Korea (develop weapons and you get a presidential visit)... it's clear to any state actor that nuclear weapons aren't used to ""wipe out"" your enemies... they're used to improve your bargaining power and stave off foreign invasion. Our regional partners know this and are desperate to prevent it... but a war in that region will only cost *American* blood and treasure - not theirs. They are albatrosses around our necks.

Could this mean that banks have to choose between dealing with the EU or US, in a most extreme situation? Or rather, US or the rest of the world...

And now Trump is showing them that they did that for nothing."

"> Iran is a evil and oppressive government run by extremists

Iran's government is evil, oppressive, and run by extremists, but a deal was made.  Abiding by that deal does not mean ""Iran should get a pass"" (they still have to abide by the strictest nuclear inspection regime ever implemented), and people saying it's wrong to unilaterally break that deal for no good reason isn't an expression of love for Iran.  It's a plea to honor deals made by *us*.  It's not about Iran, it's about living up to our own ideals so that our word isn't worthless the next time we try to negotiate something."

"I actually agree. I think there’s a distinction between sanctions-for-regime-change and sanctions-for-a-negotiated-settlement, but none of that matters now because our artless negotiator in chief is psychologically incapable of negotiating anything. His only goal is *winning* (which can only be defined as whichever outcome guarantees  him narcissistic supply) and he will give away the store on details he doesn’t care to understand in exchange for a bright and shiny publicity tool that gives us nothing... and even then will reneg on everything after the fact if it benefits him for the moment. You’re right - he is showing them that there is no use cooperating with the US in general and him in particular. (My prediction, is he’ll “negotiate” a new deal that’s exactly like the Former and claim victory because this time it’s *his*)"
"Too late. We did the same shit for the same reasons in the 90s. 

>Soon after the agreement was signed, U.S. Congress control changed to the Republican Party, who did not support the agreement. Some Republican Senators were strongly against the agreement, regarding it as appeasement. Initially, U.S. Department of Defense emergency funds not under Congress' control were used to fund the transitional oil supplies under the agreement, together with international funding. From 1996 Congress provided funding, though not always sufficient amounts. Consequently, some of the agreed transitional oil supplies were delivered late. KEDO's first director, Stephen Bosworth, later commented ""The Agreed Framework was a political orphan within two weeks after its signature"".

Maybe so. Maybe it also helps other countries  learn not to continue to sponsor terror and fight us via proxy wars and expect us to abide by it.

...says r-politics guy. 
[removed]
"Agreed, a wiser man wouldn't have said something like that on a site like this."
"Had the deal not been done the other countries would still be on board, whose fault is that? Logically the original sanctions by all countries involved should be put into place, but it's political suicide because of how Trump is portrayed in the media. And to be fair he could keep his mouth shut a bit and just get on with it. Kimi Raikkonen would make a great world leader."
"So the strategy Obama and the rest of the world wanted to take with Iran was to make a deal that would essentially deradicalize Iran and end their possible need to create nuclear weapons. 

The terms placed on Iran were that they would have to seriously reduce their nuclear energy program (which was thought to also include a nuclear weapons program) to the point that it's insurable and allow inspectors from the IAEA full rights to regularly inspect all of Iran to ensure no nuclear materials were being create and no weapons program existed. In exchange, the US and all other members of the agreement, would lift sanctions and allow companies to invest in Iran's economy. 

The plan was that, over the course of the 20 or so years the deal would apply, Iran would economically develop and integrate with the world economy in such a way that going for nukes would be unecessary and counter productive. At the same time, this would deradicalize the country by showing that the West is not evil and can be reasoned with, which was part of the platform that their current moderate president was running on. 

Since the deal has been signed, Iran has complied with everything its asked for and no inspectors have discovered any increases in their nuclear energy stockpiles or any weapons program. 

The problem now with Trump bringing back the sanctions is that it's essentially proving the radicals in Iran right--that the US cannot be trusted and is out to get them. It was a real watershed moment when the  moderates won with a positive view of the West. So placing sanctions on for no reason completely ruined everything the moderates there succeeded in achieving and basically guarantees that the radicals in Iran will win future  elections because they benefit from America being the bad guy. 

Additionally, despite the fact that the US didn't officially ratify the agreement through Congress, all other countries in the agreement essentially see this as the US going back on their word and undermining the deal they spent years negotiating to create. Some are even circumventing the US's decision, like China and the EU, because of how valuable they think the deal is and how stupid the US is being. So the fact that the US is basically undermining their interests on Trump's whim to fuck everything Obama means these other countries have less of an interest in cooperating with the US again in the future.

So all the sanctions do is actively prevent Iran's economy from improving, which further radicalizes them, and piss off Europe and the rest of the permanent members of the UN Security Council. "
"There were good short-term reasons to be fair to President Obama. Hostages being the biggest, I'm sure they're extremely grateful for his negotiating their release, and theoretically it was meant to ease tensions. The problem though in my opinion was Khamenei, he's hell-bent and can't really be reasoned with so any agreement was already null before Trump nullified it officially. Except for the hostages, they won't be going back anytime soon. Iran will be an enemy as long as Khamenei is running things as a theocracy. "

Never said they weren’t. Negotiating and agreeing aren’t the same thing.
"I’d love him to try to negotiate but Iran won’t be having it. They know he’ll double cross again, and they don’t want to give him the credibility either."
And you think these sanctions will? If anything they will only embolden the extremists and Iran will remain isolated for years to come.

"What do you exactly mean by “radicals”? You do know there is no such thing as radicals in Iran. If that was their case, then the US’s Republican Party should also be considered as “radicals”. Just saying "
So you're saying that Trump exited the deal because it was assumed that Iran wouldn't be able to live up to the terms? Just assumed?
Good point. Forgot about the hostages. Yeah I see no reason to not stick it to him however we can. 
There was no deal before the US agreed to negotiate.

Financially for the short term it's helped corporations do business with Iran. Long term though it really isn't helping anyone other than Iran.
"If it's ratified by Congress then that's not the case, because legally, under the principle of pacta sund servanda, all treaties and agreements with other countries count as being between the states themselves and not their specific governments. "
"There was evidence of them not living up to it already. It's not as flagrant as people want things to be, just like with Iraq where even though WMDs were found the media had hyped it up to be nukes instead of caches of chemical weapons (which were found) so everyone was disappointed and thought it had all been made up. "
Yes that how deals work. You negotiate first and then agree on a deal.
"This is what the Trump administration doesn't get. A major change in Iran will never happen as long as the Iranian people feel threatened from outside forces. This why the goverment has survived for as long as it has. No one in Iran wants to end up like Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen or Syria, which would be in the interests of Iran's regional rivals, chief among them the Kindom of Saudi Arabia. The JCPOA was a good step in the right direction but it looks like the majority of Americans believes sanctions is the best way forward even though it hasn't worked for nearly 40 years."

"Hey now don't call Trump fascist or they'll vote for him to spite you (they weren't going to otherwise, obviously). "
"What was the point of keeping the sanctions in place. US wasn’t stopping Iran from getting a nuke, and Iran is not going to collapse. You have to make a deal at some point. "
"Long-term, you've averted a potential nuclear threat emerging in the Middle East while also deradicalizing them through economic development that integrated them into the global economy. 

Those are some pretty good long term benefits for the US, and the rest of the world, right there, which seems to be what you missed from the deal."
"Well, that's just until it's not. It's not like any norms mean anything to Republicans and Trump "
"They literally have inspectors on the ground who are checking on their nuclear activities, so far all evidence from those inspections have come back with Iran complying."
"Like what evidence? I can't seem to find a credible site talking about that. Also, with the Iraq war we knew they had chemical weapons because we're the ones who sold them to them."
"> There was evidence of them not living up to it already

Name one that wasn't a shitty Powerpoint presentation."
Yes you're assuming it is because of sanctions that Iran negotiated and agreed to deal where as you have really nothing to back this up because it is the US that refused to negotiate in the first place.
 Your probably right. We should have just killed the leaders and dropped a few bombs on the nuclear sites.  Why bother with using efforts that don’t result in mass casualties after all right? I mean we all know Iran just wants nukes to protect itself...
"If they were actually concerned with financiers of terrorism, they wouldn't be buddying up with Saudi Arabia right now.  But they are so it seems that rationale is baseless.

If they are claiming Iran broke the terms of the deal, the evidence is to the contrary and it appears the US is acting in bad faith.  It embarrasses the country on the national stage and sows distrust in any future partners.  It is the opposite of what someone who claims to be good at making deals would do.

Also, the President of the self-proclaimed greatest country in the world is supposed to set a high standard.  An unoriginal idea for a joke made in poor taste doesn't even set a high standard for humor on the internet much less for the POTUS.

Silly, pathetic people laugh at silly, pathetic jokes."
"I think it is a serious issue and should be taken seriously. 
I also have my doubts about Iran being the number one financier of terror, isn't that just a Trump quote? "
Saudi Arabia funded 9/11.
Why thank you. It's always nice to know having achieved something.
Iran was kept from having the money needed to really be a threat. With sanctions they were in serious financial trouble.
I mean it's not even about norms there but actual international treaty law. Not following through on treaty commitments is a breach and the wronged party is entitled to remedies. 
Nah man he gets his information spoon fed to him via Fox and Friends.
"No, like I said, I'm assuming that Iran *agreed to the terms* of the negotiation because of the sanctions (primarily because eliminating the sanctions were part of the terms)."

"I honestly believe Pakistan is more of a concern and they are both nuclear-armed and in better trade standing with the US. By that viewpoint, Iran doesn't deserve harsh trade sanctions. If we ignore comparisons to other countries, I still see no way in which reverting the sanctions will advance US interests."
[deleted]
I like how you have no real response to the Saudi point above. Also Iran has kept its side of the agreement. This just makes the USA the bad guys - the ones who entered into an agreement and reneged. 
Salt is a poor measure of wise policy. 
"I think it is pretty debatably who #1 is. I am not saying they aren't on the shortlist. Like Saudi Arabia isn't listed in any of those reports, so that seems off. Maybe #1 sponsor of terror that the US doesn't need for oil. I mean Yemen must have put Saudi Arabia over the top. "
"Since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the government of Iran has been accused by members of the international community of funding, providing equipment, weapons, training and giving sanctuary to terrorists."
"I think Iran is a less likely candidate to launch a first strike regardless of MAD than Pakistan. This may change as the individuals in power do, but presently I don't believe any target (likely Tel Aviv due to Iran's stance on whether or not Israel should exist) outweighs potentially catapulting all of Iran into the afterlife in the minds of Iran's military policy makers."
What part of the JCPOA don’t you get?! The deal prevented them from acquiring nukes and were under 24/7 international surveillance
"Iran has not kept their side. They have refused all checks to their nuclear sites.

Do you want to debate this?"
What country funded 9/11? 
">Like Saudi Arabia isn't listed in any of those reports, so that seems off.

I know you wish they were (to stay on narrative), but they are not. Even your buddies CNN say so.

"
The issue isn't really about Iran launching a nuclear missile but setting off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia has already said they'll acquire nuclear weapons if Iran does. And these are not stable governments. It's putting global non-proliferation at extreme risk. 
I think you responded to the wrong person.
"Once again, I note your complete refusal to acknowledge the point on Saudi Arabia. 

When did iran refuse these checks? "
"They are currently causing a famine in Yemen. No one made that up. 

*Did I miss something do the conspiracy nuts not believe there is a famine in Yemen right now? "
"Ah, I'm seeing how all the lines interconnect. If Iran gets nuclear weapons, Saudi will, whcih means our policy iwth them would hit a lose-lose situation."
"Saudi Arabia in Yemen has nothing to do with terrorism. It's a fun talking point when you have nothing else, obvious by the repeated insistence on addressing it. You can cling to that talking point as much as you want but you will not find a source to back you up.

I thought you were well versed on this topic. Why DID Iran refuse the checks that they agreed to in the infallible 'Iran Deal'?"
"it's a good dodge, but we were talking about Iran remember? Look how far you have derailed the conversation because the facts aren't on your side."
"I don't think Yemen was the only talking point that person was raising when talking about Saudi links to terrorism...

And as for Iran, the agreement allows the IAEA to inspect any declared nuclear sites they want and Iran has agreed to those inspections. It has not agreed to allow foreign nations to inspect any other military sites, and it has not agreed to any inspections that the UN ambassador Nikki Haley alone has demanded, as opposed to the IAEA. 

As such, it hasn't broken its end of the agreement."
Saudi Arabia paid alqaeda in Yemen. They are connected to isis funding. Bin laden is Saudi and they have connections to 9/11.  Saudi spreads and practices the most extreme  version of islam which Alaaeda and affiliates practice and enforce. 
Werent most of the the plane jackers from 9/11 Saudi Arabia? Or do you not call that terrorism anymore?

Sanctions are better than War.
Cyber attack?
Sanctions are economical war; especially if they results and cause deaths.
"It's pointless trying to understand America's foreign policy. Using trumps wisdom they pull out of this accord applied sanctions while Iran was meeting its commitments. What did these sanction achieve? Was Trump more  interested in destroying obamas legacy, and attacking democrats when he violated the accord.
European leaders won't be fooled by American childishness.  We need to respect the Iranian nation not try an start a civil war like America is doing in South American countries.
America has supplied between 30 to 300 nuclear warheads to Israel without informing the UN. Iran has every right to defend itself just like Israel. 
Maybe Europe need to look to Russia or China because America has turned into crazy town where only American rights and interests are worth protecting."
"So someone whose job it is to support u.s. policy towards Iran no matter what is supporting u.s. policy towards Iran?

So the net result of sanctions against Iran as far as I am concerned is that I pay more for my gas.  Thanks Trump!

United States), the United States withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction in 1986 to accept the court's jurisdiction only on a case-by-case basis.[4] Chapter XIV of the United Nations Charter authorizes the UN Security Council to enforce Court rulings. However, such enforcement is subject to the veto power of the five permanent members of the Council, which the United States used in the Nicaragua case.""

"They can order it, but the order can be vetoed, and of course will be.  However, any time a veto is used it demonstrates that the vetoing party is flying against international opinion and international law on the issue in question."
I was just reading about this. It's going to go nowhere. 
"Iran almost certainly brought this case to the court in the expectation that the US will veto it. That's why Iran bothered, to expose US hypocrisy and further de-legitimize the US when they use the veto.

They never had any real expectation that this judgement would restore those supplies. It was to show the rest of the world that the US is out of line. It's a smart, rational and fair move by Iran."
"From your link:

> The United States had signed the treaty accepting the Court's decision as binding, but with the exception that the court would not have the power to hear cases based on multilateral treaty obligations unless it involved all parties to the treaty affected by that decision or the United States specially agreed to jurisdiction. The court found that it was obliged to apply this exception and refused to take on claims by Nicaragua based on the United Nations Charter and Organization of American States charter, but concluded that it could still decide the case based on customary international law obligations with 11-4 majority.

So unless it involves every country that is a party to the deal, the court doesn’t have jurisdiction. "

Because it settles legal disputes between member states of the UN.

Even the US house of Representatives voted in heavily in favour of ratifying the deal at the time. 

The only notable critics are Trump and Netanyahu and both seem to have political motivations for objecting.

So I would say that international opinion is certainly not in America's favour on this matter."
His comment was lame. 
"Wasn't the deal to prevent them from gaining nuclear weapons technology? And isn't that happening entirely in spite of US withdrawal from the agreement?

I agree Iran needs to start becoming more progressive, but scrapping the Iran Nuclear Deal and punishing them with illegal sanctions is not the way to achieve that goal. 

Iran's human rights issues are an entirely separate problem and need to be addressed separately. 

Also let's not pretend that the Trump administration's sanctions on Iran are anything to do with the human rights issues, when they are clearly a reinstatement of pre-nuclear deal sanctions in an attempt to undermine the continued global efforts to uphold the original agreement."
"That's not how this works. Do you honestly believe that an ""oppressive regime"" will allow themselves to be economically strapped by sanctions if it were down to them or the common folk?

Sanctions do not help when the state they are targeting rely on that international trade for public stability. 

The ""stability"" that you speak of, is different than the one i speak of. The US's form of stability that they bring surely cannot be called that. Just look at Iraq, Libya, Syria, Chile, Vietnam, South Korea, Cuba. The US's presence always resulted in total chaos or power vacuums that attracted extremist parties bent on revenge and control. Other times they propped up puppet politicians that were either cruel dictators (like Pinochet in Chile or  Carlos Castillo Armas in Guatemala) or shitty politicians that exploited the riches/resources of the region (like they did in Iraq in the 1900s, and Caribbean countries i.e. Panama/Cuba/ Dominican Republic etc).

Every country the US has touched, unless returned back to a left wing party or taken by a revolutionary group (ala Castro) it turns into shit or a chaotic mess. "

Pretty sure she wasnt executed for that. She was executed for murdering people she claims raped and brutalised her. Quite the difference.

If Iran were a bastion of human freedom and tolerance, then their nuclear program wouldn't be as concerning. But since they're not, everyone's terrified of how they'll use those weapons."
">Do you honestly believe that an ""oppressive regime"" will allow themselves to be economically strapped by sanctions if it were down to them or the common folk?

I expect the regime to collapse. Propping up these regimes prolongs their rule.

You've made a good case that direct intervention has unreliable results. It's better if people fix their own problems. So if they choose a disastrously unstable form of government, they'll do so once the consequences are undeniable."
kinda like making trade sanctions a human rights issue huh?
You're talking about a different judgement though. The judgement I'm talking about is a legal decision and you definitely don't have the power to do so. (Unless you're a judge ofc)

The USA might not have been legally bound to the ICJ but it isn't automatically hostile. The Obama administration worked with the ICJ and collaborated with the Court a lot.
"Basically, yeah.  Vastly decreased support for the US's actions in the international stage cost taxpayers a huge amount of money and fucks up our position on the international stage in the long run, which also has a financial cost.

"It is an issue when the biggest exports of iran (whom are in the top 5 of energy superpowers) are being sanctioned and affecting local economies. The country has nationalized their exports to benefit the people. And with the sanctions hitting their trade potential, they are cutting off things that people need to survive.

Here's a brief anecdote:

[Pharmaceuticals and medical equipment do not fall under international sanctions, but Iran is facing shortages of drugs for the treatment of 30 illnesses—including cancer, heart and breathing problems, thalassemia and multiple sclerosis —because it is not allowed to use international payment systems. A teenage boy died from haemophilia because of a shortage of medicine caused by the sanctions. Deliveries of some agricultural products to Iran have also been affected for the same reasons.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran#Humanitarian_impact)"

Its clear to me that ive learned/read more about economics than you have, and a wider range of analysis and critique. For if you truly ready some Marx you would be able to acknowledge truly how flawed the capitalist structured economy is."

"Because the ""judgement"" you're talking about is your opinion.

The ""judgement"" I'm talking about is the ""judgement"" used when talking about law. It's the decision made by a court/judge.

So unless you or I am a judge, we can't make a judgement of the kind I'm talking about."
Look up the word caliphate. The words splitting up doesn't do a justice. 
Well “dethroning the dollar” is a good start. After that I assume you want America to be socialist at a minimum which is another great start to failure. 
"Hahaha it's almost hilarious, this straw man you're constructing."
Firstly it seems like we are mixing up the ICJ with the ICC. The ICJ was set up not long after the foundation of the UN to mediate disputes between nations whereas the ICC was set up in the year 2000 to prosecute international war crimes. The ICC has not yet even really investigated any American so the point is moot. The Obama Administration did help with investigations and enforcement for third parties. The court doesn't really investigate crimes which are already being dealt with by national courts though and in theory there should be no reason for it to do so long as the US justice system is working correctly.
"Trump hasn't been getting his way, of course, and the US is hurting very sorely on the trade front thanks to his actions. He's spending taxpayer money by fucking up trade and foreign relations."
You think that's bad? Internal policy since 2002 has rendered the average American completely unable to detect sarcasm.
"So a country trying to live their way without stepping on toes, while distributing their fruits of their labor and resources to their people, and engaging in active trade with others around the world have to adhere to US (+other capitalist powers) wants/needs or else they face economic warfare?

This country is being strong-armed into doing things another way and because they choose not to, they are hit with sanctions. Which then affect the general public, to which imperialist powers claim ""humans rights violations *finger wag - finger wag*!"" and try to setup grounds to invade/bomb/overthrow.

By the way they also want them to lose the nuclear arms. Why? What sense does it make to deny somebody the ability to fight back against other nuclear powers that want to infiltrate their economy/political process? The very idea of mutually-assured destruction is a deterrent for wrongful behavior, but for some reason a sovereign country isnt allowed to defend itself against that.

Look at Iraq and Libya. As soon as those nuclear armaments were confirmed gone they were invaded under the false pretenses of human rights violations- but then the world turns a blind eye to the fact that the US bombed the shit out of the Libyan people's only resource for water. (That resource was artificially created through great funding through the country's profits from oil sales. They found and tapped into a rare water source in the desert.) Thats a human rights violation in and of itself. Later emails were leaked between US and France demanding Libyas resources. But yeah we destroyed 2 countries for humans rights. Nevermind the millions dead in the middle east and the millions more displaced. /s "
"Sorry, but weren't they ""playing ball"" with the US when they agreed to the Iran Nuclear Deal in the first place? And weren't they ""playing ball"" by following the terms of said deal, despite the US unceremoniously scrapping an international agreement which they had proposed, overseen and agreed to roughly a year previously?

I thought these sanctions were essentially the Trump administration throwing their toys out of the cot and trying to pressure the deal into collapsing without US support?

I was under the impression that Trump withdrew the US from the deal and reinstated sanctions against Iran mostly for political reasons and that Iran is simply continuing the previously discussed and agreed upon deal with the remaining signatories."
"I'm saying the only difference between the legal judgement you're speaking of and the judgement you believe I'm speaking of comes down to enforcement.

In my scenario, opinion judgement doesn't hold any weight behind it because no one can do anything about it. A legal judgement holds weight because it comes with the implication of tangible enforcement. Jurisdiction in terms of legality only exists because of the implication of enforcement. A judge isn't able to apply enforcement ever, I get that, but that doesn't mean his judgement doesn't have jurisdiction over a wide and known area. It's because another department/organization/whatever you want to call it agrees that the judgement emanating from that seat of authority necessitate a tangible form of enforcement. 

In this scenario, the ICJ has authority based on the tangibility of enforcement stemming from the UN. Ignoring the fact that the US will veto any vote as a result of this because of their status on the Security Council, that authority of jurisdiction does not exist outside of the UN's ability to enforce judgement. Being a sound and valid legal judgement or not, the ICJ (and really any court) is all just opinion without the ability to enforce judgement. "
That dismisses the various empires and nations occupying the ME for resources how?
"Anything being cut at the knees by the powers that be are set for failure. Besides Cuba. They wrekt the capitalist powers good, survived through sanctions, and continue to prosper and align themselves with well-meaning parties. You see failure, i see real progress.

"for anyone on reddit to assume they have the slightest clue whats going on behind closed doors and what outside influence is coming into play in any of these political agreements between countries is just asinine. we get it you hate trump and wahhhhh, i don't like him either, but theres too much going on that we are oblivious to have an educated opinion on this matter. thats why im pretty indifferent. "
"If a criminal comits a crime in country A and then runs to country B, then the courts in country A would still have jurisdiction over the case happening in country A. However, the criminal is in country B, making enforcement of the judgement impossible.

In this case the veto right of the US is making enforcement impossible. What you're trying to do is change the meaning of jurisdiction into something else, which it isn't. The ICJ has jurisdiction over the case, but it has no power to enforce the judgement due to US's veto power."
Cuba is probably the last example you should’ve used lmao. My quality of life as a single male veteran living in a shitty apartment is leaps and bounds above the average Cubans quality of life. 
Oh look! “That wasn’t real socialism!” In the wild lmao
"Yeah, it was sarcasm.  I do not think international policy caused an earthquake, but I said it does.

I did so out of criticism of the person I was replying to.  The absolutely disastrous downfall of US public relations during the Trump presidency is obvious and public knowledge; the person I was replying to is a T_D guy, commonly known for a) their tendency to stick their fingers in their eyes and shut their eyes when confronted with facts and reality, and b) their tendency to loooove crazy conspiracy theories about how the US government causes natural disasters, turns frogs gay, etc. etc."
"So we are really gonna play the morality card? What a joke. The US is not the paragon of moral decisions and it wasnt until the new millennia that it passed pro lgbt laws. 

Furthermore Saudi Arabia is a sexist, racist, anti-Semitic (and I don’t mean anti-Zionist, I mean anti-Semitic), absolute theocratic monarchy, yet we still frequently engage in mutual operations with them and support them with arms since, you know, they basically get to play petrol-controller for the US. 

So this whole appeal to morality is moot, seeing as the country hasnt even been allowed to progress with all the infiltration and economic disruption it's had to fend off."
"I have not changed the definition of jurisdiction. Since you've changed the scope of the example: Enforcement is still possible in your scenario through either agreement of extradition OR simply recognizing that the criminal is now in a state of exile. That the person is now an *outlaw* in the classical sense- literally removed from the protection of law. A return to face the consequence of action would remove outlaw status. 

In the case of the ICJ, the UN has in place a system of checks that effectively make any ICJ decision towards any permanent Security Council member unenforceable if the decision is not positive. The UN has made its own judiciary arm redundant."
"They all have jobs, homes, free healthcare, and free education. Which is more than i can say for my neighbors here in the US. 

They are not buried in luxuries like other people in other countries, but a lot of the economic hardships are due to the 50+ year blockade on them, costing them trade opportunities. But they've become self-sufficient and have survived and prospered much more than the american government would have liked. 

Why is it we can have 5 and 8 year recessions/depressions nearly every 10 years, but capitalist mock socialist countries for not being world superpowers while enduring massive blockades for half a century? Thats just being disingenuous."

"It isnt a negotiation. They (US+ other capitalist nations) are economically crippling them. Then trying to force denuclearization by pointing at the economic suffering (caused by their sanctions) and claiming the government is oppressive and funding covert groups to infiltrate political parties (to perpetually keep the state in disarray). By denuclearizing they lose all form of  defense because they cannot assure mutual destruction in case the US ""implies"" force. 

They can't trade effectively because in doing so, the US doesnt get a piece of the petrol pie (all global sales of petrol are in dollars and attempting to do them via other currency angers americans). So they are forced to cripple their economic power by selling in a currency that is miles stronger (propped up by the hegemony) than theirs. They also cannot publicly reveal any research into nuclear armament because that'll prompt invasion under false pretenses. (eg.  ""Soandso is using their nuclear weapons to threaten/oppress/attack  its own people"") or in support 

But if they also allow themselves to be found harboring no weapons, the threat of nuclear assured destruction is gone and it may prompt invasion under other pretenses (aka for not ""playing ball"" and ""oppressing their people"") like what happened in Iraq, Libya and Syria. 

We have left them with no recourse. And that's the entire point. The US and co want to back them into a corner so that they will allow the US to setup bases/world banks/ IMF in their country to help ""build it"". The cost will be so immensely large with obscene interest that the country will not be able to pay. And so now the US has the legal position to reach in and get their resources for cheap. Its a miracle with all the ""USA USA USA"" people here, they have no idea how their government operates. "
"I haven't changed any meaning. You've continuously changed the scope of the example. There's no need to prosecute a dead a person based on the simple fact that he/she is dead. There's plenty of precedent of that exact scenario occurring- where a criminal dies but isn't prosecuted. And I've already offered to you that a person is a literal outlaw is not offered protection by the law. Your refusal to accept that the ICJ is not able to enforce jurisdiction because of the insufficiencies of the UN laws/regulations is not my problem. The ICJ ruling means nothing, the US will stay on the Permanent Security Council, and the only consequence will be that nations will look diplomatically down at US Ambassador Nikki Haley. I'm sure Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, John Bolton, and the rest of the US diplomatic corps to the UN are worried about criminal action taken against them on US soil.

**Police state:**

Hasn't the US been doing this to us for years? 

**Totalitarian** 

>relating to a system of government that is centralized and dictatorial

**Dictatorial**

>of or typical of a ruler with total power.

Is this not what has been happening in america lately? Our presidents are declaring war. Not even asking congress anymore. Just straight up claiming to be willing to use force for whatever political means? Starting war and invasions (like that of Syria) without going through congress.

You can't honestly try to throw labels around and assume i know nothing. You are the one who has no idea wth you're talking about. 

Cuba has arguably one of the richest democratic processes of all of our civilized nations. They dont spy on their people. What they do is keep privately owned media out so that bs propaganda doesnt infiltrate the minds of their young. One could argue that state controlled media is a form of oppression, but if we look at our own media, they are own by the same 6 entities thanks to the telecommunications act under Bill Clinton's presidency. These 6 entities control everything in our media and they are closely aligned with out oligarchic overloards' interests. Further, one could look at the unfortunate moment in history when Socialist Chilean president allowed media to be wholly free (libre) and it  was used to spew lies and incredibly shady/false propaganda against him and his party which aided in the coup against him on september 11, 1973.

So dont talk to me about police states if you have no idea of what the term actually means.

Let's have a chat though? Seriously?

I'm on the West Coast. My city has problems, mainly because too many people want to live here... because it's NICE.  Too many people, not enough dwellings, cost of rent is stupid high, and it's being addressed by local government in a variety of ways. 

The buses run on time, the cops do their job, the roads are ok, and we have minimal corruption. 

West Coast is the Best Coast. 

And, can you take your attitude back a little? I'm trying to have a serious conversation with you, and you're all ""Socialist government tit sucker!"" and it's not really making me want to have a serious conversation with you. 

I'm sorry our city is shitty, but that doesn't automatically mean we should abandon government and live in private enclaves like some Libertarian wet dream. If some cops are crooked, the solution is to get new cops, not get rid of all cops. That's obvious, or should be...

I AM really curious what city you live in. I'm guessing it's not as bad as you think, and I'm guessing they could use your help to make it better...."
"yup, yup"
"the truth is, nobody cares how the government operates. the government won't admit how they really operate, and what their true intentions are. it sounds cold but i could care less about iran. ive got my own problems to worry about than our sanctions and how it effects them, its sounds cold but it is what it is. getting worked up on the internet about it doesn't accomplish anything. work to make yourself a political force to be reckoned with or take it easy. "
"> I haven't changed any meaning.

Yes you have. Because the definition of ""jurisdiction"" doesn't include anything about having the power to execute the punishment.

> You've continuously changed the scope of the example.

I've given different examples, what's wrong with that?

>  There's no need to prosecute a dead a person based on the simple fact that he/she is dead.

Whether there is a need or not doesn't change the fact that it's possible to do so.

> There's plenty of precedent of that exact scenario occurring- where a criminal dies but isn't prosecuted.

Because doing so is a waste of resources in most cases. It's still possible to do so.

> Your refusal to accept that the ICJ is not able to enforce jurisdiction because of the insufficiencies of the UN laws/regulations is not my problem.

Your definition of ""jurisdiction"" doesn't make sense. A court is part of the judicial branch of the government. This means that they're the ones deciding the punishment. It's the executive branch of the government that enforces that punishment.

If having the power to enforce the punishment is part of the definition of jurisdiction, then a court could never have jurisdiction over a case because a court doesn't have the power to punish anyone. This means according to you it can only be a government that has jurisdiction, because only a government has both judicial and executive branch.

All you're doing is trying to twist the meaning of ""jurisdiction"", just google the definition of it and you'll realize that literally none of them talk about any enforcement.

The ICJ has jurisdiction over the case and this is a fact. You're trying to use semantics to change the meaning of a word in order to say that the ICJ doesn't have ""jurisdiction"" over the case, which doesn't make sense at all. I don't understand what your goal is in this discussion?

This is the most detailed definition I've found:

> Power or right of a legal or political agency to exercise its authority over a person, subject matter, or territory. Jurisdiction over a person relates to the authority to try him or her as a defendant. Jurisdiction over a subject matter relates to authority derived from the country's constitution or laws to consider a particular case. Jurisdiction over a territory relates to the geographic area over which a court has the authority to decide cases. Concurrent jurisdiction exists where two courts have simultaneous responsibility for the same case. [Source](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/jurisdiction.html)

Nothing about enforcement."

"It’s houston, this place is a shithole overrun with illegals and staffed by corrupt politicians and police. You can call the cops for an armed robbery and they won’t show up for 2 HOURS. Been there, done that. I’m leaving this place, it constantly reeks of shit and piss and the roads are falling apart. "
I've never defined jurisdiction in any of my comments. You are the only person to have defined the word. I did say many times that jurisdiction comes with the inherent implication of force. The only form of tangibility that gives jurisdiction any form of derived power. The same governing document which allows for jurisdiction lays forth the necessary ability to apply force. The idea that anyone would recognize jurisdiction where it is said to apply without also recognizing that a system of force is there to back it up is extremely unlikely believe the concept of jurisdiction applies. 
"You know not all brown people are illegal, yes? Just checking.... Seriously though...

"Yes I fucking know...I was hit while at at stoplight by a Bulgarian illegal immigrant. I work with an illegal Nigerian and Pakistani immigrant. They’re good people, but they’re also reported to ICE.

"I don't view that as a definition and I'm not sure how you can see it as one. It doesn't explain what jurisdiction is, only that jurisdiction is tied to another action. 

And the discussion is exactly that: the ICJ has no jurisdiction on the US, legal or otherwise, because it has been hampered by the institution which brought about the existence of the ICJ. The US is not the only country that applies to, though. Russia, China, France, and the UK are also not beholden to any of the ICJ rulings for the exact same reason. If the court can't have its rulings enforced then legal opinions don't mean anything. 

**Edit: I'd like to add. Because of the status of Permanent Security Council members, the UNPSC has jurisdiction on the ICJ. "
"> As for the politicians, all politicians are corrupt. End of story.

I have visited my state rep. Tawna Sanchez. She's awesome. She's been over to my house to talk about housing issues. I know she's not corrupt. She'd be driving a MUCH nicer car if she was. :D She also has a tendency to tell leadership to stick it. 

My state senator is... useless. But he's not corrupt. He's just useless. Our local paper has deemed him the most useless senator, it's not just me. But I digress....

I’m an American but I think it’s outrageous that this country believes they have the right to dictate whom sovereign nations can and cannot trade with. Implemented this way, sanctions are nothing but economic warfare.

This is what people do not understand about our sanctions. It’s not simply that we refuse to trade with an individual or nation. We are also forbidding anyone who trades with us to trade with that party."
It might be even more insidious than that... SA (as well as all of OPEC) has wanted to [decouple](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-usa-oil-exclusive/exclusive-saudi-arabia-threatens-to-ditch-dollar-oil-trades-to-stop-nopec-sources-idUSKCN1RH008) from the petro-dollar for some time.

However, I don't agree with the sentiment that sanctions in your own market on a business that makes money through trade that is illicit or deemed illegal is imperialism by any stretch of the imagination.

What of sanctioning companies that say, trade nuclear weapons materials with North Korea?

Beyond that, does the United States not have the right to control and regulate it's own markets and banks?

Imperialism has nothing to do with countries regulating their own internal markets, no matter now dumb or misguided those regulations are.

"American imperialism is bad.  Most of us younger folk want to stop it: libertarians, democrats, some conservatives, etc.  Imperialism is anti\-conservative and anti\-liberal.

Some people don't know this but a lot of us \(not myself\) voted for Trump because he condemned involvement in Libya, Iraq, and Syria.  He blamed Obama's meddling for creating ISIS.  Clinton was branded as the corrupt warmonger who wanted to make enemies with Russia and bring us closer to WWIII.  Trump's isolationist policies appeared to reduce US meddling, arms dealing, and war for profit.  It surprises me when Europeans don't know Obama's \(who I voted for twice\) track record with foreign wars.

Actually, Trump really hasn't done much at all yet in terms of attacking other countries with force.  He somehow made peace with North Korea.  Strategic sanctions are fine by me as long as it prevents people from dying.

Iran is not a good country.  They're a theocracy that denies the holocaust and openly seeks to destroy Israel with nuclear weapons. Trump is saying we don't need to pamper them, just force them to stop.  He's not wrong, it's just a hard approach.  There's no reason to reward Iran for NOT working towards nuking Israel, it's just the safest option.  That rubs some Americans the wrong way, like fuck that, why are we giving into terrorist demands?

Iran cares about military independence and power because not even a generation go, almost the entire world was so adamant to destroy it that they rallied behind Saddam, supporting him directly and indirectly as he waged a bloody 8-year war against Iran. Not even his war crimes wavered their support. Why should Iran trust they wouldn't do it again?"
Probably because they are worried about most of the countries surrounding them and the US starting a war with them.
"Because their military threat is the only reason they still exist. The US would have wiped then it years ago if not for it. Additionally, every country has the right to have a military, at least as long as America is going around invading (directly or indirectly) every country it can."

All this talk of a new world order yet everyone is just as bar off as the United States if not worse.

Do you really think Iran is worth throwing everything away for? Iran, the country that can't stop itself from funding terrorism even when their well-being depends on it. Iran, the country that can't stop screaming death to the west even when the west is trying to give it badly needed aid. Iran, the country that can't stop playing the villain even when the world is trying to give them a second chance ad their enemies Saudia Arabia and Israel lose favor. Even if the nuclear agreement was successful  Iran has openly stated that they have no interest in expanding it to cover the real points of contention. Iran has no love for Europe or the west and this move to align with a rogue state after it attacked Israel is as baffling as it is frightening. "

Just to be clear, I hated the Iran deal and I'm glad it's gone. 

That said, Obama did indeed have authority to lift sanctions unilaterally because it was expressly written in at the time when sanctions were put into place against Iran by the Republican-led Congress.

But here's the other catch is that the sanctions were entirely due to Iran funding terror and their human rights violations. The sanctions had nothing to do with nuclear activities. What Barry should have done was commit Iran to clean up its act and only lift sanctions then as part of the deal, which would have given us a basis to hold them accountable to. We didn't do that. We gave up everything even though we were in a position of power and asked nothing of real consequence in return.

If I'm selling shoes in country A where red shoes are not allowed, and red shoes in country B where they're allowed, on what basis can country A punish me for selling red shoes in a country where they are legal ? On a legal standpoint, this bypass international law. Politically it denies the sovereignty of the other country's laws.  

Now of course countries can regulate their own market, the US actually tried to do this with imports of steel, but faced an international anger, and then discovered other countries could do the exact same thing. But it's totally fine.

For the rest, of course I agree with you, Iran is not a good country, but a full scale invasion is impossible, forcing them to do anything will drive crazy crazier, and destroying them will pave the way for monsters even crazier. But building trust and dialogue over decades is something that might prevent them from going from nutcases to completely out\-of\-control ISIS\-style mad dogs \(I'm talking about the people leading Iran, not iranian themselves\).

"> Iran is not a good country. They're a theocracy that denies the holocaust and openly seeks to destroy Israel with nuclear weapons.

One president denied the holocaust, not the whole country. 

Also, how can you claim they want to destroy Israel with nuclear weapons when they have no nuclear weapons, they never had a real program to devlop nuclear weapons and the made a international deal that would make producing nuclear weapons almost impossible. 

Iran unlike Israel is and has been for a long time a signatory NPT. Israel is nuclear rough state who hides hides their illigal nuclear weapons.

> Trump is saying we don't need to pamper them, just force them to stop. 

Again? Stop what? They never had a real program and even the Israeli can't even find the slightes evidence that they cheated on the deal.

> There's no reason to reward Iran for NOT working towards nuking Israel, it's just the safest option.

I'm sorry but what are you talking about? What 'reward' did Iran get? Iran gave up a lot and mainly what they got is that the world would not continue economic warfare against them. This was the stick, not the carrot.

> That rubs some Americans the wrong way, like fuck that, why are we giving into terrorist demands?

A complet misinterpretation of events. Iran has the right, like any nation that signed the NPT, to have civilian nuclear program. They didn't want to devlop it themselfs and planned to buy it from France. The US objected and made sure France blocked the sale.

Then Iran started devloping its own program and the Israel/US threatend war against them to make them stop.

So what terrorist demands are you talking about?

"
"> They're a theocracy that denies the holocaust and openly seeks to destroy Israel with nuclear weapons

Im glad you brought this up, since you know, one has hundreds of nuclear weapons while the other is a signatory NPT. Its unbelievable people actually think this way despite logic suggesting otherwise. One has the capability to launch nukes and level entire cities, the other does not. I doubt Iran would even need nukes to eventually run over Israel after a long drawn out war of attrition.

"As a European who despises Trump, my impression during the election was that Trump was running on the platform of peace (disengagement from international affairs), whereas Clinton was the business as usual candidate (in terms of foreign policy).

I don't think that ended up being the case though. The Iran deal was the peaceful solution to this mess and Trump backed down from it. From what I've read about the situation, the moderate Iranian faction in favour of the Iran deal will cede power to the hardliners now that their progress has been annulled."
"Its quite sad that you need to continue to state how you arent a supporter. It's ok to agree with something that the President is doing, even if you didn't vote for him. 

I support a lot of the stuff that Trump is doing, but I hate how he behaves like a twat waffle. I didn't like a lot of Obama's policies, but i liked how he represented the US, in behavior. It's ok to like what trump is doing. You don't have to caviat it with ""I'm not a supporter""."

"Painting it as the West giving Iran and is disingenuous at best. The only reason Iran needs ""aid"" (which is actually just sanction relief) is because we blacklisted then after they overthrew the dictator we put in power. What you're essentially saying is that Iran deserves what they get because they didn't want to live under a dictator anymore. I'm not going to defend the ayotollah, but to deny that Iran is not more Democratic now than it was when the shah was in charge is idiotic. Obviously, the correct move would have been too leave them alone and not put in a theocratic dictator, but we had to protect BP's profits. They would probably still have a secular government if that had been allowed.

"Well, first of all even if the US thought one thing and everyone else thought different then who gives a shit? We don't make policy based on the feelings of people, let alone the feelings of people in other countries.

Second, get something and build on that?  If it's a shitty deal it's a shitty deal.  Obama's legacy was written in with a pen and an executive order which assures it can be undone with a pen and an executive order."
Then stop relying on us.

Blame the americans that voted for Trump, not me."
"Look, the whole deal was a huge bribe to Iran for them to stop enriching Uranium. It's really like someone blackmailing you and telling you that they're going to do something bad unless you give them money. We gave them money so that they wouldn't destabilize the region any further with nuclear weapons. 

In a way, they kept their promise and didn't enrich uranium above the allotted amount. However, they've slowly expanded their presence in Lebanon, Yemen, and Syria. Their missile program has also grown tremendously. 

There were pretty massive demonstrations right after the announcement from Trump about pulling out of the deal. They chanted ""death to America"" and burned our flags. It's pretty evident that they're a hostile nation and we shouldn't be making any deals which benefit them.

As far as European leaders being concerned, they know that they can't do jack shit by themselves, thus they need the US to help lead any sort of a deal. They can keep threatening to get closer to Russia to make partnership with them, but Russia already has most of Europe by its balls. All they have to do is threaten to cut off the natural gas supply in the winter time.

If Iran continues to be hostile, they'll get sanctions and their economy will go to shit. It's that simple. "

Renault is actually impacted because of the Renault-Nissan alliance. PSA on the other end might very well choose to stay in Iran and never comme back to the US.

As for Renault I assume they refer to the Renault Group which does more than just cars.. for example RCI Bank is part of that group.  Not sure how much business they do in the US though. "

">I'll have to disagree with you. A nation has its own sovereign laws that apply to its own soil. 

These are U.S. laws that apply only to U.S. banks.

What you are proposing is a restriction of Governments to regulate their own banks and monetary system, if they commit crimes that do not occur on the terroritory of that country, and that is frankly ridiculous.

These laws inform U.S. banks that they cannot deal with organizations that participate in activity deemed illegal by the United States.

Would you have the same position if the company say trafficked in child sex slavery, or sold nuclear materials to ISIS?

Companies and countries that do not want to  be effected by U.S. laws do not have to deal in U.S. markets. 

> Applying one country's laws to another territory breaks in effect the sovereignty of the other country. 

But other countries have the soverignty to not  use the U.S banking system, or deal with U.S. companies.

You are proposing a restriction on sovereignty, not the opposite.

>If I'm selling shoes in country A where red shoes are not allowed, and red shoes in country B where they're allowed, on what basis can country A punish me for selling red shoes in a country where they are legal ? 

How does it bypass international law?

Country A can make whatever laws it wants with regards to it's own markets.

I constantly see this hypocritical stance taken by Russia and China, that make enormous internal regulations and punitive actions not against just coporations, but entire countries that recognize Taiwan, or individuals that visit with the Dalai Lama.

For instance the Russian federation requires all data for Russian citizens the world over to be first installed on Russian servers. This means any Russian citizen, operating in any country, anywhere.

Their mechanism for enforcing this is taking punitive action towards companies that do not follow these data retention policies when they operate within the Russian federation.

It makes no difference if the person is in the US or any other country at the time.

My company rightfully follows this data retention policy with respect to Russian citizens, because we want to operate in Russia.

>Now of course countries can regulate their own market, the US actually tried to do this with imports of steel, but faced an international anger, and then discovered other countries could do the exact same thing. But it's totally fine.  

It seems like you agree with me then. 

My point is sanctions are just market based regulations and penalties, and other countries are capable of (and do) levy similar regulations and penalties on U.S companies in their own markets based on their own internal laws, and have the right and sovereignty to do so.

>But punishing via an unilateral legal system people for not following through what they decided is bullying national sovereignty, and blackmailing nations.

It is definitely bullying and blackmail, but it's not imperialism. And often it's used to great and positive effect, like the EU levying penalties against Google for monopolistic practices, or doing the same against African War Lords, or countries like Eritrea or North Korea that hold their citizens in virtual slavery.

I've traveled the world, many continents worth for many years. The world has felt this way about the US for a very long time. Even those who like us, still think we are all misguided at best. Even as many countries come to us for help on just about every situation you can think of. Nothing much has changed, just the level of outspokenness. Obama went around the world apologizing and more importantly hell bent on telling everyone that we are all equal.. well, we are not and that's just reality folks. 

> but a full scale invasion is impossible

The US already has the battle plans drawn up, coordinates for every building in the entire country, flight paths for it's pilots, elevation and mapping data, moon light studies, supply lines and SOPs, medical deployment workups, intel on all military bases, arm cache sites, bridges, roads, power lines, gas lines.. do I need to go on?

"The enrichment of uranium, even for direct use in nuclear reactors as a power source, is a causal factor for developing nuclear weapons.  The two are inseparable.  That is why the US is all over any country who suddenly decides to enrich uranium or to create the machines which perform this task.  And for countries which do successfully develop nuclear power plants, in short, the byproducts used to create nuclear weapons may be collected to eliminate the risk of these weapons being developed.  [Japan has tons of plutonium](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/opinion/japans-plutonium-problem.html) which can be used to make thousands of warheads, they just decide not to do so.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear\_power#Nuclear\_proliferation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power#Nuclear_proliferation)

Indeed, Ahmadinejad threatened to ""wipe Israel off the map,"" and just one month ago an Iranian general said the same.  Ahmadinejad was a Holocaust denier and he was able to proclaim this openly because people in Iran agree with him.  If they didn't then he wouldn't say it.  They think Jews are subhuman.  It's just like when Trump bans Muslim travel, there are people in the US who agree with him.  It's irrational to say otherwise.

So there you go, a government which recently developed high\-range missiles, and who wants to ""wipe Israel off the face of the map,"" is in perfect position to do so if they are allowed to use nuclear power without the plutonium being collected.

Israel has behaved responsibly with their nuclear weapons. They have not threatened to wipe anyone off the face of the map.  It's completely different."

"Believe me, I know exactly how nuclear energy works.

Yes, knowlage of one is important for the other, but no nation has devloped nuclear bombs from nuclear power plants. All nations that have both have started with nuclear weapons and then made use of it to produce energy.

All nuclear experts agree that it is pretty dumb and useless to use modern nuclear power plants to produce weapons materials. No nation has ever taken that path and no nation will. If you want nuclear materials then making a plan to take it out of commercial reactor that is monitored is about the dumbest possible plan.

Iran had been willing to buy these reactors from France and France would have had full view of the whole fuel cycle in order to make sure that this was not used for anything else. Iran was at that time and since also abserved under the NPT. If there was still any credible worry, for a deal with the US Iran would have adopted the extend protocol as well (as they latter did in the Obama deal).

Under this arrangment Iran would not even have devloped the capability to make weapons grade materials but the US of course blocked it anyway.

Please learn something about the history of Iran and Israel. For the most part the nations were frindly for a long time, even until the late 1980. We do actually have data about public opinion and the Iranian people don't have a really strong opinion on Israel, far less then Arabs. Most experts also agree that the Iranian elites as a whole are not perticularly anti-semitic. There is not really a true idiological thread, depending on the politics of the day the play the thread up and down on both sides. 

Ahmadinejad is guy with a big mouth that was put foreward by the regimn to scare the west and make the west think that Iran is crazy. He said stupid and crazy stuff for the same reason Trump says stupid stuff. Its simple populist politics. 

> So there you go, a government which recently developed high-range missiles, and who wants to ""wipe Israel off the face of the map,"" is in perfect position to do so if they are allowed to use nuclear power without the plutonium being collected.

Please learn how nukes work. You can't simply stick the plutonium from the reactor waste stream on a bomb and fire it. It requires a siginifacnt amount of further work that is very difficult to hide. Also, all these materials would be continuly monitored by the IAEA.

Also, Saudi Arabia has said they would take the war into Iran. If you think Iran is not allowed to have missiles because of what they said, why are the Saudis allowed?

Iran need missiles for defense, as has been proven in the Iran-Iraq war where they were hit by missiles and were unable to do anything. This included chemical gas attacks on civilian.

How can you argue that they don't have a credible argument for defensive missile threat when they are surounded by powers, some hostile, who all have these missiles. 

> Israel has behaved responsibly with their nuclear weapons. They have not threatened to wipe anyone off the face of the map. It's completely different.

The have not threatend anybody because they have not admited offically that they have them. However the implicit thread is totally clear.

Having secret nuclear weapons is totally against the spirit of the international community and ever nation other then Israel would face sanction and pushback.

... you are a lost cause. Forever.
"you must be an idiot to believe that Israel is somehow good in this conflict/war that has been going on because Israelis allow people to settle into Palestinians lands and then forcefully STONE them to make them leave. Not the Palestinians doing the stoning bud. They may throw rocks at the soldiers because that is all they got, its so easy to see who the agressor is with their powerful artillery. They use it to their advantage and kill innocent people, just look at the body count. Israel may not shout it publicly but don't be fooled they already have caused bankruptcies and deaths of millions around the world."
"I'm not disagreeing, but you can't ignore the base issue."
"How do you ""work up"" when Iran has pointedly stated that they refuse to work up? "
"Have hope! The idiot you are replying too does not represent all of us Americans. The majority of us support the Iran deal. We can and must vote Trump out, re-take congress and set us back on the right path."
The entire world doesn't support the Iran deal.  Stop being delusional.
"You realize I agreed with you on the nuclear part right? The deal was a terrible one because it didn't include anything about not developing long range missiles, not supporting terrorist groups and not getting trying to destabilize the area. 

Iran is backing Houthis in Yemen.
Iran is backing and created the Hezbollah in Lebanon. 
Iran is backing the al-Assad regime. They're supporting terrorism in its true definition.

Why should we lift sanctions on a country that constantly goes against us in everything?"
Source of what? Everything I listed is common knowledge if you follow the world news at all. 
"that phrase is correct, Soviet blood, British intelligence, and US supplies.

emphasis on Soviet Blood, millions of their own fought and died to beat back the Nazis, the turning point of the war was at stalingrad.
and the Soviets were the ones that took Berlin.

the US was content with letting Europe tear itself into pieces, until the japs attacked.
thats when they were forced to join in, almost 3 yrs into the war.

the average american today thinks the war was won solely because of the US.
you can blame ''we're number 1'' mentality on that, not to mention movies such as Saving private ryan, that glorified US soldiers only.
not one mainstream hollywood mention of Soviets carrying the heavy lifting.

you can blame games like COD for it as well, it has been an absolute propaganda machine since the 50's.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11590755/Poll-US-did-more-than-UK-and-USSR-to-defeat-Nazi-Germany.html
thats just one poll, and most of those americans got their historical facts wrong.

the US did play a big role, but not the decisive role, that one goes to the Soviets.
you may not like Soviets/Russians, and thats perfectly fine, but we also cannot deny historical facts."
"US and the entirety of the EU have roughly the same GDP around 18 trillion usd, while the EU has almost 200 million more citizens. Considering how only the top 4 individual economies in the EU have to prop up countries like Greece that drag the economy down, I could see it go either way."

They were there are our birth, and when we grew up we saved them in their greatest hour of darkness. There's no basis for superiority on those claims alone. "

"> The EU is way too volatile for the Euro to be a standardized currency.

And the RMB is wholly subject to the whims of a non-transparent regime. 

>But of course then you'd have to deal with china's bad habit of making up economic numbers,

This isn't something to understate - this is a huge problem.

I don't think there's a snowball's chance the RMB becomes the defacto currency adopted by European trade. Moreover, I don't think that's something China would want because it would inflate the value of their currency and potentially loosen their control over it's valuation.
"
"True, honestly the power of the president needs to be better regulated for both parties in power, especially with the hyperpartisan nature of politics recently because we are going to deal with this same shit when the next administration takes over."
So what?
again... i am not trusting iran.No country should have  nuke. BUT iran through its proxy protected our border from Isis while US and KSA backed them... 
"The choice isn't about Iran and China cal U.S., it's about Iran.

"He didn't get it approved by congress, he abused his powers."
The US congressional map from the 2016 election.
"Historically treaties are something congress agrees to. Since they they didn’t obama went and did whatever on his own with his limited power. 

So no. It wasn’t the word of the US. It was he word of Barack Obama. Who doesn’t speak for the whole US government."
of course its not a solution. But it was an improvement. How is it that Iran building nuclear weapons now is better than Iran not doing it until 2030 (with 15 years of trust built between the two sides)?
"well said. Everyone is so up for a war with Iran (even though most people in the USA probably can't find Iran on the map.) And most people don't seem to understand going to war with them would be bad for Everyone. Iraq is still fucked after 15 years of war and a trillion dollars, same with Afghanistan and Iran wouldn't be any different. Also they didn't break any of the deal, but Hawks be Hawking. Sad and most people are just jumping on the Fuck Iran bandwagon without knowing any details. Just remember who gave them their nuclear technology.............. 
The West."
The wonders of american education 😂
What? 
"Never heard anyone say ""the USA""?

Really because I recall a song about a guy being born there."
So your solution is to continue supporting the number 1 funder of terrorism in the world. Let them have nukes to use on Isreal and Britain too I assume. No we will kill them rest assured. You could go to Iran and join the revolutionary guard if you felt so strongly. Then you could put your rifle where your mouth is and kill some Jews. You’d like that right?

"""India first tested a nuclear device in 1974 \(code\-named ""Smiling Buddha""\), under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which it called a ""peaceful nuclear explosion."" The test used plutonium produced in the Canadian\-supplied CIRUS reactor, and raised concerns that nuclear technology supplied for peaceful purposes could be diverted to weapons purposes. This also stimulated the early work of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. India performed further nuclear tests in 1998 \(code\-named ""Operation Shakti""\). In 1998, as a response to the continuing tests, the United States and Japan imposed sanctions on India, which have since been lifted.""

It is still to early to tell what will happen to the deal.
Iran fired on the Golan Heights first via Syria. Israel fired back at Iran via Syria. The timeline is easily verifiable so please show me where Irans actions were retaliatory and when Israel bombed them before the attack on Golan Heights.
You have no proof and you cast my sources aside without even attempting to argue a point? Macron has the same approval rating as Trump does at 40% even though he started off much higher. I'll even [add a fucking source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.france24.com/en/20180323-france-macron-popularity-record-low-strikes-reform) instead of just talking out my ass. 
Says the anti semite. Be gone
"Resorting to petty name\-calling and not arguing a point is a very strange way of trying to convince me that you're right. 

For your point on Israeli forces stoning Palestinians, there seems to be no evidence of it made public enough for it to be seen as legitimate. The only thing I could find was an article about the similarities between Palestinian Stone\-Throwers and the Israeli Jews who used a similar tactic in the late forties.

Come to me with an argument, or an acceptance that you were wrong."
"right, they refuse to work up and following the already agreed deal to not create nukes, right."
"Other then Israel, has any country come out in support of withdrawing from the agreement?"
People just want a source for your claims.
Ah I see. No source then.
[removed]
"What is with all the assumptions?  Seriously, stop accusing me of things with no basis.

You are correct, that was one poll.  One poll where most countries, it should be noted, answered the same way Americans did.  (Edit to add:  which doesn’t mean any of them were right, but it’s not nice making it sound like it’s just Americans in a faulty poll giving poor responses).

I do not feel the same way as whoever was polled, and was not taught the same way.

I don’t know anyone that believes movies or video games are a great source for historic reference.

I have no idea where the idea of me disliking Russians came from.  I’m curious where I’ve denied historic facts as well.

Basically, if you’re trying to come across as a condescending twat who decided to get preachy with someone that actually agrees with you...you succeeded."
You're right that its similarly sized but that's like saying that Mexico would obey the EU over the US - the geographical reality is such that the US simply cannot be as relevant to France as the EU is right now.
"Interesting how it’s approved and funny here to make fun of abused children, but poke fun at another country besides the US or Israel (or show support for them) and you get attacked."
"no not really, im not French, im just sick of bullshit spouted by people that have no clue of what they are talking about.

an argument grounded on factual truths is not equal to the ''lel, france surrender''  argument, one is a baseless opinion, the other isnt.

"King Louis XVI: ""Aiding the Americans in their bid for independence can only serve us in the long run!""

Ron Howard:  ""It didn't."""
"Or ""properly"" as we'd say."
"so the USA will be perceived as an unreliable country when it comes to agreements. It will make it harder to enter agreements with other countries. Which is a big change from how the USA usually acts, and is likely to alienate a lot of its close allies."
"It's not about just Iran. All companies who deal with Iran will get sanctioned and all companies who deal with those companies will get sanctioned too. Chinese, German and French firms invested in Iran are determined to work there so that means they will get sanctioned. And anyone doing business with them will get the same. How will our governments respond? Even if I do make the choice to go with the US, what's to guarantee that I won't be crippled with tariffs by next month? It's a delicate cobweb, you mess with one strand and whole thing comes down."
"If it was a choice to make without looking at political implications, yes. However in this case there is also the problem of Trump's America not upholding her deal and repeatedly treating her allies like a doormat. 

At some points those allies are going to say ""enough"" and seek others partners. We're seeing that shift starting to happens now but it could have been anywhere past this point. 
As for CEOs, they are going to adapt. For example if during the course of Trump's mandate they see he is quick to draw the sanction / trade war gun and point it on allies when he is contradicted or they refuse to do what he wants, they are simply going to come to the conclusion that US has become a riskier market than before and that investing there carry important risks for the future."
"so its money the problem...my bad i though it was the ""nukes"".."
"I think enough of the world is tired of it that if the US gave it up, the UN would actually serve its purpose. We've unilaterally obstructed peaceful resolutions to the violence in the Middle East for decades. We're the only superpower, we could decide to be on the right side of history if we wanted. "
"That's not a citation, that's a non sequitur."
"The rest of the world isn't going to care much about that part. Just the fact that a deal is being walked away from that they made with the USA.

The kicker is there was no real reason to walk away from it."
"The end result will be Iran without nuclear weapons forever, so this is a much needed improvement"

"by number 1 funder of terrorism you  meant KSA right ?  as a christian Lebanese who is just stuck in a proxy war between saoudians and Iran , the Hezbollah \(iranian\) and Lebanese Army were defending the border from ISIS \(saudians\)... so yea but you will not see this on Fox News :\)"
"Now hang on a second there lol. #1 Funder of Terrorism remains KSA. They are the ones spreading Jihadism and Wahabism and all well-known terror organisations like ISIS, Taliban, Boko Haram, Al-Shabab, Al-Qaeda are Wahabi (Except Hezbollah who are Shia). KSA funds and builds Wahabi mosques all over the world to propagate their ideology and create more Jihadist. And how many times do we have to tell you? Iranians are not making nukes. All three European agencies, IAEA say so. We trust them better than communiques coming from Jeddah and Tel Aviv. And why would I want to join the Revolutionary Guard? I don't want a war at all. Given how much you want it, I suppose you will be the first one to volunteer for the frontline? And as for killing Jews, Jews in Iran are doing okay (Not ideal but okay, they even have their MPs). How many Jews are in KSA? And how are other religions doing in KSA? It's the funniest thing. Suddenly, KSA is the champion of the Jewish people for Israel and US right wing. KSA stands against everything that we hold dear. Just because they need our help against Iran doesn't make them nice people."
"> So your solution is to continue supporting the number 1 funder of terrorism in the world

I mean sure, that's true, if you only consider terrorism as people who receive money from Iran."
Why are you so damn salty? You're really going to debate that the US and UK weren't the driving force behind liberating France? Get your attitude checked.
"Correct.  So not only is the US saying they won't do business with Iran, but they'll punish anyone who does, even though the US is breaking the agreement and not the Iranians."
"Yes, they can, but other countries will see it as:

> But punishing via an unilateral legal system people for not following through what they decided is bullying national sovereignty, and blackmailing nations.

A quote from Dirty Mike and the boyd"
Already been told mate.
"http://time.com/5270362/israel-attacked-syria-trump-iran-deal/

"Popularity poll mean jackshit (especially in France) but if you have a source that Macron doesn't have footing in the parliament, I'd LOVE to see it. "
"So your totally disregarding the bombardment of Palestinians, the videos online which first hand describe the assault on Palestinians from Jewish Settlers. You also say there is no evidence made public, this is exactly why the Israeli govt. made it punishable to record soldiers shooting people. They don't want it public so people like you think it doesn't happen."
"Nukes aren't the be all and end all. Obama and the rest of the world gave Iran a ludicrously good deal on nuclear disarmament in the hopes of luring them into greater peace agreement and tying their economies into the greater world community. As of the signing of the nuclear agreement Iran has shut down all talk of further peace agreements and increased hostility on every single possible front with little to no provocation while still screaming death to the west.

Even if the nuclear agreement was working Iran's recalcitrance has proven that there will be no further compromise as they continue to attack Israel and foment instability in the middle east. "

"I think the bottom line is the United States could’nt care less whether or not the Arab nation are hungry or happy or healthy. If their country laying in ruins serves the purpose of keeping them from attacking America that’s their choice. The people of Iran have a choice. Rise up and possibly die overthrowing the mullah or certainly die fighting the United States. We don’t care. We’ll be just fine. Really the world would be a better place if those countrys ate dirt for the next few hundred years while the civilized world advances around them. You ever been over there?

"yet it was the bombing 1 hour after the deal was dropped by the US which prompted the attack by iran - at this point it's so far back that each attack is the result of another

I don't really like Iran, I also don't like them owning nukes - now they may actually obtain them since from an international stand point there is nothing we can do without this deal.

And when they have nukes and Israel and Iran and still throwing rocks at one another, who benefits again?"
"I am, yes. Thank you."
"You stated your idiotic case, rife with inaccuracies. Even at the start you claim the US joined ""3 yrs into the war"" even though the US joined 2 years into the war, which was 6 months after the Soviets joined (after the Soviets already invaded and annexed many parts of Europe while supporting the Nazis). You stated your case about that? Not at all. Keep spreading bad history and trash opinions."
"I know that the U.S. and France have has a healthy relationship, by and large, and it has benefited both. It's all in good fun.

"Well sadly that era seems to be over. Trump is making clear that, to him, his real friends are Israel and Saudi Arabia. Since the start of his mandate, Europe has received nothing but scorn, contempt, repeated humiliations and threats from him. At a point, yes they're going to take their chance elsewhere. The fact the cracks are over iran is not even relevant here. it could have been anything at this point. it was the last straw that break the camel's back. 

Also you paint Iran as a fundamentalist dictatorship, which is true, but you seem to forget you're allied to an even worse one : Saudi Arabia. We're talking about a country who has been actively propagating and funding violent Wahabism all over the globe for decades now. ISIS ideology comes from them. A country that is also likely to have had a hand in 9/11, that behead dissidents and homosexuals after torturing them.

Iran is bad yes but holy shit, Saudi Arabia is much, much worse."
"The issue is that the US has shown itself to be unreliable in international politics.  Congress is largely apathetic, choosing to foist international dealings onto the executive branch, which means an international deal can be bombed every few years with little to no warning.

Anyways, your ignorance and bias aside, And what choice? What you're saying is blackmail. ""Fight your state or we will fight you"", that's no choice at all. When threatened by an external enemy, even the most divided nations get behind their leadership. What would you do if let's say EU+China+Russia sent you a message ""Either overthrow Trump or die fighting against us""? You will sure as hell tell us to go bugger ourselves and bring it on. And since we are talking about overthrowing governments, why don't you Americans want Saudis, UAE, Bahrainis etc to overthrow their governments?"

Like his analogy totally holds up. Other countries will see this as an attempt of bullying. When you leave a deal and then a few hours latter give big companies from other countries 3 to 6 months to leave and cut their loses. Then those countries will see it as bullying and they might answear in kind.

Because it is also a privilege to be able to do business in Germany, France, China, Sweden, Italy and so on.

"> At a point, yes they're going to take their chance elsewhere. 

Why elsewhere? Europe is perfectly capable of becoming a third pole of power in her own right. Europe's got both the technological and financial means to increase the European military power and soft power. That's why I agree wholeheartedly with Merkel's sentiments that Europe can no longer rely on US and must take her destiny in her own hands. Only reason Europe's avoided large military spendings is because why bother? The Need for a European Military alliance (No NATO does not count) was never so sorely felt as it is today."
"I’m not sure what scorn and contempt you’re referring to, though I agree that the trump administration is abrasive. But to jump from that to ‘US doesn’t consider Europeans as allies’ is quite the logical leap. 

I guess there’s a sense of realpolitik here, The Europeans have found a high horse to ride on and are using it to push through their agenda while possibly also weakening US standing. Not sure how well that’ll play out for them - time will tell. 

As for KSA vs Iran - if we put aside the pejoratives, KSA is seemingly easier to control/contain than Iran is. Perhaps the Europeans are betting on the Iranian horse in the Middle East and choose to feed it, but It’s a Pandora’s box that they may not be able to close. "
"Who lied about the nukes? the US, the EU, and the IAEA are all in agreement that Iran had a military nuclear program. 

The rest of your comment is just a meaningless word salad. I’m not American nor a trump supporter, but you seem to have serious trigger issues. "
"I'm fully aware of that, but I still wouldn't want the UN to be regarded as the last word.

People seem to forget that Iran signed the NPT and that the reason JCPOA even came into being is because they breached it. 

The EU didn't care that Iran breached the NPT until some 'strong\-man' coerced them into forcing JCPOA on Iran. 

This whole kerfuffle is a result of nations unwilling to coordinate and take action against those in breach of treaties.  "
"* Making international agreements without the consent of congress = good guy
* Reinforcing the constitutional limits of the office of the presidency = bad guy

Yeah, totally Trump's fault - not the guy who promised something he shouldn't and couldn't promise."

"I was assuming we were still talking about college kids by ""literally everyone"". I don't think anyone is gonna argue college isn't expensive and puts people in debt. You're suggesting that these kids at the age of 18 knowingly put themselves in debt to go to college. They do so on the advice and, often times, pressure of \(I'm assuming\) your generation. Because for parents, going to college = good job, house, life, etc. Unfortunately, people aren't making these kids aware that college isn't what it used to be at an early enough age. 

You said it earlier: ""it's not hard to stay out of debt. You graduate HS, get a job, get better jobs and move your way up the food chain while not living above your means.. that's it"". This is all true. Problem is, kids don't find this out until after they've paid $30k for a degree and have little job prospects. 

So I agree with you, staying out of debt \(if you ignore unfortunate circumstances and poor luck\) follows basic principles. However, your assertion that ""9/10 choose to put themselves in debt"" is silly. It sounds like things have worked out for you, but a lot of people who struggle with debt from college don't even know they're SOL until they're up to their waist in the red because they were never advised properly in high school."

"if trustworthiness is a thing, then isn't it an issue that the USA just pulled out of a commitment they made vis a vis Iran?"
Dude - What? You think major companies don't have supply chain managers tracking everything and evaluating the financial costs of this shit?
"I'm sorry but on Saudi Arabia You're really mistaken. Or, rather we have very different perception. I know American people have a mostly positive view on SA... in Europe this is very very different.
We have problem with wahabi islamist here. For example new radical mosques being funded and when you trace back the money it always come from... Saudi Arabia.  Iran is a shitty regime but they keep largely to themselves. Saudi Arabia on the other hand is exporting its brand of violent wahabism everywhere from the ME to west Asia, Africa, Oceania, Europe. Not so much in USA.

Personally I have always been baffled at that relation between US and SA. It has stayed cordial throughout the years even though SA has been actively funding many groups and terrorists ennemies to US and , like I said, had probably a hand in 9/11 as well.
To me SA is the living illustration of the saying "" with allies like these, who need ennemies?""

So no I don't think Europeans are just betting on another horse here. As I see it they are not at all trying to be ally with iran ( way too many differences ) but they don't want Iran to become too weak and out of the picture either. They don't like at all the prospect of a Saudi Arabia getting rid of its historical rival in the middle east and basically becoming a new hegemon of the region.
In that regard what Trump is trying to do looks very dangerous to many Europeans. Lastly, we look at new wars in the Middle east very wearily because each time there are refugees that inevitably come flooding in Europe. 
That's another point of contention : when we see US start new wars in the middle East, it looks to us as they're being reckless because they don't care, after all US is very far away and separated by a whole Ocean. Europe is not. Those are thing happening next door that are going to affect us sooner or later. "
""" that Iran had a military nuclear program "" .....have or had ? if ""have"" let the United Nations decide... If had , i dont see the problem here other than warmongering bullshit...  I guess iran and Europe/Rest of the world respected their part of the deal.. and now based on god knows what intelligence the Israelis presented on a cheap ass PPT with the blessing of the saoudians \( best democracy EVER\),  Trump decides to get out of the deal AND  unashamedly  decides to put sanctions on countries dealing with iran just because he cant deal with iran himself... "
"he didn't have to kill it. So yes, Trump takes the blame. Because he did it.

If he had wanted to he could have gotten it ratified himself and taken credit for it. 

For a guy who is trying to get a nuclear deal with North Korea going, you'd think he'd want to preserve a deal that kept Iran from getting weapons."
"I don't want to support a terrorist state.  It's why i want to stop putting up with the US's shit.  And declaring who another country can do business with or you'll punish them is very imperialistic, even if you think it's the US's ""right""."
"> They do so on the advice and, often times, pressure of (I'm assuming) your generation. 

Very true. There is good reason to go to college, but many in my generation are flawed in allowing or persuading their children to go to school for something that won't produce income after graduation. Also, allowing their kids to go to school in places they simply can't afford while there *are* affordable options out there. The other aspect is that many parents don't see the problems in their kids early enough to know that places like UF have a 41% dropout rate. College has become a finishing school/half way house for the real world for lazy parenting. 

> Problem is, kids don't find this out until after they've paid $30k for a degree and have little job prospects.

Very true again.. Well, that is the average millennial debt, but the actual college debt is a much higher sub set. 

> However, your assertion that ""9/10 choose to put themselves in debt"" is silly

Is it? Credit card debt, student loans, car payments and home mortgages are the top categories for millennials being in debt.. actually, that sort of the same for previous generations, different order sometimes, but same categories. 

The average millennial makes $35,000 a year? (Was surprised by this). So, at some point, someone either didn't do the math to figure out they can't afford that car, that college, that x,y,z or ignored the fact for a later day.

Anecdotally, I mentioned UF earlier; I visited my daughter there several times. I was amazed by the amount of high end stores, restaurants, apartments in the area. Couldn't help but think, there's no way a college kid could afford to eat or shop at these places.. but everywhere we went, we were the only parents and the rest was college students paying with credit cards. I often viewed my daughters facebook/instagram and see her friends that she grew up with going everywhere on Gods green earth on holiday.. I ask, how can they afford this, I know their parents, they can't afford that?? Is it credit cards? Nope, I was told, it's student loan money; what doesn't get used for school ends up back in the students bank account.. so and so actually put a big chunk of his student loan overage on an A4.. Again, anecdotally, but I am sure there are some stats out there about college costs vs. student loan debt that would show this is a larger problem. And don't forget, millennial's biggest debt is credit cards and at the same time, half of that subset are college oriented

I guess where this whole conversation is going is what to do.. there are several cultural things (better guidance by parents, teachers) that need to change, for sure, that would prevent a lot of millennial debt. There are things that the government should do to step in (outlaw predatory practices) and things they shouldn't do.. Largely, the fact that tuition is so high is due to government backed loans (different conversation), it's never good to ask the government for help.

What I see here is there are bad **decisions** by both parents and students on top of predatory practices by student loan and credit card companies. But I will always say this is a personal responsibility. Society cannot be responsible for your decisions, you are.. just as you are responsible for getting yourself out of the situations you put yourself in. When I hear conversations about millennial's having high debt, unable to pay it off, I worry the next part of the conversation is what leftists have already started which is - debt forgiveness. What they really mean is higher taxes or shifting it to our national debt.

"fair enough, although you may want to find more than a single reddit post but im willing to believe this guy"
"Like I said it was not a ratified treaty and there is mounting evidence that forced the US from staying with that so-called ""deal"".
"
I’m not sure what you’re saying.
"I'm not American, not a fan of KSA either. Just someone who is interested in geopolitics. As a westerner, it's a bit sad to see the ideology being pushed out of the picture in favor of financial interests. 

KSA is far from being the hegemon, they heave politics influence and religious clout, but other than that they have very little power. 

Certainly interesting to see such big geopolitical shifts taking place in such a short amount of time. 

Edit: sorry for not responding to most of your points, on mobile. "
"As I noted, this isn't just about the nukes."
Sounds like he realized the deal was made in bad faith since the Mossad report showed us they in fact hadn't destroyed all their progress towards a weapon.
"I think the most frustrating thing for a lot of sub-median income is this assumption that they aren't ""living within their means"". Heck, even for people who make fairly high above the median income. Average millennial makes $35k: take out taxes (15% = ~$5K roughly), rent ($7-10K/year if you're near any big city for a basic room), food ($2k/year), and then health insurance (variable). That leaves you with 10-15K/year, if everything goes perfect, for anything else including: a car/car payments & insurance, any incidentals, any accidents or bad luck, gas, etc. At the end of the day, there's little room to pay off any student loan debt or credit card debt. A lot of people find themselves in similar situations post-grad, and if they don't have Mom or Dad to help them out by living at home or whatever, it's going to take forever to pay off $20-100K+ of debt at a 6% annual interest rate. 

But I don't blame these people. Yes, there is probably a large group of people that just poorly managed their money in college/post-grad and were financially irresponsible. But from what I've seen, it's mostly the kids of parents from the middle class who find themselves in this situation. Rich enough help their kid out in college and encourage them to get a good education because they think it will lead to better things, but not rich enough to fully support their tuition costs. And no school counselor, parent, or teacher ever really told these kids exactly what they would face if they went for that art, literature, science, etc degree. And how could you expect a 16-17 y.o. to know that on their own? It's the system and the older generation that is initially failing these kids and putting them in a tough spot to begin with. How they handle it afterwards it up to them though. 

On top of that, tuition has been rising at criminal rates the last 2 decades, far outpacing inflation and damn near everything else. This only leads to an ever increasing problem. As to what to about student loan debt? There's not really a good answer. I think free/subsidized higher education would be nice, but we would need a socialistic system that worked at a grander, more organized scale. Which will likely never happen in the US. I think loan forgiveness is probably our best bet unless we regulate tuition prices, but instead of handing out loan forgiveness like candy, use it to encourage professionals to work in underprivileged/developing areas. That will further boost the economy of those areas and allow them to grow into larger populations. 

Sorry for the long post, but my two cents. I agree with you that you're responsible for your decisions, however, I hope you can agree with me that expecting high school kids to plan their financial future is slightly absurd. That burden should fall on society (i.e. parents, school systems, colleges themselves, etc.) to make kids aware of the risks and cost/benefit of their choices. Which they don't.

 Also, anecdotally for me: going to UGA, which I would consider similar to UF as a large, state college. Most people swiping their credit cards left and right are almost always using their parents accounts. There are ample amounts of kids from well-to-do families at those big state, college footballs schools. I've known people and acknowledge there are those out there who abuse student loans and spend it like crazy, but I assure you they are the minority. "
there is no mounting evidence and nothing was forced.
"Yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all. Basic concepts seem to be a real struggle for you.

> the reality is that it’s not as simple to keep track of everything

It is. Most businesses have entire departments that are solely dedicated to where their raw materials come from and how political/environmental factors can affect the acquirement of said materials.  "
"So what is the reasons to diabolize Iran...especially at this time where the whole region is on fire?  you talked about ""kinetic"" and ""economical"" approaches..why does the US needs these approaches ?   if you think what they are doing is logical , give me one single relevant argument  if the nukes arent/werent the problem... why do they need to put pressure on iran ? "
you are misinformed about the Mossad report. None of it was about anything that happened after the deal was made.
"I didn't say anything was ""forced""."
And the assumption is that the US has unfettered access to that information?
"The reason? geopolitical clout in the Middle East and possibly beyond. 

The US has interests and allies in the Middle East, and Iran is putting both at risk. "
"Do you admit that Iran didn't destroy its nuclear weapons research? Do you agree that the Iran deal mandates that Iran destroy such material? Even if they were previously known files, do you not see how this is a contradiction? "
"> there is mounting evidence that forced the US from staying with that so-called ""deal"".

so what is that word there?"
The way i see it its the US and its allies putting (as usual) the middle east at risk... 
"i have no idea. What I was saying was that none of the documents that Netenyahu produced were recent. All were dated from long before the deal was in place. So explain to me how that's relevant.

Even Trump said Iran was holding up their end of the deal"
You didn't say much here.'the middle east' isn't an independent entity. 
"Because if we make a deal based on me destroying plans for something and you discover a few years later I didn’t destroy the very plans for the thing you’re trying to prevent me from obtaining, it’s kind of the definition of a deal breaker. "
"The US always have urge to ""punish"" countries based on greedy agendas. Its not iran that messed up iraq, its not Iran that messed up Syria its not iran that messed up Libya,  its not Iran that messed up Yemen. Its just that Saudians and americans and israelis dont like their presence and  destabalize these countries based on cheap ass arguments... The US and its allies has been sparking instabilities in Independent middle eastern countries just to satisfy the will of Terror state like KSA and a racist Israeli Governement. Israel wants its land just for the jews and KSA wants a Sunnite United State Like Region. minorities and Chiite are in its way. So We start warmongering a fear propaganda in order to justify these actions. Saudis have been Bombing the shit out of yemen just like Bachar is Bombing the shit out of ""rebels"" backed by the US... yet No one talks abt that.... Iran protected our borders fron ISIS yet israelis bombed Hezbollah locations... The only credit that orange buffoon has the right to take is planting instabilities which may lead to a global war.... "
"the deal wasn't based on whatever they did in the past. It was based on obligations they would abide by after the deal was signed. All parties involved (and the inspectors) said Iran was abiding by them Even Trump said they were abiding by the letter of the contract. 

To suggest that Iran broke the deal is false. Trump walked away from it because he didn't like the deal."
"Sounds like a big rant more than a rational argument.

There's no 'good' and 'bad' side here, all geopolitical actors act on their interests and against those who undermine them. 

You like Iran and are in favour of its actions, others aren't. "
"I didnt say  like iran... i said the US is destabilizing the region not Iran and accusing iran of it. And people like you will believe this... Maybe you should try and visit the region and not getting your ""arguments"" from fox news..."
"You understand it's all subjective, right?

From US perspective, KSA/Israel 'hegemony' is considered stability.. others prefer to see Iran taking over and implementing its own version of stability. "
"If you read my replies carefully you will see that i wrote that people are ""stuck"" in a proxy war... Peopl doesnt want an Iranian presence nor an American and Co. Presence....  and again iran respected their part of the deal and all of the countries agreed about that but not Trump and its allies... so its not a matter of ""subjectivity"". Subjectivity is irrelevant if you make people from another continent  believe lies just to justify ur agenda... Subjectivity is relevant when you ask people who are litetally conerned with this matter... which means people who are there.... "
">Peopl doesnt want an Iranian presence nor an American

Sadly, it's not like they have a choice with either. 

>iran respected their part of the deal 

Not quite. The reason this 'deal' was made is because Iran wasn't complying with its obligations under the NPT. Note that this was not really a deal but an ultimatum given to Iran to comply \- Iran was forced to give up everything except for face.

The 'deal' in itself has one big hole \- the IAEA cannot inspect military sites.. and I think we both know that weapons aren't made in civilian installations.

>Subjectivity is irrelevant

To you, perhaps. See, I can understand the motivation for Irans actions, I can even understand why they want nuclear weapons. It doesn't mean I agree with them.

In my view, dismissing that there are a variety of viewpoints only works against you. The only way to diffuse situations like this is to understand what the 'other' wants."
"Would the americans accept that their military installations get inspected ? Why should i trust a country that used the Nuke twice ?  The arguemnt ""Subjectivity "" is irrelevant. I didnt say i dont care abt subjectivity. if you read carefully i said the only people who lives there and  have a relevant view of the situation can have a subjective idea . People who watch Fox News and doesnt know where iran or iraq is, should keep it quiet. Unfortunately these people are the ones doing all the warmongering. And my problem is with this."
">Would the americans accept

You're expecting some element of fairness here that simply does not exist.

In geopolitics the only law is the law of the jungle \- survival of the fittest.

>only people who lives there and have a relevant view of the situation can have a subjective idea

No. They may have a unique viewpoint, and while it certainly is subjective that does not mean other viewpoints do not exist. 

> People who watch Fox News and doesnt know where iran or iraq is

Most people on this planet don't know geography if it isn't shoved down their throats. 

>Unfortunately these people are the ones doing all the warmongering

You're confusing the people watching TV with those in power. If I said that all Iranians are building nuclear weapons or taking over Yemen/Lebanon/Syria/Iraq that would be just as ignorant."

"Oh the greed of the sands. Hopefully Iran will gradually grow out of its dependency on exporting oil and natural gas. China will buy Iran wholesale depending on the price, though."
China and India are the countries who matter.  Let's see what happens.
"The charge appears to be business fraud, not violation of US sanctions on Iran, *per se*.

Financial institutions are always quite attentive to the risks of working with other companies, especially if the risks concern legal and regulatory compliance. In this case, the allegation is that certain US financial institutions were lied to by Huawei (and Wanzhou Meng personally) about the nature of Huawei's dealings with Iran.

Contrary to common reporting, it is not a violation of US sanctions to do business in Iran in many areas (including consumer telecommunications), nor is it a violation of US sanctions to do business with another non-US business that does business in Iran in non-sanctioned areas. US sanctions are mostly in the nuclear, weapons, oil, transport and financial industries -- but there is a complex web of different laws, regulations and executive orders which makes the whole thing difficult to sort through at best. The added complexity of making sure that a company's activities strictly fall outside the bounds of the sanctions (and the risk of violating them, even inadvertently), has put off many companies from doing any business with Iran as a blanket rule, as Iran is a small enough market that the benefits do not outweigh the costs and the risks.

Huawei sought funding from US institutions. When those institutions asked about Huawei's businesses in Iran, they were allegedly lied to. Had they known the truth, they may well not have entered into those financial transactions, because ensuring compliance with the sanctions is risky and cumbersome. Thus, Huawei's dealings with those financial institutions were fradulent, according to the allegations.

Though politically, this might seem like the US is just trying to block Huawei's expansion by any means possible, the simple fact is that (if the allegations are true), Huawei chose to do business in Iran, knew that also doing business with American companies at the same time would be a headache, and then tried to cover up its Iranian dealings. This cover-up was the crime -- not the dealings in Iran themselves, which by my reading was perfectly legal for Huawei to do, as long as they stayed away from certain industries and persons."
">	Between 2009 and 2014, Huawei used an unofficial subsidiary, Skycom, to conduct business in Iran, Gibb-Carsley said, telling the court: “This was the crux of the fraud.”

>	In 2013, Meng “personally represented to banks that Skycom and Huawei were separate” the lawyer said, after the banks became aware that Skycom was doing business in Iran.

and

>	“Meng deceived financial institutions and in so doing put their pecuniary and financial interests at risk,” he said.

This is the central focus of the allegations - “violated U.S. sanctions” doesn’t really explain much."

She wanted it hua wei.
They're building a case step-by-step.  First get her on fraud to prove that Skycomm and Huawei are the same entity.  Then use that conviction as solid proof that she/Huawei is responsible for Skycomm's dealings with Iran.
"I know we all hate China,

but US sanction is not Chinese law, chinese citizens and companies have zero obligation to follow US sanction. US does not own China or Chinese citizen nor have any power over them, except by military force.

The CFO didn't even violate Canadian sanctions, so why is Canada the one arresting her on behalf of US?"
"A powerpoint that contained fraudulent misrepresentstions....

Straight up this. This is politically motivated. Canada is fucked for not giving her bail. Kissing the ass of America. Shame on Canada. 
"Well, only if Canadians visit a country who has an extradition treaty with Iran or NK.  Not sure if any countries do, but if so they are likely countries that I wouldn't visit anyways.

If *would* be wary of visiting China anytime soon though.  Especially if I was a top executive at a major US tech/telecom company."
Very confused.  Breaks EU and American sanctions?   It's a Chinese company and she is in Canada.
"She allegedly lied to banks about their business structure to obtain continued financing. That’s fraud, and it’s illegal. "
"We have an extradition treaty with the US.  If they assert that she broke an American or international law, that would be considered comparably illegal under Canadian law, then we're obligated to arrest her.

She is entitled to a legal defense to fight the extradition, in which case the US government will need to provide a preponderance of evidence to convince a Canadian Justice that the extradition is warranted.

Companies that operate globally have to respect the laws of the countries they operate in, including banking laws.  That said, I don't know if the US has a legitimate case or is playing politics, that's for the system to determine.  But they will certainly not arrest her and extradite her just because the US asked.  There is due process protecting her."
">I know we all hate China,

&#x200B;

The Chinese Government. Most don't hate China or it's citizens, but the government is absolutely undesirable."
Its pretty obvious you're chinese. You don't have to pretend to be American by putting yourself in the we. 
"I don't think you know what arrest warrants or treaties are.

>On November 30, a Canadian judge agreed to a US request that Meng be arrested, and on December 1 she was detained at Vancouver’s airport as she changed planes, said Gibb-Carsley.

Be happy she's being charged with fraud instead of espionage."
Well the Chinese should be thankful we don't do more to punish their disgusting theft of our technology 
"When you do business in other countries, you are subject to their laws. Not sure what's confusing about that. Just the same if you went to another country and broke one of their laws. Even if it's not illegal in your native country. 

Also, Canada and the US have an extradition agreement. So if you travel through one country, they can extradite you to the other to face criminal charges, esp. when you aren't a citizen of either country."
">I don't know if the US has a legitimate case or is playing politics, that's for the system to determine.

Possible that it is both.

It seems *highly* unlikely to me that here is not at least some degree of political motivation in Meng's arrest, given the timing. Huawei is a huge and hugely important company in China. Imagine if the CFO of Boeing was arrested in Myanmar for violating Chinese sanctions against weapons  sales to Taiwan - surely it would be obvious that the motives were primarily political. "

"Trump can go and fuck himself. Thanks, the UK. "
"Fuck off you orange twat, love Great Britain."
"""Together, we can help bring about the peace and prosperity in Iran that the whole world wants to see.""

That's a nice way of saying regime change. I'm sure Russia will stand by and let that happen. 

Oh by the way fuck off trump ya cunt."
That's not how any of this works though...
I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!! 
'No.'
I hope the UK retains its dignity and doesn't submit to Trump's bullying and threats.
He's reminding Britain what kind of 'special relationship' they enjoy with the USA.
"Well, I demand Trump shove a broken twig up his anus and dance Hopak."
US asks it’s Allies to support US sanctions while simultaneously imposing tariffs. 
"China, India, Japan, Russia, Pakistan, Japan, and the EU (all of who are either major customers, or have investments in Iran) have said they won't follow US sanctions.

Keep in mind, the only reason why sanctions were severe last time were because the rest of the world imposed them as well. This time? The US is virtually alone here."
"""The Trump administration has certified Iran’s compliance twice before: in April and in July. After hundreds of inspections, the I.A.E.A. has produced eight reports confirming that we are meeting our obligations under the agreement. ""

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/opinion/false-assumptions-about-the-iran-nuclear-deal.html"
"Demands, huh? UK will roll over, as it does."
"Where is the key word “demands”? Looks like diplomacy in action, to me."
"Stop saying ""the U.S."" when you mean the trump 'administration'. Two entirely different things."
"You have to understand Trump's base. When Trump says ""It was a bad deal"" he actually doesn't have to provide evidence that it is a bad deal, they just take it as the Gospel According to Trump. The public education systems in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana have failed the children who are now voting-age adults."
"Because the agreement was unlawful under the US *and* Iranian law.

No ratification from Iran's parliament and nor Congress essentially means it's not worth the paper it's printed on."
We can't even run ourselves let alone other countries.
"As an American, at this point, I agree.
"
"But that's the language of the clickbait headline, not the US itself. If you look up the actual language that Johnson used, you'll find it's not noxious at all:

>""America is turning up the pressure and we want the UK by our side,"" Johnson said.

>""It is time to move on from the flawed 2015 deal. We are asking global Britain to use its considerable diplomatic power and influence and join us as we lead a concerted global effort towards a genuinely comprehensive agreement.

I don't equate ""we want"" and ""we are asking"" with ""we demand."" Please don't fall for this embellishment in the future, you're only giving power to newspapers who assume Redditors read nothing but the headline and then go off to post angry comments. That's an easy way to get manipulated. "
"""It's ~~clobbering~~ freedom time!"""
Ah yes that will put the U.K. at the front of the line when negotiating that trade deal post Brexit. I wonder if the insanity of the us president has been factored in yet. It’s easy to take your attitude on paper a d U.K. will almost certainly have to. However the consequences to the U.K. may be rather greater than they hope sadly.
Not at all possible.
"Except the part where we already told the US we won’t. 

Probably didn’t read the article though did you. "
"Is ""threatens"" better?"
"""The President has been explicit: any businesses which put their own commercial interests in Iran ahead of the global good will risk serious consequences for their trade with the United States,"" Johnson said."
"I do not agree with you, Ambassador Woody Johnson, is an official representative of the US.  
And i do not think that any official appointed by one administration, is suddenly not a representative just because the other side won the elections.  
The Obama administration was, and now trump is representing you as the US in the world.  
All that trump did was opening some eyes as to how trustworthy the US is.
It is really a good thing that all those WMD's in Iraq where found that has saved us all from so much problems, but then again that would not have been the US, just the bush administrations. "
"Just like NK.  Senate did not play, its worthless tweeting. "
"This.  So much this.
"
"To be honest any trade agreement we manage to get out of Trump is going to be massively in his favour anyway.  I don't know what's going to happen, other than a fleeting hope this madness that is brexit won't actually happen.

Aside from that the more pertinent point is that Trump is no more than a school yard bully who tries to force countries into doing what he wants with the threat of further action.  If he gets away with it then it'll embolden him to try more and more shit so we and the EU and the rest of the world need to stand up to him now.

Unfotunately, as it stands the US is no longer an ally or even a friend to the UK and we shouldn't be backing down because Trump doesn't like policies his predecessor implemented."
"ROFL. 

""You want us to jump? Yes, Sir. How high was that again??"""
So naive 
"It’s more of a “plea” to the U.K. to join them. 

One thing about Trump I glad of it’s ended our “special relationship” with the US, no more tagging along in their conflicts."
"That might be an argument if you were weighing up the pros and cons at one level, but the problem is no one can trust America. You could back them over Iran (it's not as if the UK's seriously committed there) but because that decision comes first how confident would you be that America simply isn't lying when it comes to the thank you bit later down the road? America has destroyed any trust that other nations might have had in her, and even changing their administration isn't going to restore that when all they'll do is elect Trump 2.0 in another cycle or two"
"That is quite true, and your point is taken. But to me, that is only true of a legitimate administration, and I simply do not feel this particular one is."
Remember more Americans voted or Clinton than voted for Trump. To borrow a Republican phrase from 2008-2016.... ~~That Black Man Obama~~ Trump is not my President.
Correct.  Executive overreach should be recognized and challenged.
No deal from Trump is worth the paper its printed on.  He is a backstabber and his word is worthless.
"Even if the we cancel brexit last mnute some damge has already been done. Economy has stopped rising at large rates, the pound fell, some banks already have left, others will aswell leave London and go to Paris and Frankfurt. London likely won't remain the financial capital of Europe."
"Amazing, 3 statements and a move to support the EU against US sanctions, yet you just ignore that and think “USA USA WERE NO 1”

No wonder your all getting rinsed by Russia."
Cheers Geoff
"A plea?

>Johnson said on Sunday that Britain should join forces with America to enforce the US president's hard-hitting sanctions. He also delivered an explicit ultimatum to British companies, **telling then to stop doing business with Iran or face ""serious consequences"" for their trade with the US**.

They must ""plea"" pretty hard around wherever you are."
I was replying to r/knotasexpected who was questioning whether a demand was made.
"Seriously, I'd find it really fucked up if the candidate with the most votes lost an election in my country. Maybe you guys might wanna fix that?"
"If my memory serves me right so did Al Gore, but the real problem is in my opinion, when someone strikes a deal with the USA, does that deal has any worth for the next administration? Or is making a deal with the USA just an empty token?"
"I don't disagree.  We are going to be damaged by this, it remains to be seen how badly.  With regards to the whole Trump thing though, being in the EU puts us in a far stronger position.  I dread the day when we are forced to accept chlorinated chicken from the US."
We  won't have long to wait before you will be shown to be wrong.
"> The call amounts to a plea for Britain to break with its European Union partners over Iran and adopt Trump's strategy.

From the article, hence why I wrote “plea”. 

The US can bluster all they want, this is a reaction to being told last week we won’t back out the deal with them. 

"
"That's what happens when the President (and VP) is chosen by 538 people with no obligation to vote for the person the people they represent may want, rather than by the country.

Side note, it's still surprising to me how many Americans don't know how the President is elected, and believe that the popular vote is what matters."
Yes. Or at least when the next angry corrupt man gets elected.
"I feel this graph i found represent s the probability of different outcomes and how good they are.   https://imgur.com/gallery/2qE0QmV
"
Keep telling yourself that champ. 
"This is a necessary, but largely symbolic gesture. Iran has a deal with these countries for denuclearization, and has kept to its terms. The US has broken the deal by reimposing sanctions not only on Iran, but on European countries that have unrelated deals with Iran. If the EU does not step up with pressure on the US, the denuclearization deal is done, and Iran would be free to restart enrichment. 

The outcome is sadly going to be worse than before with Iran being isolated with european countries siding with the US. With an increasingly antagonistic and despotic Saudi emerging, there is little option for Iran than going full and aggressive nuclear."
"Hey, the EU would never accept bullying from other governments, why would it give in to the US?"

How did the US break the deal if the deal allows the sitting president the in a quarterly based to withdraw from the deal?
Nobody is nuking anyone over Iran. The West knows Iranian officials and Assad are just Russia’s puppets. The actual citizens are innocent. That is why the US spends $115k each precision hellfire missile from drones. If we didn’t care anything about the families just trying to live their lives we would have cluster bombed everything a long time ago.
To live up to your agreements or not live up to your agreements. This should be a tough decision. /s
Seems it’s more wanting to stop Trump than help Iran.  He’s alienating half of Europe as it is so I wouldn’t be surprised.  Not like he knows what the fuck he’s doing with the sanctions anyways.  
I don't think the EU has every actually put it's foot down though. They seem to be mostly talk
"The EU on the one hand, fears and detests Russia, then suddenly wants to kiss ass with a Russian ally and protectorate. It's astonishing! "
"The 'review', is for whether Iran has resumed nuclear activity. US intelligence has said they have not."
"I don't know where to start with your lack of knowledge. The US has never engaged with Iran in direct conflict, including ever using any drones or missiles. What the US has done is 1) had the puppet Shah rule Iran for them 2) Massacred millions of Iranians through a proxy war with Iraq, where they provided the arms and chemical weapons for Saddam to use.

It is without any factual or historic basis to say that the US gives one shitty fuck about the Iranian people. "
Christ on a cracker your father should have worn a condom.
"You mean the informal agreement with the Obama Administration that never went through Congress? 

Yeah. Really is a shame that the agreement was made in the least legally binding way possible. Probably should get it in writing next time. "
[deleted]
Sanctions against Iran will just make them more reliant on and beholden to Russia. These sanctions have two major impacts: Empowering Islamist hardliners in Iran and pushing Iran closer to Russia. 
EU is so ready to get those 10 mil migrants from Iran's regime change! Can't WAIT! /s 
You know Iranian troops are currently in Syria. Right?
"> 1) had the puppet Shah rule Iran for them 

They would be better off now if they left him in power

> 2) Massacred millions of Iranians through a proxy war with Iraq, where  they provided the arms and chemical weapons for Saddam to use. 

You make it sound like the US pushed for the Iran Iraq war which is not true and it was Germany that sold chemical weapons to Saddam."
">>I don't know where to start with your lack of knowledge. The US has never engaged with Iran in direct conflict

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Praying_Mantis"
"Oh the irony. Catholics are taught not to use birth control, and the crackers are Jesus. 🤣

Did I say something to offend you?"
"EU members should have gone through the US Congress?

And it's absolutely astounding how the buck never stops with Trump, even with things he himself did there's someone else to blame. "
But hadn’t they lifted the majority of the sanctions when they made the original deal?  And are just now going back into effect because we pulled out of the deal.  It also doesn’t help that we are directly attacking their economy with the intent to damage their well-being.  Imagine if another country was doing that to the US.  The sanctions aren’t and haven’t been doing shit.  
"The US under Trump just removed all reason to make deals with it. This demonstrated that if you make a deal the US may, arbitrarily, go back on it's word."
"Those hardliners have been in power since 1979, due to mistakes I freely admit my country made. They have yet to be out of power in any real sense. The revolutionary guard alone makes it so you swing to the ""right,"" even if elected as a moderate. Secondly, they are allied to Russia, the only difference between what I would call an alliance and what they call it, is I believe a formal treaty should exist, and be published, they do not. 

As for the Russians anyways, we ought to be taking them to far greater task. The Europeans ought to increase their defense forces by at least 10 percent across the board and prepare themselves. Britain in particular, needs an even greater expansion due to critically low numbers, both in the Navy and Army. 

Edit: You can down vote until cows bark! It’s the truth. They are allied, kissing up to either will accomplish nothing and anyone whose against serious rearmament to be able to prevent movements made by them will find out quickly to their very great cost, they were wrong. "
"While that is completely irrelevant to nuclear disarmament, its also misleading. Iran has advisers in Syria, not troops.  "
"you should read a history textbook. No, life was not better under the shah. It was great for his buddies in Tehran. The rest of Iran was undeveloped and just being drained of its oil. The invasion of Iran was backed by the US as it was an opportunity to strike while the country was destabilized by the revolution. I'm not giving an opinion as to whether this was right or wrong. This was the sequence of events."
"Trump ended the agreement, but more care should have been had in the drafting of the agreement if people wanted it kept for more than one administration. "

So that is a no. 👌🏼
"Could you please give me a reference?

Saying the US resuming sanctions on Iran isn’t revenant to Iran supporting Assad. Is like saying Jared shouldn’t have been fired from Subway because sandwiches have nothing to do with being a pedophile."
"> The invasion of Iran was backed by the US as it was an opportunity to  strike while the country was destabilized by the revolution. I'm not  giving an opinion as to whether this was right or wrong. This was the  sequence of events. 

I suggest you read other history books bud. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq\_War#Foreign\_support\_to\_Iraq\_and\_Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War#Foreign_support_to_Iraq_and_Iran) The soviets supplied Iraq at the onset of the war and they didn't have real US relations at the time.

> No, life was not better under the shah. 

Did you get that from the same history book that taught you about the Iran Iraq war? Because it is lying to you."
I still don't understand what that has to do with EU powers living up to an agreement they made. Just because the word of the US is worthless doesn't mean theirs has to be. 
"> Right. Let's not damage the well-being of governments who fund terrorism worldwide. /s

It would be interesting to know how you feel about Trump's more-than-implicit support for the Saudi regime then.
"
All they are doing is reinstating the previous sanctions (to my knowledge) which haven’t stopped their funding of terrorism or developing nuclear program.  So explain what they’ve done previously or how this will be any different.  All that idiot is doing is pushing away our allies even more.  
"Thanks for linking the article that does state:

The US didn't get involved in the fight till late in the war that is why you didn't see heavy loses on the Iranian side till the end tail of the war. So you suggesting the Iran Iraq was some kind of US instigated war is unsound.

>My initial point about the US not having any concern for iranian lives is borne out in your provided reference. 

People die in war bud, that is what happens and it wasn't millions of dead.  The war was a stale mate and that is what the US and the soviets were hoping for, they didn't want to see expansion on either side.  "
Do you really think they can or are you just high or something like that ?
"Fair point, I admire your consistency! Refreshing change nowadays, even if I disagree with Trump's Iran stance (I think he has nefarious motives) and thus your viewpoint on it."
"So say the fool. Yes. They can. The Russian Army now is bigger than the French, German and British Armies combined. So let me ask what the fuck you are high on? Living in cloud cuckoo fantasy land doesn’t make you or your upvoters right, also the Ukraine, Crimea and Syria say you’re wrong. Try again with your disarmament horseshit. "
"Yeah, because in our nuclearized times it's all a matter of who has the biggest army. This is why the USA invaded USSR during the cold war, right ?"
"Meanwhile, lifts Russian sanctions.

Cunt."
"I am in hope of peoples recognizing the oneness, our connectivity, and stop hurting ourselves by hurting others.  It's senseless to do so.  "
"Because if they do, the US will ask for extradition and never act on it, placing the extraditing could try at odd with everyone while Trump just stay there doing nothing."
A peaceful solution to alleviate a nuclear crisis was created between European and American allies. Trump likes that Israel buys American military equipment. Trump learns Israel doesn't like Iran. Trump removes peaceful option from the table. Europe scrambles to unfuck situation. Trump goes golfing and threatens allies.
He's such a moron. Nothing he does surprises me anymore. But everything he does annoys me. 
"Iran would’ve and will never be peaceful. Iran has no interest in developing nuclear power for energy, they can go green or use oil. Thinly resonate they want nuclear power is to enrich uranium to get plutonium. Remember what N.Korea did to the western world forever? That’s Iran’s aim except when they get the device, they’ll use it. Iran is still a state sponsor in terrorism globally, can you imagine these terrorist with a dirty bomb or even worse a nuke? I know ‘orange man bad’, but Iran is not a democracy, it’s ran by ‘supreme leader’ not a democratically elected official."
"Do you have any proof Iran will use their nuclear bomb ? Why on earth ?
They are menacing Israel daily but they don't do anything significant against it except funding Hezbollah. Their closest tie proven tie with terrorism is (very) active support of Hamas which is part of the Muslim Brotherhood. The other stuff has been only promoted by an american judge who wanted a culprit for the 9/11 attacks.

If they wanted a suicide war they could start it right now. They proved they could do it against both Iraq USA. They know that if they attack Israel the USA and Israel will bomb every square centimenter of Iran.
You fail to understand that Iran is not like ISIS. They are a millenia old ""country"" with a rich history, with a very decent education system. It is also a semi-democracy. They have however a very violent authoritarian regime, which condemn to death the most people per capita.

Also Israel developed its bomb with France, South Africa if anything mostly got help from Israel."
"I agree with some of what you're saying and I think I understand the point of view. I think that:

They're going to get nukes either way, and when it happens it would be better if they have less reason to want to nuke people. 

I think it's better to make a case to sanction them on specific human rights violations, appeal to the best interests of the Iranian people, and support democracy where it exists. 

Otherwise it just looks like the US is doing Israel's bidding and establishing a monopoly on nuclear technology which will only further mobilize extremism.

If there's any hope for democracy it must come from the people who want to see change that reflects the best interest of humanity, not because mean orange man cut off the trade supply for their chick pea farms over a deal with a neighboring country that is also committing human rights violations."
"Let me clarify, if (when) iran gets nuclear weapons it will be very bad and might set of a chain reaction i.e Iran bombs Israel, Israel bombs Iran and Saudi Arabia, US and Russia intervene, cold to hot war, India bombs Pakistan while US and Russia are distracted then it snowballs from there. 

The supreme leader of Iran believes in an ideology, not diplomacy. Islam spread from Saudi Arabia through the Middle East via violence and subjugation. Syria Iraq and Turkey use to all be Christian. This is not the first time the ideology of Islam has made a deal with another entity just to comeback later and renege on their promise. Their ideology says Israel shouldn’t exist. 

I’m no fan of Israel btw, but they do have the right to exist.

There are some grass roots efforts to reform Iran but the supreme ruler rules with an iron hand so I wouldn’t hold your breath.

Anti-proliferation is a good thing, a really good thing. S.Africa helped Israel get there nuke(s), not the US, France or Britain. Israel broke treaties getting their nuke. "
Of course we did..  They were going to buy the oil regardless if we put on new sanctions.   This way we can say we allowed it to happen though it had no bearing on it.
It's better to do a PR move when China and India have already announced they'll buy Iranian oil no matter what the US does. What happened to the French and German business in Iran? 
"I'm pretty ignorant to how the economy works, but won't this just cause gas prices to rise in the US and not much else?"

Iran Continues to Comply With Nuclear Deal, U.N. Atomic Agency Says (Aug 2018)

"
President Trump using Iran sanctions to gain votes in midterm Elections.
"Iran is already feeling immense pressure and it's about to get a whole lot worse. There's really no scenario where Iran comes out good here. Their best case scenario is to tuck their tails and their rhetoric away and come grovelling back to the bargaining table. We all know they're too proud to do that, though. 

Here's hoping this is the final nail in that awful government's coffin. "
[deleted]
"Oh, it won't be. It will take a few more generations for them to change. "
">While they will feel the effect of sanctions the EU and asia are not reimplementing theres and already exceptions and extensions

That doesn't matter. US sanctions are global. Companies caught doing business with Iran won't be able to do business within the US or with the US government. Most major corporations have already pulled logistics and infrastructure out of Iran. There may be a few more companies willing to do business there who don't have US ties, but relatively few and not enough to make any real difference. The US knows what it's doing. 

>Pressure will be but smaller than before when they were negotiating with Obama and it will be completely gone in 2 years after 2020 elections.

lol what are you basing this on? Pressure is already high on the regime. Like I said they are dealing with nightly protests and riots in multiple cities and uncontrollable inflation making their money worthless, coupled with 80% unemployment which is also rising. 

>Most countries are not on board with Trumps crazy ideas of pressuring regime change

I don't think you understand the implication for countries and companies caught doing business with Iran under these circumstances. Very, very few are willing to risk doing business with a $20T economy just to do a little business with a rapidly declining economy with a $440B GDP and 80% unemployment. This is pretty basic common sense. "
"I don't know about that. Iran's population skews young and we'll educated. Protstest and riots forced the regime to the bargaining table in 2015. The protests and riots are back, every night occurances in Tehran and other cities. They aren't going to get any better. 

Iran's youth have seen what life can be like without sanctions. Now they're facing 80%  unemployment, small bsmusinesses closing because they cannot import materials and rapid inflation. It's unlikely to take generations. "

"For all the EU's talk they've done the exact opposite. Almost every EU company and country has already stop buying from Iran and has pulled money and infrastructure from Iran. 

China, Japan and SK are expected to receive waivers from the Administration to take longer to draw down, but all have drastically cut Iranian oil purchases already.

"They certainly are. While EU leaders continue to try to talk a big game all their countries have balked at their illegal arrangement to bypass sanctions and virtually every major EU company has pulled out of Iran ahead of sanctions. Meanwhile, a growing number of EU countries are themselves calling for new sanctions. 

That's pretty much the opposite of the little narrative you were pushing (from sensationalist headlines likely) that the EU is nobly standing in opposition to US sanctions. "

">also people like you dont understand that new company popping just to trade with iran will popup if there is profit

It's incredibly ironic that you'd accuse me of not understanding something when this statement reveals you do not even understand how sanctions work in practice. Do you really think that the US government hasn't considered this or that they haven't had to deal with that before? XD

>your own articles claim china and russia will maintain trade and that iran has huge reservers

Ha. ""Huge reserves"". They have about $200B in currency reserves. This might last them a couple years if they have to start selling stuff off. Also, these are estimates based off old data. The rial has completely collapsed in the last six months. It's worth essentially nothing now. Iran is dealing with 80% unemployment right now and nightly protests and riots. 

Sorry about the paywall. Nothing I can do about that. Here's another article: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/30/denmark-says-foiled-iranian-plot-kill-opposition-activist

>The Danish foreign minister, Anders Samuelsen, said the foiled attack was “completely unacceptable” and that his government “will respond to Iran and is speaking with European partners on further measures”.

France has also recently accused Iran of plotting attacks on European soil. In October, French diplomatic sources said that they had concluded that Iran’s ministry of intelligence was behind a foiled bombing attack that targeted a rally organised by an Iranian opposition group near Paris in June.

Another: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/31/foiled-assassination-plot-denmark-may-just-have-cost-iran-partner-against-trump/

>“But this incident makes it harder for the E.U. and the E3 [Britain, France and Germany] to make their case to defend the deal. It puts them into an uncomfortable position: They will have to put out a strong message to Iran whilst at the same time trying to keep the nuclear deal alive,” Vakil said."

">How are they going to punish company that has zero presence in the US and only do bussiness in EU and some middle east?

The US will sanction parent companies and individual countries. I've already posted about how no EU country is willing to be the one to defy the US because they're fearful of sanctions against them. 

>It was hugely different when EU was on board, wasnt it?

Not really. The EU is mostly feckless and cannot provide for it's own security. It's also becoming weaker on the world stage and in six months is set to lose 20% of it's GDP overnight. The EU is largely irrelevant because every EU country would rather do business with a $20T economy than a $450B econo y (that's generous, too).

>Maybe you want to see quick google unemployment stats for iran

This data is ancient. Since Trump announced that US sanctions would resume the Iranian economy has completely tanked. The rial is next to worthless. Thousands of small businesses have been forced to close and there have been massive layoffs in every major economic sector. 

At this point it feels like you're just arguing semantics, though, trying to catch me saying something that you can claim is untrue so you feel like you've ""won"" the debate. I really don't care, though. I'm calling things like I see them. Anyone who thinks the EU is really going to defy US sanctions is kidding themselves. Iran is in a horrible situation economically and it's about to get ten times worse. 

Regardless of what semantics you feel like quibbling about the only thing that matters is what has happened. For all their talk the EU has managed to do jack shit to preserve the agreement and member states are now calling for new sanctions themselves. "

"Congress wouldn't back any action on Syria, either. Wouldn't even hold a vote. Obama was foolish to call it a ""red line"", but I think he learned his lesson then and there: Congress will never do anything to help as long as Rs are in control.

So then the choice is JCPOA or no JCPOA. A fully nuclear armed Islamic Republic, or one we can control through the threat of sanctions. Obama made the right choice. He bought 10 years at *least* of no nukes in Iran, and Trump just shit-canned it."
Then Trump should have asked for congressional support to cancel the treaty to really highlight Obama's missteps. The same for sending troops to the border where Obama took heat for doing that himself.
There was no treaty in the first place! That's why he can cancel it at will.
I think you're missing the point here. Obama clearly didn't need congressional approval either as we saw with our own eyes.
"No, you are. The point is that there should have been a treaty."
"Do you really think that Trump or the Republicans care about that aspect of it? They would've canceled it regardless and you know that. Obviously there was ""something"" to cancel and that ""something"" was a deal with a foreign nation after all. By getting approval to cancel it it would've shown how the process is supposed to work.

Also isn't Trump supposed to get congressional approval to move troops domestically?"

To the substance of the idea that it wasn't a good thing, though, you're just way off-base.

What more did you want, and how does putting sanctions back on help anyone?"

As to Obamas greatest achievement, I wasn't against the Dodd-Frank act, I also thought he did a good job with Cuba, and although I vehemently disagreed with him, he pulled a miracle in getting the affordable care act done.

"
"Except literally every nuclear watchdog said Iran wasn’t building nukes. Also here is the thing about opening trade with people, they become economically dependent on you over time. "
"What support of terrorism? Follow-up question regarding any evidence that you provide to that effect -- if they actually do support terrorism and you think that's worth sanctioning countries over in spite of an arrangement to keep them from becoming nuclearly armed, how egregious do you find it that we aren't sanctioning Saudi Arabia or AT LEAST ceasing the sale of arms to them as they're currently, as violates international law, blockading Yemen and causing the Yemeni people to die of cholera and starvation?
And again, Iran had no nuclear weapons to give up, and they weren't going to have any, because they couldn't make their own, and no one was going to sell them any, regardless of whether or not they tried to buy them.

You know, I forgot about Dodd-Frank, but I don't think he deserves most of the credit for that. Regardless, it's a half-measure at best. And I have NO idea how the ACA was a miracle when the idea came from the Heritage Foundation under Nixon and he could have gotten anything he wanted with his supermajority if he had actually pushed for it, which he didn't."
"Iran said they were only ever developing nuclear power for peaceful purposes, which was a lie.  We know this and Netanyahu used credible intel that it was a lie.

Unfortunately Iran was becoming economically dependent so they can support terrorism and destabilization.  They have only been discouraging economic improvement with said acts, which again is against what they agreed too."
Just go to the Department of State website to see the countries that are listed as supporters of terrorism.
"Netanyhu said they broke the deal with things prior to the agreement and didn’t turn over all of their records. Iran was able to make uranium still, but the amount they were making would take decades in order to have enough for even a little nuke. Iran will become dependent through it being westernized by having large Western companies in it. By having Western companies there they will become more dependent because if they become sanctioned again they will lose tens to hundreds of thousands of jobs and kill their economy. "
"Sure, they say they are, but that's not evidence. The United States has a long record of defaming any other country that we don't like."
"Part of the deal is they wouldn't be involved in provocative actions.  Even former President Obama has stated they have not lived up to that by supporting terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah.  

This stifles any chance of them joining the global economy because it severely hurts business.  "
[There was no evidence of them continuing to sponser terrorism. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/05/09/fact-checking-president-trumps-reasons-for-leaving-the-iran-nuclear-deal/?noredirect=on)
"Goes to a pay site and does give me access, so I can not respond to it.

I can say Obama stated this:  

Instead, Obama claimed, that Iran’s troubles even after the lifting of sanctions under the nuclear deal were due to its continued support of Hezbollah, ballistic missile tests and other aggressive behavior."

"It means the US is in violation of International Law

Iran was caught plotting bombings in France only this week. Seems a bit rich.
"So what? The US claims the right to drone people and blow up schools and wedding parties.  The target of this alleged plot, is a known terrorist group that blew up a bunch of Iran's officials -- the current Supreme Leader is partially paralyzed because of their bombs, Trust me, nobody in Iran really gives a shit if these people are doused in gasoline and set on fire (which they've been known to do to themselves, being a cult.)


Anyway thus far the only info we have are anonymous claims prior to any kind of judicial investigation, which say that the actions were undertaken by a faction to undercut the Iranian president."
">So what? 

There's your answer.

&#x200B;"
"You don't seem to understand that the consequences of violating treaties is signifanctly different: if no one can trust the US to keep promises, that undermines the credibility of the US as an ally, an economic partner, etc. Of course, this has largely already happened so this is a moot point now..."
"That's PR speak. The reality is that treaties get violated, reneged and changed all the time - either by Iran, US, European countries or other geopolitical actors. Sometimes there are consequences, sometimes there are no consequences - it depends on which side of the relationship holds the power.

If you've ever been a business owner you'd know that there are parallels there too.

The partnership(s) you speak of are based on these power imbalances, and would not have existed otherwise.

The UN exists thanks to that power imbalance, NATO exists because of it, FTA's are negotiated within that framework, freedom of navigation is a consequence of it etc etc. These things aren't static.. assuming they are is naive."

its the smart play. the american government much like its people can be quite fickle. that has always been the case but never so pronounced as under the leadership of trump. like it or not the deal brought about a grudging peace to a land whose natural resources are valued worldwide. and with that peace came profit. The U.S. want to control which could come at the cost of war while the E.U. wants order which could come at the cost of the american alliance
If the EU abandons The Iran Deal it could lead to a regime change in a direction nobody wants. North Korea got the better deal because they had nuclear weapons now every small country will rush to develope nukes. Donald Trump has made the possession of nukes a pre-requisite for global standing and recognition.
EU: put him on hold
“Never been so fickle as under trump” you kidding right? We went to war with North Vietnam under the flag of dominos when in all reality we pushed them into communism by not originally assisting in their push for separation from France like they asked us. Then our government lost their minds as communism became the only play they had for support and we dropped more ordinance on them than any other war we’ve ever been in. I would say on a scale of 1 to fickle things were pretty damn fickle under Kennedy and LBJ. 
">Donald Trump has made the possession of nukes a pre-requisite for global standing and recognition

That is what the UNSC P5 is all about; the idea that nuclear states have more say than others precedes Trump by several decades."
We're fucking shit up now for no good reason. At least communism was real.
Nothing but more American Imperialism. 
"“We urge all nations to take such steps to make clear that the Iranian regime faces a choice: either change its threatening, destabilising behaviour and reintegrate with the global economy, or continue down a path of economic isolation.""

I find it interesting how sometimes in statements like this and especially when looking at the current US government, they can often make as much or even more sense when mirrored back on those that are making the statement.  Swap Iranian for US and it’s not an unrealistic sentence. "
About time
Yup.

"Iran will be a even harder war to finish than Afghanistan, Iraq, etc.... they are better armed better trained and are fanatics.

USA are again trying to force its will on soveriegn nations, lets not forget USA caused the Islamic republic by forcing another 1 sided govt on the persian people..


"
"I dont want war with Iran, just like how I don't want war with Russia or North Korea. I think all these countries deserve the harshest sanctions possible. The nuclear deal seemingly gave Iran a free pass to do whatever they like in the region, as long as they didn't build nukes. Their funding/arming of Hezbollah and their actions in Syria are perhaps more concering than any nuclear program."
I know. I'm so against this bullshit. It's so stupid and shortsighted. It will backfire as our meddling in the Middle East always fucking does...
"That's fucking retarded. How can you say Hezbollah is worse than a nuclear armed Iran? One nuclear bomb could kill millions, instantly. If they built an aresenal, the US could be severely threatened and possibly even blackmailed. We had actually solved it by *diplomacy*, too. That was an amazing feat.

The deal was a success and Trump is a spiteful idiot. He jeapordizes OUR OWN security by ripping up the deal - he's directly repsonsible for that - Iran was abiding by the deal framework.

Europe is saving the deal by making it illegal for EU companies to cave to US sanctions, thank god they actually have intelligent, rational leaders. We used to.

Like are we going to sanction the EU and our major allies? Really? That's beyond shortsighted. It's lunacy.

If you're worried about the Russians, you should be concerned at shitting on all our alliances more than anything.

Putin is just sitting there laughing at how we are about to force ourselves out as the major global leader."
"Theres a reason why the invasion to iran was called off.from costing 15 trillion dollars estimated to needing about half our armed forces to invade and enforce the region.dont get me wrong I dont mind if the united meddles in the middle east,as long as the host nation asks and is in good standing,and without direct contact with our forces.and if it does do that it must keep its commitment,as in just dknt jump ship when problems occur,as this causes not only short term but long term as well."
So would you support lifting the Russia sanctions if Putin threatened to tear up START if we didn't? Just wondering. 
I Agree with you again.
*dont jump.sorry bad typing
"No, because there is nothing regarding sanctions in the agreement. Sanctions are an unrelated issue.

We are violating the JCPOA *we negotiated* by reimposing sanctions, because lifting of economic sanctions is expressly stipulated within.

Also, that's a very poor to borderline idiotic comparison as they already have nuclear weapons, and we have already been through the arms race and as I said current sanctions are unrelated nor part of the agreement.

Now if Iran had thrown out/violated the deal, then it would make sense to reimpose sanctions, but they were in compliance, so we are the ones violating it."
All good. Where are you from? You seem to understand the sentiment in the Middle East.
"It's idiotic to allow Iran to do anything they want in the middle east, free of consquences, just as long as they don't pursue a nuclear program...That seems pretty dumb to me. If Iran starts a nuclear program, then they'll have to deal with 24/7 military strikes on their facilities...Their choice"
"Im from the united states.i read on news that happens in the middle east.dont get me wrong I do support our military and our allies abroad,its just that when i read the news and intelligence briefings that the u.s and nato release.iran has never acted hostile to any allied country.i didn't support the proposed bombing/invasion and I dont support it now. Diplomacy is more powerful than any weapon."
And thank you for the compliment.
"This is the type of thinking that got us into Iraq, created a power vaccuum and allowed the rise of extremist groups (i.e. ISIS). Stop supporting fighting wars in the Middle East. It makes things worse every single time. Haven't you learned from the past...?

It's clear you have no problem invading Iran. I'm not going to fight that war. I'm outside the draft age (18-25) and I won't support it. You can go die in the Middle East if you really want to - have a blast."
"What iran is doing in the middle east has permission of the host country.so how can we have a problem.unless iran attacked the u.s I dont see the point.the u.s needs to act like what our past generations did,be diplomatic and find a middle ground,instead of going to war,as wars create enemies and screws over any local allies that support the u.s.as we seen happening in syria and iraq."
"I agree with you. Although I'm not sure Assad's wishes are truly that of the Syrian people, he is committing atrocities on them and using banned chemical weapons, but otherwise yes, you're right."
"I do agree with what you said about assad,I am concerned about assad,i just hope putin could have some dialogue with assad.the syrian people deserve peace.they been through enough."
Sounds like someone needs some freedom.

What will be happen after killing the JCPOA ( Nuclear Deal )?

"  Trump is narrowing down his wars. He knows people rally behind a president during war.  He has some programs to help the wealthy that need the people to be distracted. Iran will be much tougher than Iraq, but generating a nobility class in America is worth it to Trump. Every Trump program includes huge tax breaks for the billionaires."
"Good. The only way to stop the biggest terrorist organization in the world, aka the USA, to fuck with you is to get nukes. ""But what if they use them on the USA or Isreal?"" That's called ""win-win""."
"These new USA politics are so inexperienced that it's impossible to expect any reasonable action. I see the day that Americans beg Iran for a new deal.
From Tehran with love."
Very interesting. Anybody who knows more? What exactly was breached? How do dems feel about being tricked into this?
"Since Iran is the expert on what laws are going to pass in the US.  Notice anything passing the Senate lately?

Why do people post this crap?"

Lol we believing shit from an Iranian News Agency now?
">  don't see why North Korea would even bother to negotiate with the U.S if they can just kill of a deal for no reason

Why restrict the observation to North Korea?

"
"Why? They must have some reason, half baked or not, to slap sanctions?"
 some counties have had enough of this BS and simply started developing nuclear weapons for self defense-
Iran should have known better.  Make a deal with one party like the Democrats and Republicans will revoke it and change the deal.  The only way to really protect that deal would be to establish a fee if they remove the deal.  Deals with the US would always be that kind of bipolar attitude.  
"eh just wait for another 3 years. 
orange chimpanzee will declare a war on iran just before elections because um terrorism.

Americans will lap it up."
US is simply cancer to the modern world
"Can Iran ever do what it's fucking told and stop jeopardizing peace?

Fucking idiots. "
With Iran you can't because their last democratic leader was removed by a coup led by CIA because he didn't want to give free oil to UK 
"Not sure how to answer that.  Iran is controlled by the Ayatollah. 

Russia is a kleptocracy/oligarchy controlled by what is basically Putin's mob and the masses kept in line with the Orthodox church.  

Saudi Arabai is all about the money and the military bases.  

China is our economy.  

I don't think any of them are culturally similar to the US.  "
"Because russia is the enemy of every nation on earth, so is SA. Most of the worlds problems can be attribuited to these two."
"I think a war with Iran would break Trump. I think they have the ability to inflict heavy causalities and as the war with the US would be no longer something to avoid they would probably mine the whole Strait of Hormuz, angering the US allies who then have problems exporting their own oil until the mines are cleared which could take some time"
No Israel or Iran... Hm.. throw in the US and Russia and we'd have a pretty good deal.
"A bit much, wouldn't you say? We should never be cheering on a world war and we should not even be considering it when nonviolent options to isolate the US haven't even been tried. If the EU treated the US just like other troublesome allies, that would go further than brainlessly embracing world war."
Do you do anything other than post butthurt rants against the US all day?
[deleted]
All countries have lobbyists lobbying Congress don't they?
The fuck did I just read? 
why would anyone believe the US after they lied so blatantly so they could invade Iraq... that's just one of many examples.
"Of course there are reasons just not the one stated, it only has to do with the Saudis and Israelis."
"Trump doesn't have that power, and congress won't give it to him."

Yeah.  Just send them cash.  Duh.

And then being part of the coalition supporting Iraq trying to conquer parts of Iran (and killing people with poison gas) and shooting down a passenger plane.
You can the deal was a step towards that but sadly we are too close to Saudi Arabia to let that happen.

"I'm pretty skeptical of the US, but that comment made me physically ill. Violence, including war, should be the last resort when all other means of dealing with a situation have failed, and I see no evidence that the world has even made an attempt to punish or divest from the US. A nuclear war that will kill millions, including children and opposition members, is never a win-win situation."
is.. is he wrong?
That's completely unrelated to this topic.  
"To be fair it's an American tradition to fight undeclared wars, the actual scope of Article II be damned."
"No they aren't. Testing other weapons is not protected as part of the deal. Iran is just being a little bitch about it because their arrogant hubris got them slapped, again."
Absolutely  Iran is one of the better ME countries
"Sadly yes
"
"Well, Russia is totally getting what it deserves with its intrusion into Ukraine...

I guess theres an argument to be made that Ukraines government was usurped a few years ago when they threw the pro-Russian guys out, but doesn't justify their ""rebel"" invasion now.  

And I agree with Iran, it seems like we antagonize them for no reason.  They always talk about them sponsoring terrorists, but not even sure who those are. Saudi Arabia does plenty of that."
"Because to them they will do anything to stay in power, nothing is too much. The only way to stop them is to wipe them both out into a pile of smoldering ash. Its in their nature to doing things like fund terrorism and invade countries. The only way that is gonna stop if there is nobody left to organize these attacks on the world."
"He may be partly right, in that the US is proving to be an untrustworthy negotiating partner and unfortunately for some regimes that means developing a nuclear deterrent may be optimal.

But he kind of ruins that bit of correctness by going off the deep end and cheering for the US to be nuked. That's just pants-on-head bonkers. Nuclear deterrence works by *preventing* that kind of thing from happening."
"Is he wrong that the US or Israel getting nuked is a ""win-win""? Absolutely. The fact that he thinks that's okay while criticizing the US foreign policy is hilarious."
"Every President in 50 years has bypassed congress to engage in limited military action. A full-scale war is a different matter. Congress could reverse any action taken without their approval, or remove Trump."

There hasn't been a declared war in that span. Does Congress being willing to fund a war mean it abdicates its responsibility to initiate?
">  limited military action. A full-scale war 

oh so now we are just talking semantics. The ""limited military action in Iraq has been going on for 16 years."
Can you read? Read the fucking headline again then get back to me.
"the saudis have been good allies. they broke opec' in 77. broke the ussr and iran at william casey's behest in 86'. open up the floogates on iran and russia again after russia invaded the ukraine. they've been our allies for 72 years. that's why they are our allies. they do things for us. the others actively undermine us everywhere in the world. 

I'd like to think that russia and the u.s. don't have any inherent conflict points that would preclude an alliance of some sort, but they seem to have decided on china and iran, who both have irreconcilable ideological differences with us."
"Id love to be wrong too. But they have an inflexible nature, Even china is starting to slowly change but russia and SA have refused to change even when given the chance."
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Resolution
"
[deleted]
Yeah but wasn't it Saudi's who did 9/11? We hook up SA and they hook up terrorists who then kill our soldiers. Hell we just made a weapons deal with SA and qatar (enemies) who both support terrorists. They've been good allies if you like wars based on lies.
"And the link on your wikipedia page ""military action in iraq"" leads to another wikipedia article titled ""Iraq war"""
So what you're saying is you are uninformed as to to why the US sanctions (that were nearly unanimously voted for) were put in place? And you have the audacity to even comment here? You have just as much arrogance and hubris as Iran. 
"It was Saudis that did 9/11, yes, but it was Americans that did Oklahoma, Columbine and Aurora. Just because a specific nation's people are involved in a crime, doesn't mean that the whole country is. Hell, we can understand that our countries have waged entire wars in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and more and then turn around and expect people in those parts of the world to like us, but if a few citizens of a country do a terrible thing then we have to lay waste to that entire country?"
It's the act of congress that authorised the Iraq war.
[deleted]
I honestly don't think we should have invaded anyone. It does blow my mind though that SA gets a total pass on this.
"soooo, same shit, different name?"
I thought he might have been Ken M for a second 
"Seems I've landed in a mine field of staunch, uninformed, bone headed ""for the sake of it"" anti American thinking. The only violation of the ""spirit"" of the deal was Iran developing weapons the US considers a threat. That's it. If it wants to play chicken with the US, it will get sanctions. 

This was a near unanimous decision. It isn't partisan. It isn't ""the cheeto bandito flexing his small fingers"" or whatever totally uninformed sound byte you want to condense this into.  This was an all round near unanimous decision by the US. It's pretty clear, if Iran wants to fuck around with the US, they get sanctions. Maybe, just maybe they should focus on other programs and avoid being penalized. Your resentment of US hegemony doesn't change that. "
Saudi Arabia didn't do 9/11. Do you understand the difference between a country doing something and members of a country doing something?
"Somebody above was saying that congress didn't authorise the Iraq War, which is incorrect."
[deleted]
"SA likes terrorists. The people who did it were from SA, so we invaded...Afghanistan to get their Saudi ringleader who was in Pakistan.

I see the distinction but right now Qatar and SA are in a big fight over who funds more terrorists and we just decided to sell them both arms. I call that a pass."
"huh, i only got into this because of semantics."
"Dead wrong. You are oversimplifying the issue and saying the sanctions have ""no basis in reality"" while offering not a single shred of evidence to back up your blatantly anti American propaganda. You insult the intelligence of everyone reading this. Just stop talking like you're an authority on this subject. You're embarrassing yourself. You understand nothing about it. "
"Yes and we do the same thing, but we call our guys ""rebels"" and/or ""freedom fighters""."
[deleted]
"Good point, we should invade ourselves first."
"You made sweeping generalizations with no basis. You said the US ""always voted against Iran"", yet it was the US that spearheaded the deal in the first place. Comment debunked. Then, you make a claim their concerns have ""no basis in reality"". Well, clearly that's dead wrong. The creators of the deal clearly see a bi partisan danger that's present in reality. The response from some signatories is not evidence in itself. If you stand wholly against bi partisan American interests you are clearly anti American. Your bias has been exposed and you can sit down now. 

Being wrong isn't being the victim of an ad hominem attack. Pointing out that you have no clue what you're talking about is just a fact. Sorry if your feelings got hurt but that isn't my problem. "
We did that already.
[deleted]
"I'd say better point but I'm still not sure who ""we"" are."
"Lies? More bullshit from you with ZERO sources. The deal was Obama's initiative. He almost single handedly made it happen. Period. Full stop. Quit talking out of your ass. 

Edit: this is an anti American propaganda cesspool. I'm not in the slightest perturbed by blind biases based on zero evidence. Do your research."
"Pretty much all of the countries in NATO, I think.

Look, I personally think we should be funding the moderates and tipping the scale in favour of having people on that side of the world that aren't psychotic and are sympathetic to our goals, but it's hard to be consistent with that while thoroughly condemning what SA and Iran are doing. We don't like the guys they choose to fund, but we are also helping stir up shot in their backyard.

That said, it's important to keep in mind that SA and Iran are pretty evil regimes for completely separate reasons."
"Maybe the US should fuck off and let people have democracy. Every time some people who elect a leader who cares about them vs. global financial interests we make sure that guy is dead. Sure there's bad guys out there but toppling functioning governments and bombing civilians is exactly how you make ""bad guys"". We blew up your family and are occupying your front yard but if you're over 15 and have a penis you're a terrorist. Why wouldn't you shoot at us?"
"Yeah, I think it's a bit more complicated than that though. Doing something and doing nothing will end badly sometimes and it's not clear when to do what.

The way I see it is, Iran is what happens when we back the wrong person. Iraq is what happens when we do too much, Libya is what happens when we do just a little and Syria is what happens when we try to do nothing at all."
"I like your take but the truth is we are always doing something. There is no ""civil war"" in Syria, there's rebel groups funded by foreign actors.

While you are right it's a ridiculously complicated issue but at the end of the day the US has zero fears militarily so most of this war on terror is just governments fucking with each other to protect or improve the trade interests of a handful of global elites."

"Iran doesn't have any nuclear weapons, they haven't had a nuclear weapons program since ***at least 2003***, and the Obama nuclear deal helped to ensure that they ***couldn't*** get nuclear weapons.

Trump's deliberate breaking of that deal (based on his lies and propaganda) is most likely to push them towards building nuclear weapons because they are directly threatened (on a regular basis) by the US war machine and nuclear weapons might provide them with a defense against US aggression.

Most of the rest of the world recognize that reality, and are trying to help Iran to keep to the terms of the deal (even if the US has illegally broken it), and are helping them to ignore most of the effects of US economic attacks."

"India also had to cut over 60% of oil import from Iran due to US sections.

I was angry at first but than i realized that india decided to accept this in just one say is because Iran backstabbed us as well.

Before even Iran deal was signed Iran declined the contract signed earlier with India to sell their oil field and gave it to another company.

They also Hiked the price and cancelled previous contract in which we used to buy oil from Iran with Indian rupees.

When we asked why they told us ""its just a good business ;)"". We dont take this kind of betrayal lightly.

Maybe Iran will learn how to treat their trusted partners from now on. 

China, India, Japan and South Korea are 4 largest buyers of Iran oil. Let's see how They will react to Trump's sanctions.

----

Personally I believe we don't have any problem with sanctions as long as we can buy oil and other materials from USA and sell our goods to us with reasonable price.

It's a win win for us. India have invited Trump to be our Guest in Republic day parade, let's see what Modi and Trump decides in future."

"Why would it have to be US government property?

The US isnt sanctioning EU government property. Its sanctioning and fining EU private companies. Its the US that is escalating by threatening to take money from EU companies. The EU retaliating by doing the same wouldnt constitute an escalation, but a tit for tat."
"Its Trump, so the US is definitely escalating the situation. But I was responding to the post that said you could confiscate property of those involved from the US in the EU to help offset the financial losses. As it would be the US government/Fed issuing these penalties, thats where the money would have to come from. EU retaliation is a tit for tat, but my statement was meant to imply that the EU has more...logical leaders than Trump and wouldn't drag the world into an every worsening spiral like he is."

">In a background call to reporters, senior administration officials said the goal was twofold: to prod Iran to renegotiate the nuclear agreement so it also addresses Iran’s ballistic missile tests and adventuresome activities in the region, and also to change the government’s behavior.

Except for that fact that it shows the Iranians that you can't trust the United States. I can already hear the Anti-US people in Iran saying ""I told you the American's can't be trusted."" 

>There was no immediate reaction from Iran, but some Iranian officials have said the U.S. breach of its commitments under the deal frees them to resume their nuclear program.

Which is likely what people like Bolton want. It's easier to sell the American public that a country in the Middle-East needs to be invaded if they're building weapons of mass destruction.

"You're leaving out the fact that international inspectors have concluded that Iran is complying with the accord, unlike North Korea who kicked out the IAEA inspectors.

And the Trump Administration is doing to the JCPOA everything the Bush Administration did to the Agreed Framework, except this time without any evidence.

And it's not surprise that the person who wanted to destroy the North Korea agreement was John Bolton.

>Rather than confront the North Koreans and demand they halt their efforts to create a uranium enrichment capability, the intelligence findings gave those in the Bush administration who opposed the Agreed Framework a reason to abandon it. John Bolton, then- undersecretary of state for arms control and international security under President Bush, later wrote that “this was the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework.”

And we all know how well John Bolton's plan worked out.

"Quit your lying. How is the IEAE averaging over two snap inspections a month and ""give a month's notice""? 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-11/iran-nuclear-inspections-double-under-deal-questioned-by-trump

Sometimes they only get two hour notice:

>State provision of information on, and IAEA short-notice access to, all buildings on a nuclear site. (The Protocol provides for IAEA inspectors to have ""complementary"" access to assure the absence of undeclared nuclear material or to resolve questions or inconsistencies in the information a State has provided about its nuclear activities. Advance notice in most cases is at least 24 hours. The advance notice is shorter - at least two hours - for access to any place on a site that is sought in conjunction with design information verification or ad hoc or routine inspections at that site. 

https://www.iaea.org/publications/factsheets/iaea-safeguards-overview

"This is an article from 2015, predicting how the inspections were going to be done. Except, we know how they're being conducted now and they're not 24-day notices."
[deleted]
"Oh, so now we're moving the goal post from ""give a month's notice"" to ""weak points of the deal"".

Even so, you didn't even read your own article! The point of the article is that they NOW have access to military sites, something IAEA never had. And if the Trump Administration revokes the agreement, it'll be worse.

>""The IAEA has never had better access to Iran's military sites,"" says Vaez. ""If the Trump administration loses this unprecedented access ... it will soon wish for it.""

>Vaez adds that derailing the JCPOA now could also have unintended consequences.

>""If the Trump administration kills the deal with Iran, [a deal] that is working and [that] the rest of the international community is highly satisfied with,"" he says, ""it should forget about peacefully settling the nuclear standoff with North Korea.""

That's the debate the article is talking about. Removing the deal would mean IAEA goes back to being dark about what goes on in Iran.

On the point of the 24-days, that would be for military sites that the IAEA would have concerns about:

>He also has said that inspectors need a reason to request access to undeclared sites, and the JCPOA section on access states that ""if the IAEA has concerns [emphasis added] regarding undeclared nuclear materials or activities,"" then it can request to see undeclared — i.e., military — sites. It's unclear what kind of reason or evidence the IAEA would consider sufficient.

If you want to say the agreement needs work, fine. The IAEA heads say that too:

>“There’s room to provide us with more proactive and timely cooperation,” Yukiya Amano, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s director general, said Monday in Vienna.

But he also says there's no ""concern"" (keyword here), and there always room for improvement:

>“I am not saying we have any concerns. The agency has conducted complementary accesses to all the sites and locations in Iran which we needed to visit.”

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-04/iran-can-do-more-after-record-nuclear-inspections-iaea-says

According to the IAEA, there's nothing to show that Iran has faulted on the deal, or that the 24 day notices (if they even used them) are concerning.

Throwing away the agreement would done without any basis in fact and in entirely in bad faith from the US part.

I want an organization that supports both Israelis and Palestinians with their right to self determination, unlike now where if you support one you have to demonize the other. "
"> but that doesn't mean even 10% of it's employees are Arab

Why not build it in Tel Aviv or a place where it is 97% Jews if they don't plan on hiring Israeli Arabs? Why put R&D facilities in places where it would be inconvenient for their employees to drive to work if they weren't Arab? 

>The employees of the old factory are unable to access the new factory because it's built in Israel

Who's fault is that? Also, if Palestinians want a future state they shouldn't expect to be allowed to enter another country without proper documents and approval. If their leaders hadn't organized a 5 year wave of suicide bombings maybe gaining clearance to work in Israel wouldn't be as tedious? 

> It's not surprising you blamed BDS for soda stream losing Arab employment.

They are now employing Israeli Arabs living in the Negev. 

>There's literally a ministry dedicated to trying to stop BDS

They didn't create a new ministry. They are currently creating a list so they can deny prominent BDS supporters who call for the destruction of Israel entry to the country. I am pretty sure if their was an organization dedicated to the destruction of France, France would deny entrance to those people. 

> now Israel is targeting its own citizens if they choose to support non violent political discourse.

Citizens can always enter the country regardless of support for BDS. The literal founder of BDS studies at Tel Aviv University and already has a Master's degree from the place.

"Your username is incredibly appropriate. Intel builds where it wants and it's employees will go. No surprise you couldn't provide literally anything to support your Arab employment claim.


Good job ignoring the fact that Nazareth was supposed to be a Jewish city if orders where followed. If the Israeli government maintains it's military occupation than there will never be an end to violence. If Soda stream chooses to employ Israelis. Good for them. That doesn't change the fact that the Israeli government is what made the past Arab employees unable to continue working.

>Destruction of Israel

Uhh there are plenty of Jews in sects that the believe the existence of an Israeli state must be dismantled in order for the Messiah to return. They literally live in Israel as citizens. Same as Barghoti, neither has done anything violent. They will not be targets of this list. I wonder why?

>Same as Barghoti, neither has done anything violent. They will not be targets of this list. I wonder why?

He is a naturalized Israeli citizen, he has the right to live and work and enter the country. Non-Citizens trying to enter any country do not have a right to do so. France for example can deny entry to anyone just because, no one has the right to enter France unless they are citizens. 


[And here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhfJYkNTcq8).

3. yes, do you think they have pork inspectors going around making sure you're not carrying any pork? you go to a shop buy your sausage and go home. it's not alcohol, it's a sausage

4. learn when to give up and admit you're wrong. if you dont believe me ask on an iranian subreddit or maybe talk to an actual iranian or something something and stop being obtuse"
"Admit I'm wrong? All I'm doing is asking you questions and clarifying. It's kind of funny how defensive you're being and concerned about being right.

"> if they are continuing to develop nuclear capabilities and doing other such fuckery

and since they aren't doing any of that, other than in right-wing US & Israeli propaganda, then maybe the sanctions are fine and working, indeed they should probably be reduced.

Iran has been keeping to the rules, the IAEA has confirmed (very recently) that they are meeting all inspections and complying with all restrictions, so maybe you shouldn't believe so much warmongering, lies and propaganda from those who want to start another war in the Middle east and force some more ""regime change"""
"If you learn about Iran you will find out they spend far less on the military budget then the US ally, terrorism sponsoring: Saudi gang. Furthermore, it is against the religion of Iranian people, Shia Islam, to produce or use weapons of mass destruction. Also they truly believe that nuclear weapons will not bring safety. OH and since the JCPOA the IAEA has said at least 10 times Iran is not doing anything wrong with their nuclear program. So now, maybe you will look at your own country, and allies, who are full with this stuff and UK/US who are providing weapons to destroy Yemen?"
"uhhhhhh I wasn't aware I made any claims, I used this thing called a qualifier (if), because the only thing I am quite certain of is that I do not have these answers... I applaud your certainty though?"
"What Israeli propaganda?

All of the Israeli security branches have been saying Iran is complying to the terms of the deal, the problem Israel has is they are still developing ballistic missiles for their future nukes when the deal ends (abruptly or otherwise) and building bases and missile factories in Syria and Lebanon and continuing to arm Hezbolla to keep harassing Israel, they are just going to push Israel into an other adventure up north that would be devastating to every1 involved"
"Could very well be true, hence the if qualifier... I suspect very few individuals know with true certainty the reality of the situation... I myself am quite certain I am not one of those people, so I try not to hold any beliefs, just opinions that seem to ebb and flow in degrees of truth... And there ain't much more American than regime change in an oil producing nation lol"
developing non-nuclear missiles is 100% acceptable within the terms of the nuclear deal.
Israel has no right to portray Iran as a violent or international law breaking country. Israel has many weapons of mass destruction and is the only country in the world that doesn't have inspections and stuff in this regard.
Pretty sure I have not said otherwise
"Didn't say you did, merely that Israel are complaining about something that doesn't conflict with the agreement.

But then, Israel always complains about anyone that has the potential to oppose their regional domination, except, apparently, for Saudi Arabia, who is being ***much*** more aggressive about trying to rule the complete region (whether militarily or by importing, funding and supporting terrorist groups) while trying to eliminate all Shi'ite influence across the region (Iran, Yemen, Qatar etc) and leaving it dominated by their own extremist Sunni sect instead."
"Gop promises to ""drill baby drill""

Every time they get elected process go up... go figure? Lol"
"Buy shares of EV manufacturers; BYD, BAIC, Tata, LG, Hyundai/Kia, Nissan..."
"Even though the sanctions probably shit on everything, it seems like oil companies pretty much wait for any kind of “thing” to happen and then blame it for rising oil prices. 

Next the metal tariffs will cause the barrels they put the oil in to be more expensive and they’ll have to up the price. "
"Iran has met all of its obligations in the peace deal yet the idiots in both parties in this country continue to demonize them.  At the same time, we sell arms to and schmooze with the actual perpetrators of 9-11 - the Saudis.  It makes no sense."
"Surprise surprise, Bernie was one of the two nays."
What a sorry state the US government is in when only 2 senators actually understand what's going on with the world.
TIL we have 2 sane Senators and a pack of idiots. Who knew ? We'd be better off working with the Iranians and sanctioning the Saudi's.
"What do they think they are going to achieve with this? Every single one of these sanctions is a major blow to the moderates in Iran. 

We were forced to curb our nuclear program. Now it's making our own missiles(which [no one is going to sell us anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReaHBggqiiM)). And weeks after an election with a massive turnout the US secretary of state is [calling for regime change](https://thinkprogress.org/tillerson-calls-for-regime-change-in-iran-ad2ded82f945) in Iran.

At the same time the US is selling 100$ billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, which in the worst case scenario is as evil as we are.

What is really shocking is the number. At a time when there is so much disagreement in US internal politics, when it comes to foreign policy Democrats are suddenly in total agreement with Republicans. I don't think you could achieve agreement against the US in such scale among Iranian politicians."
"Idiots, all of them, you don't want Iran to get nukes, but this is how you get Iran develop nukes. Almost every country in the world with a somewhat capable military develops and tests ballistic missiles, you can't possibly expect them not to, this is no longer about nukes... nukes are an excuse, the US simply hates everything about Iran, ever since their pro-west dictator the Shah was removed from power."
This is important to me because I don't like it when people suffer. And I especially don't like it when people do everything right and yet another group forces punishment on them for no fucking reason.  That's meaningful for me because I've been the victim of learned helplessness (which is the same thing- punishment imposed for no reason) and so this is a topic close to my heart.

">--snip-- the much discussed “28 pages” on Saudi involvement in the terrorist assault, which had been held back as too sensitive to publish, have been released. As it turns out, there are 29 pages, not 28, numbered 415 through 443 in the congressional inquiry into the 9/11 attacks. And deletions on the pages — sometimes words, often whole lines — add up to the equivalent of a total of three pages. So we still are not being given the full story.

>It is instantly apparent that the widely held belief for why the pages were not initially released — to prevent embarrassing the Saudi royal family — is true.

>The [pages](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/18/what-we-know-about-saudi-arabias-role-in-911/) are devastating:

>Page 415: “While in the United States, some of the September 11 hijackers were in contact with, and received support and assistance from, individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government.… [A]t least two of those individuals were alleged by some to be Saudi intelligence officers.”

>Page 417: One of the individuals identified in the pages as a financial supporter of two of the 9/11 hijackers, Osama Bassnan, later received a “significant amount of cash” from “a member of the Saudi Royal Family” during a 2002 trip to Houston.

>Page 418: “Another Saudi national with close ties to the Saudi Royal Family, [deleted], is the subject of FBI counterterrorism investigations.”

>Pages 418 and 419: Detained al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaida had in his phone book the unlisted number for the security company that managed the Colorado residence of the then-Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin Sultan.

>Page 421: “a [deleted], dated July 2, 2002, [indicates] ‘incontrovertible evidence that there is support for these terrorists inside the Saudi Government.’”

>Page 426: Bassnan’s wife was receiving money “from Princess Haifa Bint Sultan,” the wife of the Saudi ambassador. (Her correct name is actually Princess Haifa bint Faisal.)

>Page 436: The general counsel of the U.S. Treasury Department, David Aufhauser, testified that “offices [of the Saudi charity al-Haramain] have significant contacts with extremists, Islamic extremists.” CIA officials also testified “that they were making progress on their investigations of al-Haramain.… [T]he head of the central office is complicit in supporting terrorism, and it also raised questions about [then-Saudi Interior Minister] Prince Nayef.

"Sanders gave a statement that got posted on his Twitter account. He thought the Russian part was good, the Iranian part misjudged and unwarranted."
"> The worst part is, most of them probably know Iran poses no threat

keep telling to yourself if it helps you sleep at night."
Ah but the Dems didn't want another old white guy. They played the gender card and lost.
"Maybe. Though they have been doing this since the nuclear deal. Last time it was 99-1. (Yes the 1 was Bernie Sanders)

It seems this time it's more serious and a lot of people in Iran are saying it's completely against the nuclear deal. 

At least Europe has guaranteed that [they will stick to the deal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-eu-idUSKBN1940WB) in any case.

But even if nothing bad happens it still is a major blow to moderates' position in Iran. "
"That's laughable, the Israeli influence in US politics is huge. You literally cannot be elected to the Republican nomination if you don't suck their dick and pretend Israel is some super-vital and essential ally. 

Look at all the lobbying money too, and where it comes from."
"Yea, I've read the report. It doesn't change what I said.

These all pretty much revolve around Osama Bassnan, who had worked for the Saudi government and received money from a Saudi Prince multiple times. Bassnan and his wife gave money to two of the hijackers. The House of Saud has 15,000 members and 2,000 of those hold power and wealth. One guy giving money to a guy that then gave money to the hijackers isn't concrete evidence of Saudi involvement. People having other people's phone numbers isn't evidence either. Even the people that worked on the report agree that the report is filled with unverified information:

> ""Meanwhile Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton, who were chairman and vice-chairman of the 9/11 commission, emphasised that the 28 pages had been written before they started their investigation. “The 9/11 Commission was created, in part, to finish the work the congressional panel had begun,” they said in a joint statement.

> The 28 pages from 2002 were “based almost entirely on raw, unvetted material that had come to the FBI”, they added. “That material was then written up in FBI files as possible leads for further investigation. As of June 2003 none of these leads had been checked out. The documents are therefore comparable to preliminary law enforcement notes, which are generally covered by grand jury secrecy rules.”""

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/15/911-report-saudi-arabia-28-pages-released

Was Saudi Arabia the perpetrators of 9/11? I don't know. But I am glad that the government isn't making official policies based off of these 28 pages. "
"Yeah, I'm not afraid of ghosts or bigfoot either, how silly of me. "
"[Bill Clinton Helped Rehab Saudi's Image After 9-11](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/09/23/clinton_ally_reveals_how_bill_clinton_helped_rehab_the_saudis_after_911_131883.html)

>As President Obama prepares to veto legislation giving the families of 9/11 victims the right to sue Saudi Arabia, a prominent and devoted Clinton loyalist, Joe Conason, reveals in his new book how **Bill Clinton worked to rehab the Saudi image in return for tens of millions of dollars.**

>In early 2004, Bill Clinton quietly agreed to help the Saudi Arabian ruling family in their revolting attempts to rehab the Kingdom's besmirched image.  Once considered a strong American ally, **Saudi Arabia was widely condemned after shocking revelations about the role of Saudi nationals in implementing and financing 9/11**. The kingdom needed a new look, a new brand.

>And the former president was all too willing to offer his prestige to take on that dubious, but ultimately lucrative assignment.

--snip--

>And it's no surprise. Recall that **15 of the 19 hijackers from 9/11 were Saudi citizens.**

>And that the **FBI found convincing evidence that Saudi citizens living in the U.S. -- including the wife of the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. -- provided money to support a number of the hijackers while they were in the United States.""**

But none of that bothered Bill Clinton. Not at all. Business is business and he saw the large piggy bank that was waiting at the end of the expansive Arabian Desert.

>According to Joe Conason's new book, ""Man of the World,"" Bill Clinton accepted the invitation of the **then Crown Prince, now King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, who offered his jet to bring Clinton and an entourage of dozens of his cronies to Saudi Arabia.** Amr al-Dabbagh, a Saudi businessman joined in the invitation, which included featuring Clinton at the Jeddh Economic Forum, where **Clinton's appearance could easily be interpreted as an imprimatur of the Kingdom, whether he wanted it to be or not.**

>The king and his friend were no strangers to Clinton.  Saudi Arabia had donated between $10 and 25 million to the Clinton Foundation. (The Clinton Foundation only reports donations in ranges.) And **Dabbagh had paid Clinton $900,000 for three speeches**
just a few months earlier, and ponied up more later. It was a match made in heaven.

"
We make policy based off far less - invading Iraq for example. Global politics is rarely conducted in the open with an easy to follow paper trail. Understanding the totality of Saudi behavior in all aspects of world affairs will lead you to the conclusion that they cause more harm than they are worth.
"Well fuck - Bigfoot killed hundreds of Americans in Iraq and, finances a bunch of terrorist groups, and just got stopped from attempting terror attacks in New York? 

Who knew?"
"I don't know what Clinton has to do with Saudi Arabia being behind 9/11, and the other stuff is just a re-hash from the 9/11 commission, which I've already said was unverified and not investigated information. "
"You keep denying complicity, but a court of law has found the 9-11 families have standing to sue Saudi Arabia.  Business interests are against the lawsuits because they are corporate whores who don't give a damn about the attacks.  Our government is resistant because of the massive Saudi holdings in the US.  And then we have Bill Clinton, whore turd-polisher for cash.  

I stand with the 9-11 families in their pursuit of justice.  The courts recognized standing and you continue to deny complicity.  Good luck with that.

>The families of 9/11 victims will finally have their day in court, as a lawsuit filed Monday seeks to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for their role in the attacks, despite the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations’ all-too-cozy relationship with the Saudi government. The suit says that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA),

>*“raised, laundered and paid substantial financial support to al Qaeda to fund its budget and terrorist activities, including the preparation and execution of the September 11th Attacks [… and] actively supported al Qaeda in its final preparations for the September 11th Attacks through a network of the Kingdom’s officer, employees and/or agents who met with and aided the hijackers.”*

>New York local news outlet, PIX11 reported on the details of the suit, saying that Saudi officials supported two hijackers in the 18-months leading up to September 11, 2001:

>*“The officials allegedly helped them find apartments, learn English and obtain credit cards and cash. The documents state that the officials helped them learn how to blend into the American landscape.”*

>The suit even goes on to show that a Saudi official was in the same Virginia hotel with some of the hijackers the night before the attacks. The Saudis in power sought to fund and support the attacks in an attempt to gain support from religious fundamentalists in the kingdom, according to the lawsuit, using evidence from the FBI’s investigation into the 9/11 attacks.

>The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhatten by Kreindler & Kreindler, an aviation law firm, and lays out how Saudi royals funneled funds to Osama bin Laden through terrorist-friendly charities. Attorney Jim Kreindler told PIX11: “The charities were alter egos of the Saudi government.”

>The suit was recently made possible by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), which was passed in September of 2016. President Obama vetoed the bill only to see the Senate vote 97-1 to override the President’s authority and pass the bill anyway. In his veto, Obama said that the bill would “create complications in our relationships with even our closest partners.” Shamefully, the President was likely worried that we may upset one of our key petroleum and weapons trade partners.

>As the bill was being passed, DTN pointed to the economy as Obama’s reasoning behind his veto:

>*“Estimates put the figure of official Saudi assets in the government at somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion when considering potential foreign bank deposits and offshore accounts.*

>The kingdom had $96.5 billion in holdings of Treasury securities in August, according to the most recent number released by the Treasury Department. Saudi Arabia ranked 15th in its holdings of U.S. Treasury debt.”

>General Electric, Dow Chemical, Boeing, Chevron, as well as several firms hired directly by Saudi Arabia lobbied against the bill, putting business interests before justice.

>While the 9/11 families are battling Saudi Arabia in court, the Saudi government is now funding a devious PR campaign to dupe US veterans into protesting JASTA in Washington, DC. Ring of Fire reported on the dastardly plan earlier in March. Qorvis MSLGROUP, a PR firm operated by the Saudi Arabian government, has recruited veterans to travel to Washington, DC – paying for dinners, drinks, and a stay in the plush Trump International Hotel – in a ploy to have the veterans pressure Congress to gut JASTA. The veterans are falsely told that JASTA could open up individual American soldiers to lawsuits for their acts in military actions. “JASTA poses no risk of exposing U.S. service members to lawsuits in foreign courts. JASTA deals only with the immunity of foreign states, not individuals,” according to William S. Dodge, an international law expert and law professor at UC-Davis.

>The fight over JASTA and the lawsuit against the Saudi government risk upsetting an uncomfortably cozy relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia. The relationship was developed during the 1973 oil crisis and fostered under George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Bush sought to keep the oil flowing between the United States and Saudi Arabia, even after 9/11, while Obama sold over $115 billion in weapons to the kingdom during his administration.

>Hall of Fame Trial Lawyer and television and radio host Mike Papantonio says that it is shameful that the wishes of the Saudi government have been placed before the needs of the 9/11 victims:

>*“The love relationship between the Saudis and the US government has got to take a back seat in uncovering the truth about the Saudi involvement in the mass murder of 3,000 Americans on American soil. Both Bush and Obama have protected their Saudi pals for far too long.”*

>James Riches, a retired firefighter that lost his son in the attacks, echoed those sentiments in an interview with Pix11, “The Obama and Bush administrations have done nothing but fight the 9/11 families for 15 years. The United States government took the side of the Saudis over the 9/11 families.”

>Following in the footsteps of his predecessors, President Trump recently approved a multi-million dollar deal to send even more arms to the kingdom. The same deal was halted by President Obama last year, after more than 60 lawmakers from House of Representatives opposed the deal, citing human rights violations and possible war crimes committed by Saudi Arabia in their attacks against Yemini rebels. Trump had previously spoken out against the Saudi government for their role in 9/11, but it seems that oil and money have pushed aside his concerns.

>In addition to political hurdles, the victims’ families are gearing up for a long and arduous legal battle over the lawsuit. The firm bringing the suit says in a statement:

>*“The KSA will fight the case very hard.  We anticipate its lawyers will challenge JASTA on Constitutional grounds and will seek to dismiss the case alleging that there is not sufficient evidence that it bears responsibility for the 9/11 attacks. […] [W]e we must convince the court that the KSA provided material support to al Qaeda and we face a well-funded and determined foe.”*

Yes Iran was supporting Nelson Mandela back when the US had listed him as a ""terrorist"" too and while Israel was trying to sell nukes to the racist pariah Apartheid regime in S Africa https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/23/israel-south-africa-nuclear-weapons

Do you have anything to contribute? Because frankly no one cares about your bitter foot stomping and name-calling. 

Oh and FYI the only people who are the victims of *an actual, real genocide*, are the Palestinians at the hands of the Israelis.

Do you think it is an accident that an extra 2 million people are shoved into the world's largest open air prison called Gaza?"

"Certain sects of Iran aren't. Particularly the people. However, there's a distinct line between the govt and people. In Iran's situation, there's also a distinct line in the govt. There's President Rouhani and the supreme leader of Iran which has since delegated his powers agmost several organizations. The most concerning one would be the revolutionary guards. These are the guys that U.S. propaganda specifically targets. These are the ones that seeks to limit all forms of westernization; including many things that are progressive like women's rights and the literature you like. They are, afterall, created not to defend Iranians, but the Islamic system. 

Rouhani is not just battling the U.S. here, he's also battling the Revolutionary guard. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10511703/Irans-Revolutionary-Guard-head-hits-out-at-Hassan-Rouhanis-government.html.

It'll be exciting to watch since in recent years, the revolutionary guard has taken it's hands off politics but have since come back since Rouhani has been in charge. Western powers & oil are extremely touchy for Iran, specifically the Islamic independence that was created solely out of anti-western altitudes. Western Oil companies are going to be the ones who benefit the most from this deal. The revolutionary guard will have to bite their lip for this all to work. Or else we may see yet another coup since the new Russian deal would circumvent the current western sanctions (meaning the sanctions no longer matter). "
"Before Operation Ajax in 1953 we got along pretty well, then MI6 wanted Mossadeq gone (for nationalizing Iranian oil reserves) and we jumped on that bandwagon.

yeah but they don't have as much oil
That's true. Jews do control the media.
"Actually we only got along with the govt. Pre-1953, the U.S. was also hated though somewhat seen as victims of Britain. From 1921 to 1979, the west supported two dictators that caused havoc among the Islamic community. Before then, it wasn't even U.S. that was on friendly terms.

Because there is a way to use nuclear energy peacefully. If Iran does not want nuclear weapons than why do they refuse to use technologies that cannot possibly be used to make weapons?

">Oh yes, nuclear weapons are good offensive means to use against Hezbollah and Hamas and other artifacts of Iranian influence.

How about this, if you guys promise to stop [assassinating Iranian scientists](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/world/middleeast/book-contends-iranian-scientists-were-killed-by-israeli-mossad.html), Hezbollah and Hamas promise to stop using artifacts of Iranian influence against you.

"Can you give me a cite for that please? Just because you have nuclear energy does not mean you can flip a switch to ""weapons"" and start making weapons grade material with it. Iran CAN, and they also signed the NPT"

I don't recall ever having a conversation with you (or anyone else, really) about this topic and, in fact, I'll take the moment to say that a diplomatic course of action has always been my preferred path.. not to mention that even those who I know support sanctions do so only with the caveat that they would go into effect only if all diplomatic means had been exhausted (i.e. if the upcoming negotiations are somehow proven to be ineffective at stopping Khamenei from acquiring a nuclear weapon).

Anyways, again, please stop trying to project your personal opinions on me and deflecting my original question."

">Huh? Why would Israel stop assassinating Iranian scientists working to develop nuclear weapons for Iran? 

One because they are non combatants.  Israel doesn't like it when civilians are killed, unless those civilians are Goyim apparently.  Two, because they aren't working on nuclear weapons, they are working on nuclear energy.  Three, because an assassination is a terrorist operation, and we know Israel doesn't want to be considered a terrorist state.

>And why do you think Hamas and Hezbollah came after Israel started assassinating Iranian nuclear scientists?

I simply highlighted that both sides are terrorists, and both sides need to stop using terrorism to achieve their ends.

>You're pretty stupid, aren't you.

You aren't very good with tie downs, are you?

"Your username always pops up with the staunch Israel support posts. You know what else I've noticed is common with you and your fellow Israel anti defamation league posts? So much ad hominem it makes me spit on the ground. The fuck is wrong with you? Do you just like making pointless additions that in no way add to your rhetoric, or are you just 14? I'm sorry man but just letting you know, saying stuff like ""you're pretty stupid huh"" makes me think you are the stupid one. Str8 up. I promise you it isn't witty or clever. Quite the opposite. "
So? I doubt they have a clandestine program like Iran has. I bet you Germany would have no problem with complete 100% access to all nuclear facilities and related compounds. Would Iran allow that? 
"We'll since we're talking about invasions what do you say about Iranian backed proxy groups throughout the Middle East?

You're going to sanction the biggest economy in the world?
"Yeah, sure, you go with that. 

Sanctions had nothing to do with the election turn-out and almost immediate move to negotiate. Nothing at all. 

*pats on head*"
"You don't understand... The US economy accounts for 25% of the worlds total GDP, and the US is the worlds largest consumer. The US is also the third largest oil producer and second largest natural gas producer, and there are over 2.4 trillion dollars worth of foreign investments made in the US. 

The US also produces 32% of the worlds corn crops, 50% of the worlds soybean production, and 25% of the worlds wheat export market.

Not to mention that over 60% of the worlds currency reserves are in US dollars.

Despite what you think, sanctioning the US is not in the best interest of the global economy."
If you say so. I see an agenda as lopsided as the people you criticize. You're simply the other side of a shit coated coin.
"I am more than happy to share my opinion on the sanctions, but you're dodging the question."
"No you reversed the question and posed it to me, as if it would somehow reveal that I am holding double standards in regards to sanctions.

It didn't, however, as you were operating on a flawed premise to begin with, which led the conversation to devolve into one big pointless tangent. So, for the umpteenth time, unless you'd like to address my original question, I'll prefer to wait for the reply of the user towards whom it was originally leveled."
Apparently not ... One side gets the upper hand and yells at the other side for supposedly suppressing the truth. In this case those opposing Israel or israeli policies.
Yep.
">Oh, so you think the US shouldn't have nuclear weapons? Because they do that,

Source?

> and Israel has its own terrorist practices aswell.

Depends on your definition, but Israel does not intentionally target civilians with no possible military significance. Source that they do.

>And to your second fear, better take everyone's nukes, including Israel and the US', then.

That would also cause instability as any rogue country with nukes would automatically and instantly become a world power. There is simply no way to enforce that outside of unicorn land."
"> Israel doesn't like it when civilians are killed, unless those civilians are Goyim apparently.

Yup. Filthy Jews. Now we know where your disingenuous bullshit comes from."
Provide proof Iran HAS a clandestine program.
"Fundamentally no different from Haganah, Lehi, Irgun and Palmach.

I'm sure it will be utterly delightful to see the mental hoops you jump through to justify the killing of innocent human beings and UN and British dignitaries to force the creation of Israel while condemning those who are doing exactly the same to create Palestine. Im sure you'll be able to offer some smart ass justification for electing terrorists to power while condemning the Palestinians for doing the same. 

The second largest terrorist attack in Israel's history - [The King David Hotel Bombing]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing) was carried By Zionist jews  after all, an act so appalling that Israel opened a special museum dedicated to the terrorist responsible - Menachem Begin, when the museum was opened, Bibi Netanyahu said the victims were at fault for their own deaths for not responding to the advance warning. Vile doesn't begin to describe it, you revel in your own terrorist actions against others while  condemning those who committed terrorism against you. The irony of hypocrisy simply flies over your head doesnt it.

"... But ... you are aware of the fact that Khomeini had to approve his candidature? Or are you as wildly uneducated as you sound?

"Actually, if you look at the deal being signed, Iran hasn't conceded anything more than what was on the table 10 years ago. 

If sanctions are what ""brought them to the table,"" why haven't they given anything more than what they were willing to give a full decade ago? 

Also, the current sanctions regime has had a perverse effect. Average Iranians (who you might accurately allege have little to do with the country's policy making) have been the hardest hit. Actual regime elements (the clericy and IRGC) have actually been strengthened by their newfound dominance over the Iranian economy and the domestic political benefits of ""sanctions busting."" "
">It is important to underline that [11]Iran has offered nothing more in terms of concessions now than what it offered in 2005 [11]. The sanctions [12]did not bring Iran to the negotiating table [12]—Tehran was [13]always there [13]—and the sanctions definitely did not wring out extra concessions from Iran. Basically, were it not for [14]western intransigence [14] and the [13]bad atmospherics [13], the interim deal signed in late 2013 could have been signed in 2005.

"I don't actually have an agenda, I have no personal stake in the conversation. I just enjoy making fun of really obvious bias."
"I'm not dodging anything. He made the assertion that it's a double standard to support sanctions on Israel but not on Iran, and I pointed out that he has the exact same opinion but with the names swapped thus making him a massive hypocrite.

If you want to know why we should sanction Israel more than Iran then you're going to have to give me your reasoning for sanctioning Iran in the first place, because as it is they haven't done anything and so there's nothing to compare."
"If it's a double standard to oppose sanctions on one country but not the other, the same is true for when the names are reversed.

"
"Which is why rational discussion is impossible in this subreddit. I oppose Israel's occupation of Palestine, yet I acknowledge the Israelis have legitimate security concerns. I oppose Iran getting a nuclear weapon, and yet acknowledge their right to peaceful nuclear enrichment.

If I say ""Israel's occupation of Palestine borders on apartheid"", that gets me upvotes and visibility. If I say ""Iran should never get a nuclear weapon"", I'll simply get buried.

Sanctions didn't bring the wall down, but they sure as hell brought Iran to the negotiating table. It's foolish to think otherwise. "
"You just said that the world should sanction the US and that the US is ""big, but not that big"", after I said that sanctioning the US would result in the collapse of the global economy.

You need to learn the definition of the term ""appealing to emotion"" because you clearly don't know what it is. You also need to learn the correct usage of quotation marks because you are using them incorrectly.

It was merely a little puffery to ask you to explain how you are going to eliminate all nuclear weapons in the world, then enforce it.

The entire point of my comment was that not all countries are the same and it is ok for some countries to have nukes and not others. And how that is not hypocritical. If you would like to go back and refute my points, go ahead, but you naming countries with nukes is in no way refuting my point."
"It is part of the NPT, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iran is in *full compliance* with that treaty *and* some of its non-binding extensions. There is *absolutely* no reason to consider them shady in that regard. They have opened their facilities as much as the treaty tells them to. Iran is letting the UN in just as much as the US or Russia."

As for the rogue nations, I'd like to define a rogue nation as an aggressive, hostile nation that constantly tries to influence other countries politically without regards for their wellbeing or political self-determination.

... Wait, thats the US."
ok so they are VERY GOOD liars. 
"I don't care what they'd rather do, I care what they do do. And I disagree. Why did the 9/11 hijackers hit the World Trade Center as opposed to military bases? And if you can't see the difference between killing civilians and attacking with a military objective then I can't help you. But these rules are clearly laid out in international law if you care to look.

You don't get to define the term rogue state. You should use words as they are already defined, otherwise conversations cease to make sense."
"You have killed ten people, you are just a very good liar about it. Now follow me to prison please.

... Do you realize how retarded that sounds? Provide proof or stop calling them liars."
"Because they wanted to break the US morale, I guess, a valid military endeavour, supposedly. Maybe military bases would have been too hard to hit, maybe they thought they'd be shot down, what do I know. All I know is that its just as horrible as killing people with car bombs or in drive-by shootings.

As for rogue states, what are rogue states then? States the US doesn't like?"
Iran is a major player in the region. Israel has nukes. There is no reason to think Iran does not also desire them. Its game theory. Plus they did have a progam
">Because they wanted to break the US morale, I guess, a valid military endeavour, supposedly. Maybe military bases would have been too hard to hit, maybe they thought they'd be shot down, what do I know.

If that's the case, why did they attack the Pentagon? I would think that the Pentagon would have greater protection than many other military structures. And no, killing civilians to weaken morale is not a legitimate military endeavor.

>As for rogue states, what are rogue states then? States the US doesn't like?

[Rogue state is a controversial term applied by some international theorists to states they consider threatening to the world's peace. This means meeting certain criteria, such as being ruled by authoritarian regimes that severely restrict human rights, sponsor terrorism, and seek to proliferate weapons of mass destruction.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_state)

If you would like to make up another term that describes a characteristic of a country that should not have nuclear weapons, and then properly define it, I would be more than happy to discuss it with you, but you do not get to hijack a term and create your own definition."
"Still waiting for proof. Game theory says theory in the name, it can be merely seen as a hint at a possible intention."
"Odd, that definition applies to the US save for the first point and to Iran save for the last point!"
"Except that the US doesn't sponsor terrorism, nor proliferate weapons of mass destruction.

Iran fits the definition if they were trying to create nuclear weapons."
"The US does sponsor terrorism as noted above, and it has nukes, which arguably are weapons of mass destruction."
">The US does sponsor terrorism as noted above,

You didn't note anything. Can you explain a little more?

>and it has nukes, which arguably are weapons of mass destruction.

The definition requires the ""proliferation"" of weapons of mass destruction. The US has been eliminating nuclear weapons for a long time and has not been creating any."
"The US sponsored terrorists in Afghanistan, in south american states, in Syria and god-knows-where.

Saying the US would be eliminating nuclear weapons is technically true, yet highly disingenious considering their existing arsenal that will not be reduced below a certain size."
"The definition (and common sense) dictates that we should be looking at *current* actions.

It is not disingenuous. Is Iran proliferating nuclear weapons because they have a chemical weapon arsenal? It is simply the definition of proliferation."
"So new weapons are more dangerous than old? Or is the definition of rogue state disingenious, discriminatory and unconstructive? ..."
"It's not about which is more dangerous, it's about countries leading to the destabilization of the world peace. New weapons are far more threatening and inflammatory than old ones."
Considering what happened to world peace that is patently wrong. 
The world has gotten more and more peaceful.
"Not due to the US' contribution, which have the ""old"" weapons, and more due to Irans (non-)contribution, which supposedly has the ""new"" weapons."
Sure is. Having a few superpowers is a very stable system compared to no superpowers.
"Stable, but not peaceful. Neither the US nor Russia nor China have been peaceful."
You are less likely to die in a war today than any time in history. That is peace.
"No, that is less war and more localized war than before. Peace would be if everyone could keep his hands for himself."
Well I would say we can thank the US for fewer large international wars than we can blame them for localized warring.
I would say fewer large wars wasn't a result of the US' peacekeeping but rather a necessity of MAD. Its not like they wouldn't have tried to stir the pot as hard as they felt they could.

Obama has enforced the sanctions currently in place.  Clearly, they have been and still are an option.  His statement regards them not being a permanent solution.  However, they remain an option until an acceptable solution can be brought about.  

Snapback sanctions are part of the deal if Iran breaks the deal.  They are an absolutely integral part of the deal.  Do you think he's somehow unilaterally removing this provision by remarking about sanctions not being able to exist into perpetuity?

try to read it once.

These are the parts about The Army and The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps:

9- The Executive Power 
9. 3- The Army and The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps

Article 14: The Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for guarding the independence and territorial integrity of the country, as well as the order of the Islamic Republic. 

Article 144: The Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran must be an Islamic Army, i.e., committed to Islamic ideology and the people, and must recruit into its service individuals who have faith in the objectives of the Islamic Revolution and are devoted to the cause of realizing its goals. 
 
Article 145: No foreigner will be accepted into the Army or security forces of the country. 

Article 146: The establishment of any kind of foreign military base in Iran, even for peaceful purposes, is forbidden. 

Article 147: In time of peace, the government must utilize the personnel and technical equipment of the Army in relief operations, and for educational and productive ends, and the Construction Jihad, while fully observing the criteria of Islamic justice and ensuring that such utilization does not harm the combat-readiness of the Army. 

Article 148: All forms of personal use of military vehicles, equipment, and other means, as well as taking advantage of Army personnel as personal servants and chauffeurs or in similar capacities, are forbidden. 

Article 149: Promotions in military rank and their withdrawal take place in accordance with the law. 

Article 150: The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, organized in the early days of the triumph of the Revolution, is to be maintained so that it may continue in its role of guarding the Revolution and its achievements. The scope of the duties of this Corps, and its areas of responsibility, in relation to the duties and areas of responsibility of the other armed forces, are to be determined by law, with emphasis on brotherly cooperation and harmony among them. 

Article 151: 
In accordance with the noble Qur'anic verse:
(Prepare against them whatever force you are able to muster, and horses ready for battle, striking fear into God's enemy and your enemy, and others beyond them unknown to you but known to God... [8:60]).
the government is oblige to provide a programme of military training, with all requisite facilities, fob all its citizens, in accordance with the Islamic criteria, in such a way that all citizens will always be able to engage in the armed defence of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The possession of arms, however, requires the granting of permission by the competent authorities."
They're technically not wrong at all. Obama's opinion is that the sanctions won't be able to stay in place given an ever changing world. The GOP argument has mainly been about Obama not using Executive powers to enact a bad deal with Iran. Not that a deal can't be made.
"Russia and North Korea, of course! Haven't you seen movies in the last couple years?"

"From what I've heard, the GOP wants no deal and to keep sanctions. Obama wants to spell out a way for them to safely use nuclear power and in turn lift the sanctions that only hurt the civilians, not the government anyways. "
I'm fairly certain any Republican deal would entail the prohibition of Iranian enrichment for any purpose.  No country in it's right mind would accept that.
A sanction that lasts a thousand years? Didn't Caesar say that? 
"America has an inherent interest in stability. 

What happens if Iran starts targeting oil tankers with jet fighters? Saudi crude to the U.S. is disrupted or prevented from reaching the U.S. Millions of barrels of oil spill into the sea. Oil supply to Europe is disrupted. The world economy faulted and crashes. People are homeless and jobless thousands if not millions die prematurely because of the harsh conditions. 

What if Iran begins their Jihad against the Sunnis?

"Yes, that's quite correct. The Neocons are indeed the ones not being reasonable here. The let's-invade-Afghanistan-let's-invade-Iraq-let's-bomb-Iran Necons have never been reasonable or correct in anything they'd ever advocated.

Mother fuckers like John Bolton and William Kristol oughta have the word ""wrong"" forcibly tattooed across their fucking foreheads so that Americans and the rest of the civilized world never forget what happens when we listen to those idiots. "
"The times of Israel?  Give me a break.  Even if we go by your source, Obama isn't ruling out military action.  He's making the obvious point that airstrikes will only delay any program and strengthen the leadership's resolve to pursue nuclear weaponry.  

If by ""military option"" you mean a full scale American invasion with the goal of regime change, you bet your ass that's off the table.  At least until Iran starts attacking other countries.  Americans aren't about to go down that road again.  

Netanyahu complains about a deal and demands military option, all while ignoring the impracticality of such a stance and offering absolutely nothing in the way of viable alternative.

Here he is saying all options are on the table:

Another:
http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Obama-advisor-Military-option-against-Iran-still-on-the-table-396363

Googling ""Obama all options on the table"" brings up many, many more.

Please tell me you're joking with that second source.  It does not state that snapback sanctions were forced on Obama by Congress.  It very clearly states that Obama opposed Congress implementing additional sanctions (that is, in addition to anything proposed in the deal as well as in addition to any currently in effect).  Republicans wants to impose more sanctions for the same reason they sent a letter to Iran, political points with an important international issue.  

The snapback provision has been conceived by the Western powers involved in the negotiations and supported by the US negotiating team.  This was not something pushed on them by Republicans who think they're more important than they are.  

The real issue is whether Russia and China will accept that, as they traditionally oppose such automatic measures.  The US (Obama) wants the sanctions to snap back without having to deal with a Security Council veto.  I believe some progress has been made on this front in recent discussions.

You're not letting any future failure speak for itself, you're speaking for it right now and posting bogus sources as support, in addition to wildly inaccurate statements about the intentions of the US and European powers.

Deadlines are self imposed.  If they don't have everything hammered out by the end of June, it's not an automatic failure of the entire process.

"I could point out the fact that ""spreading our values"" has clearly been an excuse for expanding our power and pursuing our interests.

I could highlight the fact that your understanding of Iran is based on an amalgam of a decade long propaganda campaign intended to characterize people from Africa to East Asia with the same broad stroke of xenophobia and hatred.

I could mention that of the surrounding Muslim nations, Iran is the most modernized and stable. That it has the highest percentage of college graduates, the majority of whom are women. That it is perhaps one of the only countries left in the region that we haven't already decimated and presents perhaps the last glimmer of genuine hope for progress from within in the Middle East.

But everything about what you've just written indicates to me that it would fall on deaf ears. So honestly, disregard everything I just said and ask yourself one simple question:

*How does what you just stated differ from what anyone going into war anywhere has ever said?*"
"> That alone makes us morally superior to them.

except for the US propensity for all the nations constantly destroyed, more wars being started and escalated everywhere, resources looted, the millions of people murdered, the thousands tortured.

None of which Iran does (other than a number of executions and torturing), make US ""moral superiority"" seem absolutely non-existent.

"No. Iran did not invade Yemen. I'm not sure where you're getting your information.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Liberation_Act

President George W. Bush often referred to the Act and its findings to argue that the Clinton Administration supported regime change in Iraq and further that it believed that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. The Act was cited as a basis of support in the Congressional Authorization for use of Military Force Against Iraq in October 2002.[8]

The bombing is indefensible, for sure.  However, it occurred during US intervention in Lebanese affairs.  It was not exactly an attack in a vacuum and it sure as hell wasn't an indication that today, in 2015, Iran is hell bent on world domination."

It's not that Iran isn't responsible for shit that happened 20 years ago. It's the fact that they didn't have a relationship with Hezbollah when that bombing occurred.

>Senator Joe Lieberman, one of the sponsors of the resolution, said it is intended ""to say clearly and resolutely to Iran: You have only two choices – peacefully negotiate to end your nuclear program or expect a military strike to end that programme.""

>Critics of the resolution said that it smacks of a congressional authorisation for an attack on Iran. That view was reinforced when the sponsors declined a request from some Democrats to amend it to clarify that the resolution did not imply consent for war.

The Obama administration knows that it's illegal to launch a war without Congress approval, unless it's just about drones and torture and that type of stuff, which it can do without anyone's approval (see Somalia, Libya...). But a full scale war... you need Congress for that. Hey, Lieberman! You crazy war mongering fuck, come here you!

Everyone knows sanctions won't do anything to stop Iran from developing nukes if they want to. That's not the point. The point is that Israel has nukes, the US has them, Russia, Pakistan, North Korea... hell, my aunt has nukes. No one's crazy enough to actually use them, it's only a tool for regional control. And yes, Iran wants to control the region. So does everyone, including the US, which is, strangely enough, thousands of miles away from the region. And Israel already controls the region, but they get to, because their skin is pale enough not to be evil.

*""We'd rather use diplomacy and sanctions... we really don't want to go to war unless it's absolutely necessary... we're pacifists! The fact that we have two (soon three) carrier groups in the Persian Gulf, are sending troops there, and have just upped our financial and military aid to Israel has nothing to do with it. We're angry at them, and that's the real reason why we're giving them more guns!""*

It's like a reality show: entirely scripted.

Cue the anti-war protests, and cue the government suppressing and ignoring said protests. It's 2003 and we're attacking Iraq again! WMDs! Terrorism! NINE ELEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN! HOLOCAUST!  NO INTEREST FOR 6 MONTHS! BIGGER CUP HOLDERS! iPhone 5!"

Now imagine an entire country built with this foundation with technological support from a Superpower because of decades of calculated lobbying and government infiltration. I'll be frank, there is a reason Jews get targeted in every major civilization but ironically Muslims treated them the best. Once America leaves the Middle East which will happen..

"> Noam Chomsky once said that the greatest threat the the USA and her allies imposed by Iran having nukes, would be Iran's ability to have a deterrent to US aggression in the region.

That's completely wrong though. A deterrent means having enough nukes that you are guaranteed the ability to retaliate after a first strike. Deterrents are stabilising forces. You need a lot of nukes to have a viable deterrent. This is something the US and USSR had in the 80's and 90's. 

Unfortunately Iran is not able to afford that many nukes. Neither is North Korea. Now North Korea has China to back them up and artillery which threatens Seoul. So the US is not going to attack them.

However Iran is different. They are in transition state to having a small number of nukes which would be a lethal threat to Israel in a first strike. However those nukes are still somewhat vulnerable to an Israeli or US first strike. You probably can't destroy their nuclear program because it is too dispersed. However once they have their small ICBM stock you can destroy that on the ground if they look like they will use it. And you can shoot down the ones you miss with missile defence.

So Iranian ICBMs are not a deterrent. All it would take is Ahmadinejad to mouth off sufficiently for Israel to consider an Iranian first strike to be a possibility and I'd expect an Israeli first strike.

Basically Iran is slowly (and very ostentatiously) building a knife and taking it to a gunfight.

> Kids this is not a black and white situation- do not be provoked into labelling an enemy so easily.

I'd quite agree. Not all nuclear arsenals are the same. Big ones act as strategic stabilisers. Small ones are destabilising.

Interestingly the USSR had a dangerously small arsenal in the 50's - a dozen or so land based ICBMs and no subs. And, not surprisingly, there were people in the US who advocated a first strike to destroy it. The US being the US doesn't do things by halves and has always had a large survivable arsenal which was always a strategic stabiliser once they faced nuclear armed adversaries."

Not a chance in hell with all the American military hardware they possess. I'm more worried about Israel having nuclear weapons than Iran.
"Not at all likely. There exists no clear path between Israel and Iran, meaning that it's almost inevitable that the Arab states would be all to happy to get involved in a war between the two states they hate most.

Even if the USA were to distance themselves from talk about an invasion they will still stand strong with Israel on boarder security. This means that if Iran were to attack Israel, they would get messed up horribly by all the nearby US forces."

Their fear is that in the future Israelis will look back at someone like Netanyahu and be astonished at how left wing he was. Scary thought.

From what I've been reading, clusterbombs are dropped from low altitudes and many of the bomblets don't fuse fast enough to explode when they hit something, lying in the ground for years until someone without the proper care pick it up.

Edit: a few comas here and there, nothing more."
"Israel still refuses to provide maps of the landmines and cluster bombs they planted as well, a despicable crime against humanity for a supposedly civilised nation.

[Relevant: “Waltz With Bashir”](http://www.solidarity-us.org/site/node/2257) 
Not only that but as the IDF retreated they peppered the ground with bomblets in civilian areas so when children would go out to play they'd pick up the bomblets because they look like toys and they'd get blown up.

"Are you kidding? Do you know how much restraint Israel used in that war?
You have no idea of Israel's real firepower, it could have flattened southern Lebanon in a second, but it didn't. It didn't do it even though for a whole month all of northern Israel was bombarded constantly. 

I want to see California being under fire for a month, and its civillians forced to live in shelters. I'm sure US wouldn't have let that happen, and would have acted much more harshly than Israel did. 

People just fail to realize how much caution Israel uses to avoid hurting uninvolved civilians. Sure, sometimes they do get killed, but when terrorists launch missiles from homes and schools, the blame is on the terrorists.

Sure, it's always easy to blame Israel, when you're safe wherever you are. But I want to see your country's reaction when a third of its area is bombarded. No other country does as much to prevent civilians casualties on the other side, while in fact, Israeli civilians and cities were targeted the entire war."

Two additional soldiers, believed to have been killed outright or mortally wounded, were taken by Hezbollah to Lebanon.[32][33][34] Five more were killed in a failed rescue attempt. Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery fire on targets in Lebanon that damaged Lebanese civilian infrastructure, including Beirut's Rafic Hariri International Airport,[35] an air and naval blockade,[36] and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon.

"It's strange how every year, the number just keeps getting higher and higher. I'm not sure where you got that figure of 1,900 civilians but it is not remotely accurate.

The total number of Lebanese deaths (both civilians and combatants), depending on whose estimates you trust, [ranges between 800 and around 1200.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War#Lebanese_civilians)

Out of those, the total number of combatants (including Hezbollah + other combatants), again, depending on which estimate you trust, [sits in the 550-1000 range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War#Hezbollah).

That means that the absolute *maximum* number of Lebanese civilians killed was 650, but the real number was almost definitely far lower than that  - probably in the 300 to 400 range."
"They had suffered like a decade of sanctions. And we pulled some crazy jujitsu on them. And they were a bit demoralized from losing so hard to Iran, then being bombed by US several times in Desert Shield/Storm and Clinton's bombing campaign. Then the occupation was costly as hell. So, yeah, we technically beat their military, but the war lasted years. Even if we were to do the same to Iran, the occupation would be far worse than Iraq."
"Keep in mind though, that was a bloody bloody war. An entire generation was nearly annihilated which has given Iran it's comparatively large youth bulge at around 1/3 of the population under 29 years old. They face the same problems most young people face today, namely unemployment and a tenuous relationship with their government. There's a trend within Iranian young people to resist the authoritarian nature and I think a great new Persian culture can sprout from them.

But the easiest way to dash any ideas of an open middle east is to attack them and galvanize an entire generation looking for purpose into a fighting one that will make peace in the future a distant dream. They are live in a place in the world where militant groups can outlast even the sophisticated armies easily. If war happens it'll become a breeding ground for radicals and insurgencies all around the fragile peace in some places.

This is why I feel to defeat radical religious groups is not through violence, because at the point radicals are at they only understand two things: their faith and violence. If you take away all their regular comforts with bombs and destroy their homes the only thing they'll have in the end is their faith/philosophy and anger. You can't take that away from anyone no matter how powerful you are. Then when these pissed of people look for groups to fight against the occupation of their country with they'll find plenty of groups that have existed for decades.

I'm rambling, but if Iran was ever invaded and the government toppled it's not victory for Israel or the West, it's a victory for every radical terrorist group in the middle east looking for new recruits."

"I have to disagree with you. When Jewish people say 'Jewish', it is more of a religious attitude rather than a race issue.

Most Jews are Ashkenazi which are so distantly related to the semitic background, you may as well call them african and refer them to the fertile crescent. Ashkenazi are white Jews from Poland, Russia, and the Ukraine.

There's way more of them than there are true semitic Jews which  have the same genetic background as the Palestinians, so really, the only difference is their religious backgrounds.

"First, the NPT came about after Israel already had nuclear technology and its nuclear weapons program. They didn't skirt around it so that they could develop nuclear weapons.

Should Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea be forced to join the NPT or deal with severe global sanctions? Yes, absolutely. All nuclear nations should play by the same rules or be ostracized from the global community.

Even with that said, that still doesn't make their nuclear stock piles illegal.

So long as their actions are not endangering others the rest of the world can't ""legally"" do shit."

I'm not surprised that this incident led Israel to initiate a large-scale operation against Hezbullah."
"Hezbollah launched rockets at Israel long before Israel attacked Lebanon.

"Sweet! I am sure Israel won't waste any time trying to sabotage this deal, being the war-mongering scum bags they are."
The sanctions were over Iran's nuclear weapons program.  So unless you're prognosticating Iranian nukes showing up in the hands of Hamas and Hezbollah this isn't really an argument against lifting those sanctions vs. waging war on Iran.
"An allowance that is mandatory to be outsourced to American companies in Israel, which also returns to the US in the form of weapons, medicine and other tech"
It's not. They get 3bil/year as part of Egypt peace deal. Egypt gets funds too. They want more this year for missile defense to offset funds given to Iran.
There has been talk about Obama permanently increasing it to $5bln
"I'm saying Iran's sanctions being lifted means the money flowing into their economy will lead to weapons in the hands of Hezbollah and Hamas. 
"
Mostly weapons.
The money in my left pocket is different to my right?
Baloney. Cut em off.
Would you rather Palestine's [ISIS-affiliated groups](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/01/14/isis-in-gaza/) get more money and supplies instead?  It's not like Iran being out of the picture means anti-Israel groups won't get funding from other sources--more extreme ones at that.
Israel is the only democracy in the middle East that supports equal rights for all religions and lgbtq. They deserve the funds.
"I'm against all terrorist groups getting funding.

Consider me old fashioned."
I don't want to support their settlement expansion plan **with taxpayer dollars**. 
Whats the alternative though? Leave Iran to its own devices unsupervised or pull them into the world fold once again? 
I'll just consider you unrealistic. 
"That's very noble of you, but since you don't live in an old-fashioned vacuum where you can snap your fingers and terrorism goes away, it's probably prudent not to cripple the only Middle Eastern power that's actually trying to counter-balance ISIS.

"Whenever we fund one terrorist group to take on another we create a new problem which sticks its head up years down the line. 

The Mujahideen were fighters the United States funded as a resistance force against the Soviets in the middle east. They went on to become the Taliban and al qaeda years down the line. 

Whenever we allow one terrorist group to get funding so they can fight another terrorist group, we fuck up. This isn't an opinion, this is literally what caused the last 20 years of bullshit we are currently still dealing with."
"You can fight ISIS without funding terrorist organizations.

The west used that system for decades and all they did was prop up new terrorist groups which went on to replace the old ones. Your logic is flawed and outdated. We tried it your way and we created the Taliban and al qaeda. They were Mujahideen fighters who the United States funded when the Soviets were in Afghanistan.

Guess how that turned out?"
You explain how Israel is the same as ISIS and al qaeda and you've validated your point.
"It's not the cost, it's what they do with the money and arms."
"Not saying we should fund a terrorist group. I completely oppose us doing so. That's not what we're discussing here. We also shouldn't cripple economies just because ""if they have money some small percentage may go to terrorism."" Giving people more reasons to hate us in order to prevent terrorism is a terrible idea. "
"> You can fight ISIS without funding terrorist organizations.

Do you think I'm the government of Iran?  Who are you directing this comment at?  I never suggested we fund terrorist organizations to fight ISIS, but only that fighting ISIS while *also* picking a fight with the only other country actually trying to fight ISIS too is a bad idea.  That's not the logic that props up terrorist groups but rather the logic that avoids wars on multiple fronts and realizes that politics requires you to pick priorities.  And yes, I think fighting the guys that just killed 200,000 Syrians and created a refugee crisis is a bigger priority than Mullahs that waste their money in Palestine.

Your logic leads to the war in Iraq.  How'd that turn out?"
"Id say Israel has easily murdered more unarmed civilians with bombs. They have an insane religious agenda driven by unreasoning extremists, and are quite prepared to punish use terror for political purposes. And they are supported by bloodthirsty fanatics brainwashed by a bronze-age world view. 

The important similarity is a complete disregard for human life, and belief god is on their side and of course frequent breaking of international law. Israel, ISIS & Al Qaeda are vicious murdering bastards - all three intimately connected to US foreign policy with regard to oil - but only one openly funded and enabled by it.

Israel spends the money on Missile Defense. This is not a weapon but a counter defensive measure that cant be used on populations.

They can buy their own missiles they're not broke.
"You are aware that there is a substantial difference between many ( or even most) of a country's citizens hating us and all of them hating us right? It's also not a static factor. You can actually change how many people hate you through actions. Even reducing how much individuals hate us is probably a security improvement. 

Not saying you have to be super nice and polite to Iran, but if you actually want to makes things safer, instead of just make your self feel like you've got a bigger dick, you're advocating dumb policy."
"I think definitelyjoking's larger argument was that Iran shouldn't be reduced to ""terrorist group"" like say, the Mujahideen.  As usual, though, you seem to have missed the point."
"Man, what a waste of a Babka-themed account."
I am not sure you are aware but we have lots of troops in Korea to protect allies. Confronting threats in the middle east is to protect allies. You can call helping allies a bad thing but Israel is the cornerstone of US foreign policy in a region without many reliable allies for the US. 
"""They can buy their own missiles they're not broke.""  What makes you think the US wants Israel to buy or fully produce its own missiles and other major weapons systems? "
"The ayatollah chants death to America. He is the supreme leader of the country. The controller of their military and the decider of all electoral candidates. 

Your argument doesn't make sense. "
"I think you should stick to your own discussions. 

When you say something worthwhile I'll respond to it."
"But he never claimed they were. Just that they have a history of funding terrorist groups, and more money =  more funding.

I don't think that makes the whole country a terrorist nation, but the point made is still a pretty sound one."
"Israel exacerbates the tensions in the middle east. I say cut them loose. If they had to pay for every bullet, missile, and bomb themselves they might not be so trigger happy. "
Your argument assumes that the threat of terrorism is entirely from state leaders rather than politically powerless citizens. Terrorism is a big recruitment drive. Don't increase the number of easy recruits. Just how bad is your understanding of terrorism? 
lol ok Mr. tough Babka.

Enjoy the last word.
You mean Saudi Arabia? The largest funder of terrorism? You're also overly obsessed with funding as opposed to recruiting. Small arms just aren't that pricey. 
Did you just accuse me of trying to have the last word while...getting in the last word?  Babka you gotta do better than that. The real question now is whether you can resist responding to this.
"Again, 

One doesn't excuse the other. Using your logic child molestation is totally Kosher because Pakistan allows child marriage. 

One doesn't validate the other. "
"Following your logic we should sanction Saudi Arabia to reduce money for terror funding. Do you advocate that? If you don't, your position is inconsistent. That's what I'm pointing out. 

You also don't have much of a response to the recruitment vs. money priority. "
"I said, ""One doesn't excuse the other"". 

I could give a shit what happens to Saudi Arabia. My point is your logic of validating the wrongs of Iran by citing the wrongs of other countries is bullshit logic.

We'd literally lose civilized society overnight if your logic was how individuals carried about their business.

"This oil sanctions are a massive stupidity. This will not end well.

- The weakest economies in the Euro zone, like Greece or Spain, were importing a large share of their fossil energy from Iran. As if they haven't had enough difficulties with their austerity.
- India's energy demand is as high as never before. The recent blackouts showed that they are currently running over their margins. I think they are beginning to regretting going along with the sanctions.
- Japan also has big problems since most of their nuclear power was shut down after Fukushima. They rely much more on fossil fuel now.
- It is expected that food prices will rise this year due to bad weather. Bad corn harvest in the US will cause a price spike in biofuels and the Russians are thinking about to stop wheat exports because of this years fires. 

The Saudis are the only reason why this didn't blow up to major shit storm proportions yet. But how long can they keep up with pumping? We are lucky that the oil prices are comparatively  low, but reduction of viable suppliers reduces resilience in the markets. We are only one black swan event away from a major clusterfuck."
What I DON'T understand is why the Americans don't pressure Israel on their nuclear program. How do you expect Iran and other states to take you seriously ?

"Although you raise some valid points, this not really how the global oil market works. 

The main thing you are missing is that oil production isn't anywhere near ""maxed out"". If oil rises in price, producers will produce more because 1) their profits will be greater, and 2) the marginal cost of producing oil in some places (mostly in the Americas and Asia) will be overcome by the increased price. 

Middle East oil is the cheapest to produce, so item 2) is irrelevant for it. The only thing Iran considers to maximize its profit is price, and the sanctions (whether we like them or not) have dropped the price Iran can sell its oil for due to a limited market. In fact, other oil producers like the price increase from a drop in effective supply. But prices don't get crazy high because more producers come online as it makes sense for them to. And Iran gets the shaft because they can't get the going rate for their exports because their selling options are limited and they are forced to sell at a discount. The sanctions really have isolated the effect on Iran; that some countries in Asia get around the embargo was fully expected and doesn't mean it hasn't had a significant impact on Iran.

The real winners are the other countries that produce oil, and those that get Iran's oil at a discount. The real loser is Iran, or any country that becomes addicted to Middle East oil as a result of the temporary discount on Iran's oil. And the rest of the world is relatively unaffected.

**tl;dr** The world isn't supply constrained on oil and Iran only produces 5% of the total. Sanctions designed against Iran have produced effects largely localized on Iran."

How much power do you really think get's generated from crude oil?
"A lot of that simply isn't true:

Greece and Italy (not sure about Spain) are exempt from the embargo for those reasons.

The blackout was not caused by India's joining the embargo. It had nothing to do with actual power, more a technical failure it is being assumed.

The Japanese are beginning to reopen their plants.

The food prices thing is true. Although don't just take for granted that a catastrophe will happen to the Americans and Russians. 

The sanctions are in fact working, and tremendously. The Americans and EU were by far Iran's biggest customers, and the punishment is being felt in force."

"It depends on how long the Saudi,Qatari and other gulf arab countries regimes last. These disgusting and despicable governments are tightly linked to the US government. They are servants of Americans. Unlike Iran they have no knowledge industry and are consumers of everything. They are totally reliant on Oil and when that goes all of that area will turn into empty sands with billion dollar toys and empty shells that were once called cities. 

However they make the life of their people so easy that by most standards they are lazy,unknowledgeable and arrogant. They hire Asian servants to do everything for them and the level of type two diabetes is high. They're mentality is to let others do things for them. 

The government keeps control because they can always bribe people with money,cheap petrol and if needs be whip up Islamic sectarian sentiments. So far these governments are gaining strength by portraying Iran as a country with evil intentions on Arabs and Syria as a country ruled by an evil Shia oppressing Sunnis (even though most Sunnis actually do support the government and they are the ones who are leading the fightback against the FSA).

It's actually quite sad as a Sunni Muslim to see these guys. They have no sanctions placed on them and yet they're only worth on this earth comes from a luck of nature/God depending on how you look at it. Other countries with Oil like Norway and Iran have other industries. 

Iran which has some of the heaviest sanctions in the world and is less richer has more investment in Science and Technology. They spent time educating their people about Birth controls and are now worried about population growth being to low. Gulf States are growing 3x times faster and seem to be doing nothing about it. Even the religous clerics are worried about how less people in Iran are reading books now days.

A qoute from an Iranian Cleric
""“The society places greater value on sandwiches than it does on books! Book reading has not received enough publicity over the past years. Some only read and study books for financial gain and consider book reading a profession, which is a pity. We need to promote reading in a way to develop logical and rational thinking” 

And a qoute from Syriana that I think says everything about the Gulf
""You know what the business community thinks of you? They think that a hundred years ago you were living in tents out here in the desert chopping each other's heads off and that's where you'll be in another hundred years, so, yes, on behalf of my firm I accept your money. """
"There's every possibility that we are seeing not the decline of the American Empire, but rather, its rise. Invading Iraq was a major turning point.

"I don't know about that, but I think that Russia and China are the only countries that have the capacity to stand up to the US.

Sometimes I feel like political world events are a game between governments, and the common civilian doesn't matter, like a cell in a human body."
Oh the same China and Russia that's currently backing Assad in Syria?
"I also think it's important to note the difference between ""supply"" and ""capacity."" Although there's plenty of oil in the Earth to go around for generations, there's only so much we can produce per day -- and the demand for oil keeps increasing, thereby giving us a shortage. Important distinction for these types of debates. "
"> fungible

You didn't read the last paragraph, didn't you? What if something unexpected happens to the Saudi oil supply? How fast can other suppliers rise their output to meet the demand? Are they even able to do that? How does the price hike affect global economy? The indisputable fact is: More suppliers=More stability.

> Nothing to do with supply of energy, a cat got zapped and India has terrible infrastructure. You could drown the country in crude oil and it wouldn't change a thing.

India's bad infrastructure causes a shift to private energy supply. Everyone with the need has to acquire a generator to prevent shortages caused by blackouts. Those generators will run on fossil fuels. Hence, the dependency and demand of fossils fuel will also rise.

> Irrelevant to Iranian oil output.

But, you brought up the fungibility argument! Also, if the food supply gets more restricted, then it means countries near Russia have to buy it from somewhere else. And then you have to ship the stuff over long distances which needs, as you know, fossil fuels. This will causes higher food prices and, as the events in the Arab world had shown, this isn't something you want if you're interested in stability."

"The question is how much longer are those sanctions sustainable, if other countries begin to think they can't afford participating in the sanctions regime anymore?

"Exactly!  Natural Gas sure, but oil not so much."
"Yes. Money talks. If there was a pro-Iran lobby as wealthy as AIPAC, Romney would probably be campaigning there too :D"
"So basically the situation is like this:

Iran has signed an agreement not to get nuclear weapons. There hasn't been any proof of them trying to get such weapons (according to the IAEA reports). Still they do face massive pressure from the US (and its ""allies"") because people suspect that they are about to break this agreement and get nukes anyway.

Israel, on the other hand, has never even signed any such agreement. They simply got the nukes without asking anyone's permission. So apparently this is okay because they never made any promises to begin with?

So basically if Iran withdrew from the NPT they wouldn't be any more obliged than any other country (such as Israel) not to possess nukes. Then there wouldn't be any possibility of NPT to be broken. Somehow I don't think it's too likely that this pressure and saber rattling would suddenly end in this scenario."

"They are getting pretty brazen in the south china sea.  But at least in theory they are pressing actual territorial disputes.  At issue here is that the UNSC has not sanctioned the Iranian banking system, it's purely domestic US law.  This is a unilateral act of trade war against China, a very small one, though.  I almost wonder if this is just something of an experiment to see how China responds.  "
"No, the US wants Iran to be a good boy and continue to sell its oil for dollars. 

And if you check media coverage for the last 20 years you´ll see that Iran always was ""having a nuclear bomb in 2-3 years""."
"Do you seriously believe thiscrap? Seriously? I would have thought after the whole ""wmd"" that most Americans would be sceptical of what the government tells you. Because in reality contrarty to what the Governments say or what the media reports. There is *no evidence* that Iran wants or is seeking Nuclear weapons. Not even the IAEA has proven that. The only evidence so far that we have and is concrete is the attacks and threats on Iran by the US and Israel that has leads to the deaths of scientists and cyberattacks. If this was any other country war would have been declared but it's not happening. It's a case of bullies picking on a weak country."

Are you suggesting that India is going to power it's self on crude oil?  Do you know how expensive that would be?  Crude oil only amounts to 1% of all electricity generated in the US for comparison. 
I also don't like fungible being presented as a magic attribute that makes supply irrelevant.
Isnt the issue refinery capacity and not production.  I thought the refineries were running almost all out.  So plenty of crude but only so much can be refined.  That's why barrel price dropped to around 80 but gas price was still over $3.00 in the US.  Dont know what the current price is now but I remember it hovering around 80 like a month ago.

"I don't think its a good idea that we are doing it, just pointing out that its what's going on."
"Not sure why you made that assumption, im just pointing out what our sanctions are doing under the pretext of stopping iran from launching nuclear bombs."
They're facing massive pressure from the UN because Iran has resisted the IAEA's attempt for an investigation. and partially because of their ties to Hezbollah
"But a nuclear armed Iran would be against Russia's national interest.

Russia has already said this.
So why can't Iran pull out as well?
Surely though it makes little sense for the USA to break the rules to punish Iran for breaking rules. That's very blatant hypocrisy.

well good thing the US has been so proactive or they would have had bombs 20 years ago. Right?

"Ah, good point.

"When there are more blackouts, the generators will be used more which will require more oil imports.  

I wouldn't go as far as claiming this will have a major impact however.

"It doesn't make the supply irrelevant, it just means the original supply reaches the market through different means. Namely, it's sold at a huge discount by Iran (bad for Iran) and resold at the spot price for oil by other parties.

The sanctions do not reduce the supply of oil (if anything they increase it, explained in my other comment), they just affect what price Iran can get for their oil exports.

edit: typo"
"> I thought the refineries were running almost all out.

Who told you this?  They are lying.  Refiners are going bankrupt because the Naphtha market is taking a heavy hit now that Natural gas is so cheap.

Natural gas can be used to make petrochemical products like plastics cheaper than the old way (using naphtha).  The glut of nat gas esp in the US means that Chinese petrochemical manufacturing is hurting, lessening demand for Naphtha.

With a lower demand for Naphtha, price drops.  Since Naphtha constitutes around 40% of a barrel of crude after the crack, the other cracks go up in price to counter the drop in naphtha.

That's why you're seeing a rise in gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, resids and asphalt even though crude prices are dropping."
"How do you feel about Iranian terror operations?  Let me guess, they are Zionist false flag operations right?"
nukes are more than just a pretext. if the US needed a pretext they could have focused on irans human rights violations.
"Hezbollah is only considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Bahrain, the Netherlands, Canada, Egypt and Israel, while in Australia and the United Kingdom only Hezbollah's External Security Organization (Separate armed wing) is considered a terrorist organization. The Lebanese government considers Hezbollah to be an official 'resistance movement' and as such does not view the Taif Agreement requiring the dismantling of 'militias' to be applicable."
Really? I know that India said something similar; they said the fallout would cause massive damage to India and would be treated as an act of war (they referred to it as a genocide).
"> So why can't Iran pull out as well?

Because by doing so, they would lose international assistance with regards to their legit nuclear power program. This includes technology, manufacturing, engineering and resources (quality fuel). 

They should pull out if you ask me. "
"That would remove all doubt regarding Iran's intentions toward developing or obtaining nuclear weapons.  [Iran finds loopholes within the agreement to push the envelope](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/world/middleeast/iran-wont-halt-production-of-higher-grade-uranium.html) and [consistently plays the victim](http://www.jpost.com/IranianThreat/News/Article.aspx?id=279629), while at the same time they act [erratic](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11927720) and [suspicious](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/02/201222202920481596.html).

Basically, the regime relies on spin in order to maintain their hold over their own population.  The people of Iran are very proud of their nuclear program, and many are convinced it is only for peaceful purposes.

">If I understand something wrong, please enlighten me why diesel is independent from the crude oil market

Again, Crude oil and Diesel are seperate commodities.

Please read this;

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_(chemistry)

Diesel comes from crude oil, they are not the same product, and they are not directly related in prices or use.

I work as a mid-distillate petroleum product trader.  If diesel prices and crude oil prices matched perfectly as you claim - I wouldn't have a job.

I'm not entirely sure why you are pretending to know so much about the oil industry when you obviously know nothing - but are you honestly interested in learning?

If you are, say so and i'll attempt to explain how the oil industry works.  If not, i'm not going to waste my time.

>China and India are Iran's biggest crude clients

AGAIN. China and India buy crude - not 'iranian crude'.  If Iran was destroyed tomorrow by an asteroid, China and India would buy crude elsewhere.

That's what 'fungible' means as I told you back in the first comment.

>fun·gi·ble   [fuhn-juh-buhl]  Show IPA
adjective Law .
(especially of goods) being of such nature or kind as to be freely exchangeable or replaceable, in whole or in part, for another of like nature or kind.

Do you comprehend what Fungible means?  It means that 'Iranian' in Iranian Crude means bupkiss.  Crude oil is essentially a fungible commodity.  Iran competes on an international market.  If Iranian supply to India is reduced, India will buy other sources of crude on the spot market.

>how India can produce more diesel without importing more crude oil.

India can buy any crude to make diesel.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS SIMPLE CONCEPT?

"
Which election?
"> India can buy any crude to make diesel. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS SIMPLE CONCEPT?

No need to shout. We are having a discussion and not everyone can be proficient in any subject. 

Of course India can buy the crude anywhere, I get this. But if Iran is out, other sources will have to produce more oil to compensate those who were buying Iranian oil before. The question is whether Saudi Arabia can raise its oil production so easily to supply these countries, and if they can do that for a longer time stretch. I guess no one really knows that."
US Presidential.
"> But if Iran is out, other sources will have to produce more oil to compensate those who were buying Iranian oil before. 

Libya and Iraq have already compensated.  Add to that that the EU and China are facing troubling demand, why do you fear a price spike when crude futures are down?

>The question is whether Saudi Arabia can raise its oil production so easily to supply these countries

Why do you keep pretending Saudi Arabia is the only other producer of oil in the world? 

You are an arrogant little imbecile.  Stop pretending you are an expert in a subject about which you know nothing. "
"How about you stopping to insult people?  

I've never said I'm an expert. I even suggested that I'm not proficient in the subject. But I'm eager to learn. 
In my understanding, Saudi-Arabia is about the only country that can easily scale production up and down at will. Maybe that's wrong.  

You're right, both Iraq and Libya have been producing more over the last couple of the months.  
But there was no big dent in Iran's production yet, so we'll see how things turn out if there is a real effect of the embargos.  
That the world economy is not very strong at the moment makes for some headroom as well, I guess."

"Oil prices move 2.7% over the weekend all the time.  Oil prices did drop quite a bit immediately after the Iran deal was announced.  Some people probably thought that the deal could still fall apart before Iran actually started exporting oil.  

I haven't follow too closely, but I think that Iran is ready to export more oil right away than many people were expecting.  Also, the US dollar could have easily moved over the weekend and pushed the price up.  People often look for geo-political explanations for oil price changes when the real reasons are often nerdy and technical.  It can be as stupid as it's the end of the fiscal quarter and a bunch of contracts are closing.  "
That is because the market is just millions and billions of individual decisions happening at any given moment.
Well there was a major terrorist attack last time that began the long price climb so...
"Rapidly increasing oil consumption, and expected future demand, in the Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and most especially China).  At the same time, the discovery rate of new production wells was falling badly.  All of the easy to reach oil was pretty much gone.  

Then the market worked a lot like how they teach you in Econ 101.  The high prices made it cost effective to get oil from more difficult places- namely deep water and tar sands.  Fracking and oil shale technologies have allowed US oil production to increase by over 80% since 2005 to now equal Saudi Arabia (remember how hippie environmentalist Obama was going to destroy the oil industry?).  

Shortly after all of this expensive new technology was finally able to produce as much oil as the market was demanding, China's unstoppable economic growth showed signs of slowing down and Greece was throwing the Euro into turmoil.  That has caused the US dollar to get much stronger, which also makes the official oil price go up.  "

"Also, renewables are expanding at an amazing rate and they will only continue to expand as they get cheaper and cheaper. 

This is bad for the price of oil because the current price was based on the assumption that petroleum energy would spike upwards as more of the world develops. Oil demand WILL continue to increase, but renewables are flattening out the curve while more oil than necessary continues to enter the market. "
Iran is fucking adorable.

"These sanctions sound bad, and war sounds even worse. It's been made clear by Iran's leaders that they are not willing to negotiate. What I don't get (and by all means if anyone can explain this to me, it is welcome), is why we can't just be neutral like the Swiss? We could continue to allow some economic ties with Iran so their poorest aren't forced to starve and we stop being World Police. I don't understand why we can't severe ties with Isreal. Our alliance with them is only going to lead us into trouble. 

I understand that the US is powerful and influential and with great power comes great responsiblity, etc. But when the fuck is all this drama going to end? We are dealing with a region that is steeped in irrational religion-based terrorism. You can't talk people out of that shit. I don't understand why the more stable nations in the middle east can't take responsibility for their region. I think the middle east is simply a perpetual money-pit for America and I do not see what we as a nation are getting out of our involvement there.

Right on. These sanctions are hurting us ordinary citizens the most. Even pharmaceuticals which are exempt from the sanctions are not being sold to us. This is because sanctions on the financial system renders opening a line of credit for Iran virtually impossible irrespective of where this is done. Also pharma companies are reluctant to sell their drugs because of all the intricacies and obstacles posed by the sanctions. [The UN Secretary General expressed this as a humanitarian concern in the General Assembly a couple of days ago.](http://www.brecorder.com/world/middle-east/84006-un-chief-says-sanctions-on-iran-affecting-its-people-.html)

You put Israel above the United States. This should be treason.
"People are angry about this because Clinton's sanctions on Iraq killed over 500,000 Iraqi children while only serving to strengthen Saddam's control over the country.

Generally, people who support sanctions think ""Hey, at least they're better than sending our troops to war!""  However, this ""restraint"" that you're trying to give Obama for is the result of him being too subservient to Israel to actually engage with Iran diplomatically.

This ""restraint"" is inevitably going to result in the deaths of the poorest Iranians as a result of the actions of the regime.  The Green movement in Iran opposes these sanctions because they're ultimately going to benefit the ruling mullahs as they work to turn the population even further against the U.S. and their poverty-inducing sanctions.  

As a result, an entire generation of Iranians will grow up hating America, and it won't be because of our freedom... "
">do whatever it takes to stop middle east nuclear proliferation, obama. im with ya

Wouldn't a reasonable first step in this process be to pressure Israel to sign the NPT?"
"Israel isn't run by a religious fundi. But yeah we don't, except that iran's leader says they do not want them, and iran's religious leader even called a fatwa on nukes but meanwhile turkey is suddenly building tons of nuclear reactors and saudi arabia is publicly saying they sort of want nukes, so perhaps the net of attention should be thrown a bit wider to the great many of such nations.

"Don't worry, Obama won't start the war until after the election. Besides, we have a lot of soldiers from Iraq with nothing to do. It will save a lot of money to send them via bus to Iraq, rather than having to fly them back to the US. Deficit reduction!"
That isn't something Saudi's can do for a long time. This also means they are selling more for less and hurting themselves. In the long run those dictators are going to run away with all that money to some western nation.
Let's hope your hope is validated.
lolrks8s_2 is actually an Israeli. Check his history out. 
"No, I'd much rather that we try to engage with Iran diplomatically/economically instead of through force.  Even if Iran has nuclear weapons ambitions, they would only be seeking nukes because of the 100+ nukes that Israel has.  Either Israel completely disarms (or at least signs the NPT), or it should have to live surrounded by the nuclear arms race that it itself created.  I am a firm believer in M.A.D., and the Cold War shows us that the theory holds true.

That said, I believe that the Iranian regime is rational (a sentiment echoed by the formed head of Mossad) and would never drop a nuclear weapon on Israel (which is home to 1.5+ million Muslims).  They fully understand that doing so would result in the complete destruction of their entire country & population.  Iran would theoretically only want a nuke to act as a deterrent so that the West can't use its leverage to turn it into the next Afghanistan/Iraq/Libya/Yemen/Somalia/Syria...  

Notice how Pakistan has nukes (and plenty of terrorists), and yet they receive billions of dollars in foreign aid from the U.S. every year...  Perhaps the presence of nukes forces the West to actually engage with a country diplomatically instead of simply pushing for regime change whenever it suits its economic/geopolitical interests?"

You're probably referring to the misleading translation that ""Israel should be wiped off the map"", which only meant that Israel is an illegal entity and shouldn't continue to exist as it does.  Not that it should be blown to oblivion.  Iran is encircled by enemies, and any aggression you can point out is in reality self preservation.  If we stopped poking Iran with a stick all the time they wouldn't be so defensive.  Who can really blame them for seeking nuclear weapons?  Its the only way to get respect on the international stage.  There's no rational reason they'd actually use the weapons.  They just want to secure their own sovereignty.

Unlike you I dont just watch TV, I personally have spoken to Persians and Iranians while abroad. The people themselves despise their government but will admit Iran is incredibly hostile and is hated by all their neighbors for a reason, the government has horrible foreign policy and will readily threaten and act overtly aggressive toward anyone they want. You say it was a mistranslation but ask any Persian and they will tell you their president is a fucking mad man. 

I actually feel bad for the Persian people more then anything but if sanctions are a means to pressure their government to cooperate and improve foreign relations then I much prefer that instead of military action. I actually hope the people overthrow the current fucks at the top because I haven't heard a Persian person have one good thing to say about any of them.

Oh and way for you guys to pretend that its only America and Israel, the EU and Canada support these sanctions for much the same reasons. You guys can try to armchair diplomat this all you want but you are misinformed to call Iran peaceful and not take it into consideration the legitimacy of concerns that countries all around the world have about Irans irrational leadership.

"I think along a similar lines for most of what you said. But the problem with your argument is you are over-generalizing it. For example: ""Both sides think the government should be in control of who gets to marry who."". Yes, they both do, so they aren't believers in State rights over  Federal. But where do possibly differ is stance on who can marry who. So that in itself is a difference. Another difference may be beliefs on the pro-life/pro-choice debate.

Now do these social differences matter in the long run in terms of civil liberties? Not really. They're minor social issues. But they are differences nonetheless. And people tend not to care about the civil liberty issues sadly. They care much more about the social ones since that one has a perceived direct effect against them. "
The CIA has been pushing for regime change in Iran since 1979.  Of course they have a motive for trying to distort Iran's nuclear program.
"Yes obviously,  and it was directed at netanyanu and his, to many silly, bomb and attempt to get a war going with US involvement.

Frankly I think he was not far off about the simplemindedness of people and them needing such visual cartoon aids to make your point, so I'm not sure how silly it really was."

MEK. 

Jundullah.

Oppressing Palestine.

Honestly, what's the point of being a partisan hack?

http://damascus.usembassy.gov/sanctions-syr.html 


Also take note that Iran is actively supporting Syria in its effort to ""kill hundreds of thousands of its own people"" yes guys Iran is such a peaceful country

*Downvotes without counter points or just for disagreeing? You're whats wrong with reddit"
"As I said, all of that ""aggression"" is simply retaliatory.  If we stopped poking them with a stick they wouldn't be driven to that sort of thing.  

Also, I don't even *own* a tv [sniffs own fart]"
"But not to say that Iran *isn't* developing them, which is what they're saying."
"No one is calling Israel peaceful but people here are directly misleading and and misinforming people saying Iran is peaceful, it's just plain not."
"Agreed.  In theory, I'd imagine it's much easier to fabricate news reports about protests/killings than it is to fabricate proof of uranium enrichment to weapons grade. "
Where did I say that?
"You called someone a partisan hack for pointing out that Iran wasn't peaceful and in response said Israel isn't peaceful, that is not the point of the discussion. Iran isn't peaceful and neither is Israel, it doesn't justify either position as correct."
"Read it again. He listed organizations that have Iran's support, so I listed organizations that have Israel's support. To show that both sides do it. 

Work on your comprehension."
"You unjustifiably called someone a partisan hack when they pointed out Iran's non-peaceful affiliations in a direct response to Iran being called ""completely peaceful for decades""

Israel had nothing to fucking do with it, you obviously need to work on your reading comprehension."
"lolrsk8s_2 is a partisan hack. On every forum that talks about Iran or Israel, or Iran and Israel, he mentions those groups without mentioning the other groups that Israel supports. Given that the US sanctions are implicitly linked to US support of Israel, Israel has everything to do with this. Especially since groups like MEK using violence accompanies the sanctions as a two-tiered assault on the nation of Iran. Completely relevant. "
"If you were referencing his other posts; I did not see them, I was merely addressing the fact that whatever we say about Israel, USA, Canada or Saudi Arabia etc... it still doesn't make Iran peaceful. I just get sick of people here up-voting the shit out of the idea that Iran are completely peaceful, there just not.

Interestingly enough Israel AND Iran have so many enemies due to bad foreign policy, pissing off every country near your border is just bad news."
I friggin DARE YOU to give us a reason to permanently close your big yapper there rouhani....ya jackoff. 
"Well, rouhani has a point in the sense, the US is just eroding beaurocratic trust if it changes stances of really big economic decisions like sanctions. Iran's entire economic plans for the year and what not would depend on the prescence or absence of sanctions. Even other countries like Asia and Europe's trading decisions depend on it.

US must find some other way to throw it's weight around and leash iran, if that's it's intent, atleast in short term. "
"Didn't this guy come to Reddit, before taking over, and trying to say why he would be so much better for Iran?"

But not Cuba? Why?
Just like he'd veto NDAA.
  Are you people crazy? When do you have enough wars? Now Obama should go to war because the American police view him as soft? How many people have to die to show how tough a president is? How many more trillions of dollars have to be taken from the people for wars. These wars have gutted the economy and increased hatred for America around the world. Stop it.
"I'm not so sure a Veto would be good for POTUS or his party. People in the US are starting to think he's soft on, well everything, terrorism, rogue states, South America, even on human rights issues like the Ugandan anti-gay laws. Should be interesting to watch this play out. I really hope Iran doesn't get the bomb. "
[deleted]
Touché
Did he actually ever say he'd veto that bill?
"I seem to remember it was Obama who tried to get us into a war with Syria, before the American people stopped him. We weren't so crazy then, eh?"
"We're all crazy but I can't find anyone in here calling for a war, just sanctions. "
"Actually for the country, and the world as a whole a veto is sort of needed. We wen't to negotiate with Iran, made promises in exchange for other promises. We should hold up our end of the bargain and see if they do the same. The two countries clearly do not trust each other and how things play out here will set the tone in the future. If we enact new sanctions now it blows the only real chance we've had in 40+ years at resolving our standing issues, and we might not get another moderate power in Iran for a very long time if this fails to yield results."
Thank God Putin convinced him to be soft on Assad!
Look who they let out of the cage again.
"He said he would, then when it got to his desk, he looked at the cameras and said ""I don't like parts of this bill"" as he signed on the line."
So the American people don't want a war now with Iran either. What's your point?
  Apparently Obama was not that committed to a Syrian war. he took the peace train.
"I think that it's not the people that stopped the war, but rather Kerry and his impromptu (probably ill thought out) comment in regards to ""what it would take to not go to war"".


Once he stated the specific theoretical conditions Russia and Syria acted quickly to deliver, meaning that going to war would look bad."
  Iran said doing sanctions again would scrap the new deals. That would put us back in the attack to stop them from getting the bomb mode.
"I completely agree. However, I'm not sure that the president has the necessary amount of political capital to follow that course of action. Nor do I think he and his party would be able to take the lambasting that it would most likely get in the media if they were to follow this course of action. That doesn't mean they won't use it just that it would probably look bad for them in an election year."
"Yeah, talk about a loss of influence in the region. "
[deleted]
"And if he didn't, there were bigger problems. This is why a line item veto is useful, and it should take 2/3rds of Congress to over turn each one of those line item vetoes. "
"...on New Year's Eve, when everyone was partying and nobody was paying attention.

Luckily though, he added a signing statement(which has no legal standing and means absolutely nothing) saying how much he didn't like parts of the bill"
Are we not now? Is there any proof they've stopped enriching?
"Not necessarily. Russia is concerned that due to this change of position with Iran/US, it will lose influence with Iran and that fact alone ought to make all the neocon boys & girls very happy."
"you're shit at trolling, delete your system32 folder"
"You've got it wrong. The terrorists are from Saudi Arabia, or Saudi Arabian colonies like Pakistan."
Yup. I'm Iranian and I love my country. You on the other hand were the most butthurt person on earth after the deal was reached with the West. Remember how you deleted all your posts and comments? That was amazing. Can't wait when the final deal comes through. I'd call the suicide hotline if I were you.
They're allowed to enrich under international law
"Part of the new deal was full access to their nuclear facilities, so we'll find out soon."
"  They allow international inspection on a daily basis. The Iranis do not want war. it is the Saudis, Israelis and right wing Americans who want it. Iran was pretty westernized by most standards before we decided a boycott was in their interests."
"Possiblly, but I'm still quite concerned with the growing presence of Chinese military vessels in the region. It's getting pretty crowded in the Arabian Gulf. "
"http://app.debka.com/p/article/23581/Iran-blatantly-defies-five-key-Geneva-Pact-commitments---heads-for-nuclear-arsenal     .....yeah, there's no final deal coming through Mr. I-love- Iran........probably just NATO and/or Israel physically disarming your scumbag government.....hey, you tried though..."
I thought they were only allowed to enrich to eight percent under international law. Not to twenty. 
Should be interesting to see how advanced their program is. 
"Trust me, most Americans are tired of war. And the Iranians were very westernized before the Ayatollahs took over yes. "
[Maddow from the 10' mark](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/12/20/maddow_political_games_on_iran_deal_risk_war.html)
I was waiting for you to come out of your cage again. How long will it take you to delete this comment and go cry again because Obama abandons you and gives us the Middle East?
"Sorry, I just can't take anything that comes from MSNBC seriously. And I can't see a way we can let them keep enriching and not spark a war the only question I have is would it start with the bombing of an enrichment facility or the atomic destruction of an Israeli city? "
"Don't be mad because I'm right and have been all along. The terrorists are not going to win this one. Their intentions are quite obvious. So, for Iran, they will get slapped with more sanctions, and probably have to be disarmed by the brave Israelis. I knew Iran's terrorist government was full of shit!! I knew it!! And don't you feel dumb for supporting them?? "
Which particular fact was it that Maddow introduces which causes you difficulty?
Do you really believe Iran would actually use its nukes? It would be national suicide. It wants nukes because nukes mean the US never invades you. It means Israel doesn't get to occasionally bomb you for the hell of it. 
Remind me again how many comments you've deleted out of butt hurt? The only place that you're right is Israeli right wing wet dream websites like Debka. Of course I don't blame you for being depressed. Reality is not going well for you and your herd.
"None of them. I was simply saying that I don't take the channel seriously. It's like the writing in Playboy, some very well constructed articles that are spoiled by their chosen delivery method. "
"No, but like you said, it's a huge and quite possibly economically destabilizing bit of leverage for a state with a remarkably bad track record when it comes to human rights, economic forthrightness and terrorism. "

She's very clever."
Plenty of people would say the same things about Israel. 
"Im sorry I cant hear you over the butt hurt. The entire international buisiness community is lining up to do buisiness with us, bitch. While the boycott your little freaks. See ya in 6 months, try not to get a heart attack. "

I didn't send a monkey, people from my country did. I notice your buddies in Israel haven't sent anything to space though, even after 80 years :D Maybe ask their bitches in Congress to give them one.

You proved me wrong when? Masturbating in a basement is not called proving someone wrong.

And the oil fields in the US and Canada.
How much is it per barrel?

bibie needs to focus on his own foreign relations which are horrible.
really wish Graham would just jump head first into a wood chipper
The US is Israel's bitch.
"""U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said in Jerusalem that the Senate will vote on an Iran sanctions bill next month.

Graham (R-S.C.), who is expected to take over as chairman of the Foreign Appropriations Subcommittee when the Republicans assume control of the Senate in January, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli capital on Saturday night.

Graham told Netanyahu that 'the Congress will follow your lead' and will want to have a say about any final deal."""
"Fuck Israel, and fuck this asswipe."
$tatus quo... no matter who you elect in this country nothing will change. 
"US should follows IAEA, EU, UN's lead. Israel will never want an equitable solution to this situation. America should never follow but lead. This is our Manifest Destiny. Politicians should be their voters' bitch, not Israel's bitch. "
Good. Iran will cooperate or face the consequences.
I'd watch the liveleak video.
"The real question is why? It's just another aggressive middle eastern country as far as I'm concerned. They don't have more money or resources than the Saudis, so why are we bound at the hip to Israel?"
"Definitely. A country of eight million controls the world's remaining superpower. 

The sheeple need to wake up"
"But there's no Israeli lobby in Washington.

And if you suggest it, then you're a Jew-hatin' Nazi !"
what have they done? 
"Forget liveleak, that shit should be on pay-per-view in HD."
"> Definitely. A country of eight million controls the world's remaining superpower.

And still some have the nerve to say that Israel isn't G-d's Chosen.

Go figure."
"There is an Israeli lobby. The problem is suggesting that it is some sort of Jewish conspiracy. In this country there is  freedom to lobby the government on behalf of a cause. As long as no laws are broken and the cause is just, why should there be any issues? 

Reference to the Jews controlling the world is an old anti-semitic belief dating back centuries. So yes, this whole insinuation us anti-semitic to a certain degree. "
Nice strawman
"Right?!

Just the other day, I was hanging with my ~~Zionist~~ Jewish friends, saying how awesome it is to be the Chosen People. "
"> In this country there is freedom to lobby the government on behalf of a cause.

Not so fast. A long time ago AIPAC was considered for registration as a Foreign Agent. There is [no freedom in the United States to lobby on behalf of foreign states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act). Anyone who does it without registration as a Foreign Agent is committing treason. This includes the [politicians who take kickbacks from Chinese industries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney) and are seethed at under every breath of the American working class.

The actual question is [which totally-not-a-conspiracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act#Selective_enforcement) has kept AIPAC and other elements of the Israeli lobby off the Foreign Agents list."

"How do you define a ""conspiracy""?"
"> How do you define a ""conspiracy""?

With a dictionary.

Examples -

http://www.timesofisrael.com/new-nsa-document-highlights-israeli-espionage-in-us/

http://www.newsweek.com/israel-wont-stop-spying-us-249757

Spying is a conspiracy, no? I mean I could be wrong but I don't think I am. If I am, I'd sure like to know so I can be right."
"No, I mean like the general definition. What is it to you?"
"As said - the [definition delivered by the dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conspiracy). 

My own (maybe poorly worded) definition - action taken by a group that takes actions to benefit the group, a need of the group, a target of the group. Some actions taken by the group would be taken in secret, at times the group itself is secret.

After reading the above, you may understand why I chose to reference the definition within the dictionary and to use what I believe are examples of conspiracies to show my understanding of the term rather than offer my words to explain my understanding of the term."
So how exactly is there a 'Jewish conspiracy' then? AIPAC and other Jewish lobbying groups are common knowledge.
"Your trail failed. A troll that was obvious in its repeated attempt to hook the great catch you believed you would finally reel in. Your response to me was -

> So how exactly is there a 'Jewish conspiracy' then? AIPAC and other Jewish lobbying groups are common knowledge.

Maybe out of excitement you felt as you sensed finally there was a nibble at your bait you failed to read the entire portion of my post that you responded to with the above quote. This next quote comes from that post by me - 

> Some actions taken by the group would be taken in secret, at times the group itself is secret.

Should I here ask - ""What is your definition of 'at times'?"" 

Should I here note while AIPAC and other Jewish lobbying groups are ""common knowledge"", which by no means of the proper definition (or my own understanding of the definition) of conspiracy does a group being known commonly exclude a group from being considered conspiratorial - if that's what the group is. Also, does this mean there are no Jewish groups not commonly known? Does this mean these not commonly known Jewish groups, if they exist, would not commit any conspiracies?

The attempt to troll as well as the argument you offer seem rather blunted as well as slightly insulting to those of insulted by poor arguments. Both the troll and argument appear as such not only in refusal to understand and read what others have written in order you can hurry to your excited climax but it appears too in the argument you attempted. That argument - 'because AIPAC and other groups are known AIPAC and other groups cannot conspire'. 

Do you truly wish to push this idea as an idea you believe to be valid or would you like some time in order to devise a new argument against the very real and non-arguable fact some Jewish groups, known or otherwise, do conspire.


**edit** reworded without changing substance, corrected grammar, fixed tone."
Do you think Jews are secretly plotting to take over the world?
"So now we've reverted to an even more simplistic and insulting argument? An argument which in the 2nd power, possibly 3rd, shows you've failed to read what has been provided to you.

Have a good night.

"Why the hell would Americans want to increase sanctions on Iran? Because the far right Likud believes they are a threat? America is in no way threatened by Iran. Let Israel fight its own battles. 

This really begs the question as to whose interests are being represented by these special action committees. Is the democratic process being manipulated by foreign government interests here?

The democratic process in the US is completely broken, the donations system is essentially cash for representation, and these lobby groups enable minority voices to get a larger share of representation than their numbers allow. 

The Republicans and Democrats really shouldn't be trusted to run your country if this is the democracy they have conspired to create. Fuck. Stop voting for them please, just vote someone else. Put your petty political differences aside please and get them out of all your institutions. They arent going to change if you give them life.

EDIT: And they are a 501C nonprofit despite:

Political activity

They risk loss of tax exempt status if these rules are violated.[35][36] An organization that loses its 501(c)(3) status due to being engaged in political activities cannot then qualify for 501(c)(4) status.[37]"
The Jews are a minority in the US. How can they have such lobbying power?

"First they wanted war with Syria and we raised enough of a stink to stop them. Now they want us to starve Persians and then push us into a war with them. Collective punishment is bad when its against Israel, but the greatest thing ever when its against Persians.

EDIT:
Since this is supposedly about the Iranian Nuclear Threat let's talk about something much more real: The Israeli Nuclear Threat. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War Israel threatened the US,  ""give us weapons or we'll nuke Egypt and Syria"". So its been for the past 41 years.

Say what you want about the US, they absolutely don't want nuclear weapons being used against nations. The Israeli Nuclear Threat is ongoing, year after year it hangs over the US policy towards Israel. The US **must** provide Israel with billions worth of weapons to give it a Qualitative Military Edge or Israel will have nuclear weapons detonating all over the ME.

What Israel is doing is no different then Kim Jong Il/Un. Give us supplies or we'll end up nuking these guys. Mad Dog Israel is a greater nuclear threat than either Iran, Pakistan, or North Korea and they're holding the world hostage."

Combined with the fact that AIPAC has had a several decade head-start over Arab/Muslim groups, it is not surprising that US foreign policy vis-a-vis Israel-Palestine is heavily slanted toward Israel."

"*Here's the linked section [Aid to Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War#Aid to Israel) from Wikipedia article [Yom Kippur War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War)* : 

---

>Based on intelligence estimates at the commencement of hostilities, American leaders expected the tide of the war to quickly shift in Israel's favor, and that Arab armies would be completely defeated within 72 to 96 hours. On October 6, Secretary of State Kissinger convened the National Security Council's official crisis management group, the Washington Special Actions Group, which debated whether the U.S. should supply additional arms to Israel. High-ranking representatives of the Defense and State Departments opposed such a move. Kissinger was the sole dissenter; he said that if the U.S. refused aid, Israel would have little incentive to conform to American views in postwar diplomacy. Kissinger argued the sending of U.S. aid might cause Israel to moderate its territorial claims, but this thesis raised a protracted debate whether U.S. aid was likely to make it more accommodating or more intransigent toward the Arab world.

>

>.

>By October 8, Israel had encountered military difficulties on both fronts. In the Sinai, Israeli efforts to break through Egyptian lines with armor had been thwarted, and while Israel had contained and begun to turn back the Syrian advance, Syrian forces were still overlooking the Jordan River and their air defense systems were inflicting a high toll on Israeli planes. It became clear by October 9 that no quick reversal in Israel's favor would occur and that IDF losses were unexpectedly high.

>During the night of October 8–9, an alarmed Dayan told Meir that ""this is the end of the third temple."" He was warning of Israel's impending total defeat, but ""Temple"" was also the code word for nuclear weapons. Dayan again raised the nuclear topic in a cabinet meeting, warning that the country was approaching a point of ""last resort"". That night Meir authorized the assembly of thirteen 20-kiloton-of-TNT (84 TJ) tactical atomic weapons for Jericho missiles at Sdot Micha Airbase, and F-4 aircraft at Tel Nof Airbase, for use against Syrian and Egyptian targets. They would be used if absolutely necessary to prevent total defeat, but the preparation was done in an easily detectable way, likely as a signal to the United States. Kissinger learned of the nuclear alert on the morning of October 9. That day, President Nixon ordered the commencement of Operation Nickel Grass, an American airlift to replace all of Israel's material losses. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Kissinger told Sadat that the reason for the U.S. airlift was that the Israelis were close to ""going nuclear"". European countries refused to allow U.S. airplanes carrying supplies for Israel to refuel at their bases, fearing an Arab oil embargo, with the exception of Portugal and the Netherlands. Portugal permitted the United States to use a leased base in Azores, and the defence minister of the Netherlands, apparently acting without consulting his cabinet colleagues, secretly authorised the use of Dutch airfields.

>

>Israel began receiving supplies via U.S. Air Force cargo airplanes on October 14, although some equipment had arrived on planes from Israel's national airline El Al before this date. By that time, the IDF had advanced deep into Syria and was mounting a largely successful invasion of the Egyptian mainland from the Sinai, but had taken severe material losses. According to Abraham Rabinovich, ""while the American airlift of supplies did not immediately replace Israel's losses in equipment, it did allow Israel to expend what it did have more freely"".  ...

>Newly declassified documents reveal that Israel nearly made use of its nuclear weapons during the fateful opening days of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Israel’s Yediot Ahronot reported on Thursday.

I would get you the declassified documents but I don't speak the 'brew."
"Yeah we can cherry-pick articles that suits our agendas.

- [AIPAC, Defense Contractors Promise to Go ‘All-Out’ Pushing Syria War](http://news.antiwar.com/2013/09/06/aipac-defense-contractors-promise-to-go-all-out-pushing-syria-war/)

The next myth is that the AIPAC isn't [lobbying](http://www.lobelog.com/47-senators-take-aipacs-word-over-u-s-intel-community/) for war with Iran."
"I looked at the sourcing in Wikipedia, which is a paper by Farr (published in FAS), which sources Hersh's book for all of its claims about nuclear threats during the Yom Kippur war.  

The source from Yediot Ahronot, which you can find in English [here](http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/24157/Default.aspx) notes that this was Dayan's suggestion and continues with:  After brief consideration, Meir rejected the proposal, and Israel went on the win the war by conventional means."
Hello sir I am from AIPAC and I've never even heard of this Iran you speak of.
"No, no. this isn't how it works. If you want to disprove my argument, that AIPAC **joined** Obama's call for action in Syria rather than instigating it, you need to provide a reliable source which shows AIPAC pushing for a military action in Syria BEFORE president Obama called for it.

Obama played a dirty trick here as he did a 180 in just one week leaving AIPAC lobbying for him and taking all the blame, while he got off scot-free."
"Sure, I failed to address your first article, but the AIPAC simply publicly lobbied for a U.S. strike on Syria, in support of Obama's resolution. Your article suggests that the [Israeli](http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-intelligence-seen-as-central-to-us-case-against-syria/) lobby was not [pushing](http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/09/13/the-people-against-the-800-pound-gorilla/) for war on Syria prior to Obama's resolution."
"Considering that achieving a deal with Iran over this would have such wide consequences for the region and will remain historically significant for decades to come, I think patience is of the utmost need at this time.

We live in a fast moving world, but issues of this magnitude cannot be resolved quickly. I would rather see nuclear peace in the region (including Israel, Pakistan, and India) than have a war to dispose of these weapons forcefully. Because that would breed anti-Western hostility.

Congress won't be acting in the long-term of interests of the world. The diplomacy the White House is engaging is far more crucial at this point. It is the White House warming ties with Cuba, not Congress. The White House is the biggest factor in foriegn policy these days. Congress is here to oppose any move made by the opposite party, and focus on domestic issues by blocking most opposing bills.
"
"Negotiations have played out though...the deadline passed last November and Iran was not even held accountable. What good is setting a deadline if Iran is never held accountable and they just keep buying time trying to secretley,quickly build a weapon? Everyone knows they are trying. I actually think Israel could take action eventually because the rest of the world doesn't resolve the matter."
"Bring it!

Then we pass'em anyway with an override."
"When did Iran stopped being the Enemy? Its not like they stopped enriching, or downsized their ambitions for nuclear power. What changed? Did we just suddenly became less dick?"
Is Obama aware how much Iran hates America? They're on par with NK with hating America except stronger. They advertise 9/11. Sounds like Obama is losing a game of chicken right now.
"Don't forget these right wing republicans have to repay there sponsors, who are??? Yep military contractors! And what do they want? Yep, war! I think they call that fait accompli don't they?"
"If Republicans get the White House in 2016, war with Iran is 100% guaranteed."
"oh bullshit. Negotiating with the regime is not substantially different than negotiating with their trading partners, the North Koreans. Best bet is to destabilize their national government, assasinate the mullahs, and let Iran revert to the democracy it's been for much of the last half a century. "
Israel should take action. There hasn't been consequence to state on state action in a while. 
"> Its not like they stopped enriching

[You're right] (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/20/iran-halt-enrichment-uranium-iaea-confirms-eu-sanctions)

Nor should they as they have a sovereign right to have as much nuclear produced power as they wish. Or at least should. Hell, they should have the right to build nukes all they want without consequence as well."

"Exactly. The famous [""Death to America""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_to_America) phrase originates in Iran, and is actually repeated constantly at various government celebrations and rallies at that country."

"Your dad is a citizen, the government is responsible for the citizens. You can thank the Iranian government for being so hostile for the sanctions. I'm sure it's mostly the older conservative Iranians that really hate America but it doesn't matter because the government is the ones with power."
Iranian people are very different from the Iranian government. Most Iranians I've met have been full-on atheists. Too bad they can't do much about it :(
And yet people will continue to defend Iran and criticize America for the well deserved sanctions.
I doubt she's gonna run. I think it seems pretty clear a republican is gonna win next election and Hillary won't spoil her chance with an election against the odds but you never know 
What the hell makes you think a Republican is going to win? Have you not noticed every piece of data suggesting otherwise?
2/3 of the government right noW. Americans voters usually vote the opposite party that has been in power for the past 8 years. Obama hasn't been a breakthrough president that will make voters vote democrat again in my opinion and to be honest the republicans winning the midterm elections is probably not what reddit expected but it was what should be expected.
"The Republicans winning the midterms was predicted by absolutely everyone. The only people not expecting it weren't paying attention to the facts.

But these were elections that the Democrats were fighting uphill to try to win. They were largely in regions that only flipped blue due to the original Obama bump in 08. Combine that with historically low turnout, and it was no surprise that the Republicans recovered ground.

The bad news for them is that 2016 is a Presidential election. That means higher turnout, which doesn't work in their favor. The Republicans will also have 24 seats up for reelection in the Senate while the Dems have 10. "
"But... isn't the executive attempting to scrap the deal as ""no good"" and increase sanctions?

When did common sense intervene?"
"*""Human Rights?""* LOL!!!!

We talking about Iran after all.. who's Supreme Leader goes on Twitter rants where he calls women's rights a ""Zionist conspiracy."" /nuff said."
One of the few good things he's done in office regarding foreign policy.
"As he should. 

Iran is in complete compliance with the stipulations set aside in [Joint Plan of Action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_interim_agreement_on_Iranian_nuclear_program). They've shown no signs of deception, and they've agreed to allow the IAEA to inspect their facilities any time they request.

Congress is currently acting on the will of [AIPAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee), the Israeli interest lobbiest group in DC. Israel has a hard on for crippling economic sanctions on Iran, so AIPAC lobbies exactly for this. Congress members don't want to lose campaign donations from AIPAC, or be called ""Anti-Israel"" and lose votes, so they're willing to cripple a foreign country's economy back to the stone age.

If Iran violated the Joint Plan of Action, by all means, cripple their economy, but why would you vote to do so, when they've done no such thing, and you promised **NOT** to place sanctions on them for 6 months from the 24th of November 2013? That's only going to make them want to create nuclear weapons. If you comply 100% with someone not to create weapons and allow them to see everything you're doing, and they're still destroying your country, why would you **NOT** create weapons to hurt them in the process? Congress is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy with these sanctions."
Thanks Obama! Stay on course!

"> get chemical weapons out of Syria.

I think Russia has a lot more to do with that than us.  Prior to their involvement, it seems much more like we were going to give additional aid to the rebels and perhaps strike the Assad government -- which in retrospect would have been incredibly harmful as it would be largely to the benefit of the foreign Sunni militants who are now also spilling into Iraq.

"
"""He isn't doing that bad"" for a US president."
"Lel year rite
"
"Kinda hard to not kick hornet nests when you're surrounded by them.

Not to defend many of Israel policies, as they are rightfully fucked up, but you have to keep in mind they're in a fucked up place with fucked up people, on both sides of the equation. 

And let's not forget that Israel stood by itself for around three decades before the United States started giving support, during that time it was invaded, and itself invaded, all it's neighbors, many of whom saw Israel as having no right to exist, and Israel itself seeing them as a fundamental danger to their very existence and stability. 

Is it fucked up what Israel is doing? Yes. Is it fucked up what Hamas in Gaza and Hellzbollah in Lebanon are doing, namely firing rockets into Israel? Yes. Is there any one person to blame? No. Does everybody share a substantial amount of blame? Yes. 

But that aside, looking a realpolitik view, Israel is one of the most advanced, most professional and most efficient military forces not only in the region, but *in the world.* They are also probably the one nation in the Middle East whom has the most in common with us, economically, politically and militarily. So, I do have to say you're wrong in us severing all ties, as we are natural allies, and not only that, Israel is a *valuable* ally. "
both Israel and Iran need to stop this warmongering of theirs
"Oh, The US Intelligence Community! Excuse me while I smooth out the goose bumps."
"Yeah, in fact, [I do](http://i.imgur.com/Vh7wpxX.jpg)."
"I disagree. Russia played a vital part, without a doubt, but they were not the ones who got the deal on the table. 

The threat of U.S. military action did. 

Russia helped ease the passage and get the wheels turning, their value in that regard can not be understated, but the majority of the reason it even got that far in the first place was because of the United States' hard power an apparent willingness to use it. "
Well you can't say they don't know have the resources or the ability to find out this shit. ;)
I too can post pictures of people in hospital beds. 
"I disagree in that I think Syria with chemical weapons and Assad would be less worse than Syria with or without chemical weapons and without Assad, given the power of the Sunni militants relative to the Western-backed rebels."
Grabbing one of their nipples?
"Yes, but the thing is through clever diplomatic maneuvering we got both, a Syria with Assad and without chemical weapons.

Both of which were only possible because of the U.S.'s willingness to use military force, but at the same time it's willingness to compromise. Even if what Kerry said was a genuine mistake, Obama managed to influence it into his favor *(which, in my personal opinion, is even more impressive)*, which is why I think his foreign policy has been, generally, well-rounded and capable of adapting to changing circumstances."
"If that's what you're into, I can probably arrange it. "
"You're assuming Obama wanted this outcome. Russia and Syria played them, and called their bluff."
Umayyad bro?
"It doesn't matter what Obama wanted, what matters is what he got. Which was rather good in my opinion, the removal of chemical weapons to satisfy the *""Red Line""* so as to save face, plus you know...the whole less chemical weapons in the Middle East thing...which is pretty god damn admirable. 

Russia and Syria didn't call our bluff. Calling our bluff would've been saying *""Fuck you attack us""* and than us not attacking. We were positioned to strike, Syria saw that and Syria believed that, which is why Syria scrambled to find a compromise to hold off the dogs of war and Russia scrambled to smooth things over an' ease the transition. Obama was willing to compromise, and he did. "
"Why would that make me mad? 

US intel says Iran is developing plutonium 239

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium#Applications"
"Actually, no, the bluff was the idea that scrapping the weapons would prevent an attack. Kerry **never** intended for that offer to be taken up, and Obama **definitely** was spoiling for a fight. That was **not** a serious offer, but mere propaganda.

The Russians and the Syrians jumped at the opportunity and called the bluff, embarrassing Kerry and Obama, and forcing a climb down. The US had no choice but to accept, though for a moment it looked like they were going to refuse even if Syria disarmed its chemical weapons, but that would have made it look incredibly stupid."
Because Sharon was grabbing his nipple.
"Which goes to my point, one of Obama's strengths is the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. 

Not only did he avoid a war, he got chemical weapons out of Syria, *because* he was willing to adapt and compromise. 

And those chemical weapons would've never been removed if it wasn't for the threat of U.S. hard power, or the apparent willingness to use it, as I mentioned before."
"Why does that matter? What does he have to do with this discussion? Why are you distracting from the conversation and making comments about a man's nipple instead of the discussion at hand? 

I mean, dude, there's absolutely *NOTHING* wrong with homosexuality or homoeroticism. But this is neither the time or the place. I'd be just as wrong if I was posting pictures of girls playing with their nipples, because like I said, this is neither the time nor the place. :)"

> WASHINGTON - US lawmakers on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved bipartisan bills to crack down on supporters of Syrian President Bashar Assad&#039;s government and renew a decades-old Iran sanctions law.

> The Syria legislation targets key backers of Assad such as Russia and Iran, according to Royce, by requiring the president to sanction countries or companies that do business with or provide financing to the Syrian government or the Central Bank of Syria.

> Secretary of State John Kerry last month called for a war crimes investigation of Russia and Syria, a move that escalated already heated rhetoric against Moscow for its part in a deadly military offensive in Aleppo, Syria&#039;s largest city, and its longstanding support of Assad. The Syria legislation, formally titled the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, is named after a crime scene photographer for the Syrian military who was reassigned to photograph the bodies of imprisoned Syrian rebels and dissidents after the conflict began.

That needs some evidence. Apparently we had to go into Iraq after 10+ years of sanctions didn't achieve whatever outcome we were looking for. Decades of sanctions on Cuba didn't do much of anything. North Korea is still making and blowing up nuclear weapons despite sanctions. Russian hasn't given Crimea back.

"How are they this alarmed? They've known it was coming for months, they knew what Iran would gain access to and what it wouldn't. You would think the Saudis would have had enough time to plan..."
Maybe the one that doesn't cut heads like it's a game.
"It's really strange Obama's stance on this one. I just read on Folha de São Paulo, a brazilian newspaper, that Obama personally cleared space for the brazilian efforts, stating that accepting the swap deal was ""Iran's Last Chance"" to avoid sanctions and Lula had his approval for a diplomatic approach. As soon as Lula began to travel to Russia, Obama himself spoke with Medvedev, and the same with Qatar premier, the next step in his travel. The brazilian embassy noticed an ""exceptional"" effort from US for the swap deal to fail. Americans tried to play with brazilian diplomacy and it apparently backfired, and now Obama is giving to China and Russia unprecedented political and military bargains to agree with sanctions against Iran in the UN Security Council. It sounds a very dirty game that Obama is playing here. "
"What is Brazil doing in all of this? I just don't understand why they have suddenly shown up as a big name in the Iran deal.

I get Turkey, America, China, Russia, the Arab world, Israel, etc. all having a say but Brazil's presence confuses me."
"I think going forward with the sanctions is so idiotic. Rejection diplomatic deals however small and constantly walking out of the UN when Ahmadinejad is speaking is just completely childish.

Iran is maybe counting on this happening so they can say they tried. So call their bluff and see if it actually works out. This all or nothing kind of thing isn't sellable to the Iranians."
"A major problem with the 10-point deal reached between Brazil, Turkey and Iran on an exchange of enriched uranium is that the context within which it was concluded has little to do with nuclear nonproliferation and the international community's interest to halt Iran's advance toward a military nuclear capability. It has everything to do with economics and political posturing. Rather than serving as a mediator between the West and Iran on the nuclear issue – the stated goal of Brazil and Turkey in their efforts – the resulting document suggests that the two states have acted more as Iran's representatives in resisting pressure from the P5+1. 

The basic motivation for the deal was to take the wind out of an impending P5+1 decision on a fourth round of sanctions against Iran for its ongoing unwillingness to engage on the nuclear issue. This was the primary common interest that linked the three states; Brazil and Turkey both have economic ties with Iran that they would like to maintain and enhance. "
"Thanks for your opinion, Iranian state-run media. I will wait to hear some Israeli propaganda before I make up my mind."
I really have no problem with the sanctions most of the industries it targets does not effect the civilians. Mostly it it just further restrictions on weapon technology they can buy or try and develop. It also shuts down bank accounts that are run by the revolutionary guard. From what I have read this will have little effect on the common Iranian unless they work at a missile factory or for the accounting office in the Revolutionary Guard. 
"et tu, Brazil?"
I'm sure they will forge ahead with sanctions since they have a proven track record in Iraq. The [death of a few hundred thousand civilians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_sanctions#Effect_of_the_sanctions_on_the_Iraqi_people) doesn't really count if you don't use a bomb. Besides think of all the lives they saved by avoiding having to go to war with Saddam!
[deleted]
"It may be pertinent that at the time this plan was decided upon, by carrying it out Iran would have handed over so much enriched uranium that it would not have had enough left to fashion a bomb. 

Due to the amount of time that has passed (the centrifuges are still spinning) that is no longer true. The transfer of 1,200Kg (if memory serves) now has no effect on Iran's ability to enrich a sufficient quantity to weapons-grade level and fashion a bomb."
"It's all driven by israel. Obama is just doing their bidding.

Yeah Iran has acted mature and reasonable.
"Iran lost support from China and Russia, now they forced to seek help from their 2nd tier allies.

Obama is winning the diplomacy battle.  Last year it would have been laughable to assume China and Russia would sign on to any sanctions at all.  Now look....

Brazil and Turkey don't have the economic clout to fight Russia and China on this - the Sanctions will pass.

"Just 8 months of difference? I guess not, it takes much more to create the bomb with 99% 235 isotopes from the 3,5% they have now after years of enrichment.

"> Just 8 months of difference? I guess not, it takes much more to create the bomb with 99% 235 isotopes from the 3,5% they have now after years of enrichment. 

You can read the [report here](http://the-diplomat.com/2010/05/18/what-the-iran-deal-is-missing/). Iran has 2065Kg of LEU according to the last IAEA report , up from 1,763 Kg. The 1,200 Kg transfer would have left a large, but not large enough, amount in Iran. That transfer is now no longer large enough as they're still producing 3Kg/day."
"You only need 70-80% to give the bomb a chance of working and 90% to give it a very good chance of working.  US nukes are all in the high 90's, so we know they'll work.  All the hot and bother of Iran going to 20% is just absurd.  20% Uranium really is used to make medical isotopes, and Iran really has a test reactor capable of making such isotopes.  Iran is also actually running out of their stock of isotopes and has cancer patients who aren't getting treated.  "

"Yes, but they don't have the technology to make the fuel rods for that reactor - so their explanation that they are making it for 'fuel for a research reactor' is utter bullshit."

"Well regardless - the sanctions aren't due to their stockpile, but due to their continued enrichment activities.

Don't conflate the two, that's what Iran want's you to do."
I didn't know that.  Know of anywhere on the inets where I could read more?  
So why aren't they agreeing to their treaty obligations?
"Yes, i'm sure it does.  Do you think it should be held accountable for violating those treaties?

If so, then why shouldn't Iran be held accountable for violating the treaties it signs?  Or are you trying to say that Iran should stoop to the level of America?"
">w can you call that irrelevant? Also, none of that is hyperbole - do you know what the word means?

Have you considered getting a basic education before you troll the internet?"
"Oh sorry, but FYI NY Daily news is like the Daily Fail - check out the comments.  It's like a lowbrow version of the NY Post - if such a thing exists. ;)

If you read the article again, no where does China say they remove support for sanctions, only that they also approve of the Brazil deal.  Beware of the spin!

The Brazil deal and sanctions are mutually exclusive."
"every country has the right to enrichment, Iran is also signed with the NTP, where India, Pakistan and North Korea have openly tested and declared that they possess nuclear weapons, while Israel has had a policy of opacity regarding its own nuclear weapons program, and besides Iran nuclear program comes from the 50s, with the Atoms for Peace american program. So what´s exactly the hurry?  Why drop diplomacy right now that finally a positive step was given? "
">The argument of energy independence rang hollow because Iran did not have a fuel fabrication facility. This meant that their indigenously enriched uranium would still have to be exported for fabrication into fuel elements and re-imported, leaving them still vulnerable to foreign pressure. If they now have an operational fabrication facility, they will complete the front-end nuclear fuel production, making their energy independence arguments for enrichment more plausible, or at least less implausible.

http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2009/04/1106.php

Iran still does not have a fuel fabrication facility, the deal they just signed with Brazil refers to the steps needed to make fuel rods for the Arak reactor - (only France and Argentina still have fuel fabrication facilites, hence they are mentioned)

"India, PAK, NK and Israel didn't sign the NPT. (well nk did, but they withdrew)

Why are you trying to defend Iran's violations of treaties?

Don't you think the US should be held to account when it violates treaties it signs?

>So what´s exactly the hurry?

Because we don't want Nuclear Weapons to Proliferate.  Do you want *more* nukes around?  I mean come on buddy!"
Interesting.  Iran can enrich Uranium to 20% 235 but probably could not make it into fuel rods for its research reactor.  It would seem that the whole swap deal was just a game to get western countries to supply rods to Iran at no cost.  I'm left wondering why the US/EU ever made the offer in the first place.  Any help?
"If I signed a treaty saying I would - wouldn't I be obligated?

Iran signed the NPT.  They must abide by their obligations to the treaty?

Put it another way - do you believe the US should abide by the treaties it signs?"
But of course - so you'll agree that sanctions on Iran should proceed then yes?
Troll.
"I´m not defending nuclear weapons, I´m just saying that US will sanction Iran whatever or not they have nuclear capability, and that is just plainly wrong, as much was the fictional WMDs in Iraq. Do you think that sanctions will create what? Just a more defensive Iranian response, which will be to accelerate the pursuit of nuclear weapons, just what happened with North Korea."
">Why are you trying to defend Iran's violations of treaties?

They have the right to enrich under the treaty.

>Don't you think the US should be held to account when it violates treaties it signs?

US has never been held to account for breaking treaties.

>Because we don't want Nuclear Weapons to Proliferate. Do you want more  nukes around? I mean come on buddy!

Absolutely. It's the only thing that will prevent war."
"To try to get the 3.5% out of Iran so they don't have the capability to 'break out' like NK did when it left the NPT.

Do you honestly think Iran isn't trying for nuclear weapons?

I mean come on man."
What obligation of the NPT are they not living up to?
What makes you think that? Because I argue for equality in international agreements? Sanctions have a terrible record of being completely ineffectual while causing incredible harm to the citizens of the target country. 
">But of course - so you'll agree that sanctions on Iran should proceed then yes?

Right after sanctions are imposed on israel and the US."
Don't you think the US should be held to account when it violates treaties it signs?
So you think Iran should lower themselves to the level of the US?  Why?
"You realize they are under 3 sets of sanctions for not complying with the IAEA right?

This is old old news man, this 'sanctions' talk is about the 4th round, not the 1st."
">What makes you think that?

Because Iran is in violation of the NPT of course!  Don't you want Iran to live up to it's treaty obligations?

>Sanctions have a terrible record of being completely ineffectual while causing incredible harm to the citizens of the target country.

Ah, so you don't want 'sanctions all round' then at all do you?

(FYI, the sanctions they are talking about with Iran will be to inspect shipping, not to withhold baby food or something like that)
"
Ahhh the 'joooos' are the problem.  I see.
"What violation are you talking about? Iran did NOT violate the NPT yet, it´s still a Hillary Clinton accusation; but what you have to say about US that violated the NPT cooperating with Indian´s nuclear capability? But then who would sanction US?"
">So you think Iran should lower themselves to the level of the US? Why?

To prevent war. "
"How is not complying with the IAEA different from not living up to an obligation of the NPT?  I guess I'm just trying to find out what they are doing which is a violation.  The UNSC resolution demanded Iran stop all enrichment, I think, and it's because they've continued enriching that sanctions have been passed.  I don't think the enrichment violates the NPT.  "
">Iran did NOT violate the NPT yet,

Um yes they did - they are under 3 sets of sanctions for precisely that."
"You're the same guy who didn't know that Iran can't make fuel rods - right?

No offense - but why should I take your musings here seriously?

Or are you actually asking me a question?"
"[no, they did not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty#Iran), they are accusations, mostly there is no consensus that Iran violated or not the NPT. Egypt is doing worse than Iran and there is no sanctions in the horizon. 

You didn´t answer my question, US violated the NPT with India, wont you address that? "
Actually asking you a question.  
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran#IAEA

I suggest you do some reading before continuing this.

Yes - Iran is under sanctions for it's violations.  That is not up for debate.  It is fact."
">Iran is a party to the NPT, but was found in non-compliance with its NPT safeguards agreement and the status of its nuclear program remains in dispute. November 2003 IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei reported that Iran had repeatedly and over an extended period failed to meet its safeguards obligations, including by failing to declare its uranium enrichment program

That's the first sentence of your link.

How is it that you read 'non-compliance' to be 'compliance'?

We'll get to USA and India when we finish with the Iran issue.  You're not in any rush right?"
"keep reading:

> IAEA Board of Governors found in a rare non-consensus decision with 12 abstentions that these failures constituted non-compliance with the IAEA safeguards agreement.

If is that obvious, why there is no consensus? Why punish with absolute penalties an entire population with heavy sanctions? There are dozen countries, including Brazil that had worse accusations, but didn't go forward. You are using double standards here and promoting conflict, these sanctions are likely going to end in war and invasion in a near future and US will be the one to blame, again. If you are american, be ready for more enemies, you wouldn't fear nuclear attacks without them."
"You were the one who said countries should live up to their obligations?

I'm not sure why you think Iran should be free to violate the treaties it signs?

"
"oh fucking christ, discussing with you is like entering in a neverending recursion. I give up, I'll let Chomsky to discuss with you:

>Noam Chomsky described the whole story of Iran's nuclear standoff in a nutshell, quoting the former U.S. Secretary of State who frankly confessed that Iran's nuclear dossier is a matter of ""alliance"" and nothing else: ""the basic point was explained very candidly by Henry Kissinger. He was asked by the Washington Post why he now claims that Iran does not need nuclear energy so it must be working on building a bomb, while in the 1970s he insisted forcefully that Iran needs nuclear energy and the U.S. must provide the shah with the means to develop it. His answer was pure Kissinger: ""They were an allied country"" so they needed nuclear energy. Now they are not an ally, so they do not need nuclear energy. "

"Sadly, sanctions tend to make the common people suffer, and not their corrupt leaders. They can even strengthen the regime by uniting the population under the ""anti-sanctioner"" banner."
">the American-led sanctions meant to force Iran to stop enriching uranium

First, that's not even what the law says.  The law lists a half dozen conditions which have nothing to do with Uranium.  And second, come on, the sanctions are most likely meant to destroy the economy so we face less trouble when we invade.  "
"Well said. Sanctions are a form of economic war targeting civilians. 

The sanctions in Iraq caused infant mortality rates to rise to 11% and childhood mortality rates between the ages of 3 and 5 to rise to 13%. 

The sanctions against Iran are intended to do the same thing."
"And those sanctions didn't even touch Saddam, but rather strangled a population past the point of submission.
You think Iranian leaders are going hungry because of these sanctions? "
"Yea, the leaders usually have the money to still buy w/e the hell they like. 

Does anyone really think Kim Jong Il was eating fried flower and bark soup for dinner like the peasants? "
You know the U.S isn't the only one with sanctions against Iran right? Unless you think the EU is in on this conspiracy. 
So I take it you are opposed to the arab boycott of Israel?  Since it is a form of economic war targetting civilians and all?
You think the US and EU are not coordinated here?  That seems a rare opinion.  
"I am not. 

The boycott of Israel is not intended to starve people. "
No I don't think the US and EU are coordinating a long term plan for invasion of Iran. Not sure I've seen that theory around here.
The intent is the same.    Both are forms of economic war targetting civilians.   Apparently your feigned morality doesn't extend to Israelis.
"Sanctions, coordinated on sanctions.  I thought that was clear, sorry.  "
"My morality is in no way feigned.

Sanctions by a global superpower aimed at starving people into rebellion do not compare to boycotts against a military superpower aimed at weakening Israel's ability to continue war crimes.

Sanctions are not boycotts.

Targeting a country without nuclear power is different than targeting a country with nuclear weapons and the world's second largest army.

That's the difference between the two.

"
It was very clear. Popcom is just really thick.
"Your morality is feigned, since you don't really have a problem with collective punishment.  You are just upset that the collective punishment that you favor isn't as succesful as the collective punishment you don't like.

Sanctions and the arab boycott are exactly the same.  Sanctions by a global superpower to prevent a genocidal government from obtaining nuclear weapons does not compare to boycotts aimed at a country of six million to force them to commit suicide.  I guess it is a matter of perspective.

And, btw, your making up facts doesn't exactly butress your points. Iran's army is bigger than Israels.  In no world does Israel have the second largest army in the world.   Where do you come up with your ""facts""?"
"Well... in all fairness Israel is the modern day champion of collective punishment.

That's fucking retarded. There's no other word for that.
Infant mortality and child mortality rates haven't risen in Israel because of the boycott. Israel still has the right to trade with whoever it wants without reprisal. 

And I'm not making up facts, Israel is armed to the teeth with advanced weapons. Iran has Soviet era weapons. 

But I've talked to enough Zionazis on here to be tired of their racist, one sided nonsense.

you can respond but I will not read nor reply. Bye"
"Oh, i'm not disagreeing that the arab boycott hasn't been nearly as succesful.  The intent is the same, though.

You claimed Israel had the second largest army in the world.  You were wrong - and are again moving the goalposts/just making shit up.

And yeah, I've talked to enough nazis on here to be tired of your racist, one sided nonsense.

"""acknowledges"" would be a better word choice than ""admits""."
"Kerry admits sky blue, grass green.

What is the story here exactly?"
"no shit. Iran has a history of supporting terror groups and yet reddit still loves them for ""agreeing"" to a nuke deal."
As opposed to the 100% of US aid to al-Qaeda that went to financing terrorism.
"I know! Is inexcusable that terrorist groups go around driving Toyota trucks and Humvees and firing M16s and TOW missiles while paying people with dollars... 

Those damn Iranians, at least their involvement is well documented, unlike other countries where you basically just need them carrying the white, red and blue."

"Having lived at a time in a country that had crippling US sanctions on it for very little reason, in fact the same reason, I can safely say these sanctions will do nothing except piss people off about the US and make it more unpopular among ordinary and educated Iranis. It will do nothing to halt the nuclear program or destabilise the regime. "
"That's the whole idea.

Sanctions are designed to hurt as many ordinary citizens as possible. You can't bomb every square inch of a country but you can cause misery, pain, starvation, disease etc for hundreds of millions of people with sanctions.

I'm sure we can go through another discussion of why Iran deserves a nuclear program and what not, but if the bottom line is simply that the US just doesn't want Iran to have a nuclear enrichment program, and Iran absolutely wants one, then how does this clear example of conflict of interest proceed?"

"The double standard only exists if you believe any of the garbage in the media.  What has always been the case is nations doing what they can to secure their own interests.

Iran has a goal in mind as well.

Just look at how these hardships conveniently take place before elections. In a country that has already protested election results. A year after the Arab Spring. I think there is a hidden agenda to this that the media doesn't know.
i understand what he is referring too. but a big reason they had the dust bowl was because farmers didn't treat the land right leaving the top soil exposed and susceptible to wind erosion. that would not happen today. while their may be a drought and crops may die you would not see the dust bowl affect again or at least at such a grand scale and that's all i meant.

Quite sad reading the comments on CNN with people actually believing that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons. 
Why did Obama sanction a Chinese bank for dealing with Iran? Does he not know that his and EU's sanctions have no say whatsoever in any other country?
"It makes perfect sense that Iran would want nuclear weapons, and given the amount of problems Iran has had regarding their nuclear program, it doesn't take a degree in nuclear science to become suspicious."
Especially after the hundreds of thousands killed in Iraq sanctions.
Quite naive of you to believe they're not.  
"Actually, reading the comments make me sad I live in the same country with these people. Obama this, Romney that, evil zionists, warmongering Iranians. "
"Of course they're trying to make nuclear weapons. They'd be monumental  idiots not to be. Getting a nuke is pretty much they're only long term solution to ensuring their sovereignty. If Syria had a nuke do you think any of those rebel groups would get back-door supply from the west? Fuck no, having a nuke ensures that western powers have a very real interest in the stability of your government. Just ask Pakistan. "

> don't be impatient with ambiguity. there is proof, it's just difficult to obtain without getting killed.

You have offered zero proof, and incredible accusations against America's first black president.  I'd say you have a lot to ask yourself when you wake up and see yourself in the mirror staring back at you.

Questions like: ""Why?""  ""Why am I posting this on Reddit about Obama in the days after the State of the Union""?  ""What do I look like to other people, who require facts, instead of 'feelings'?""

You're defaming our president with ZERO proof.  Until you offer any, you're a con-man attempting to lie yourself into importance.

> like your faith in the 19 hijacker story when faced with evidence that it is impossible, and not proven by any means.

"*Are you allergic to facts and citations?*

Seriously... you have offered me nothing except your ramblings.

I've asked you for links, citations, and proof repeatedly.  

Your words are those of a con man liar who wants to get attention by saying incredibly awful things without proof.

> You have a nice story, but it's just a story. Meanwhile we know that the FBI was involved in blowing up the same buildings in 1993, and there is proof of explosive residue in the dust.

No, you have a sad story... and you have no proof for it... so only you can live in your fantasy reality that you've constructed, since the rest of us follow wikipedia and basic news sources... not your delusional ramblings without a single link to a reputable source of proof."

"Links look like this:

Try out sourcing reality, instead of babbling paranoia without proof."

"Cute sentence structuring, but it still doesn't substitute for citation... or how this has any relevance to this story in question... in short, you're attention trolling without any proof.

Good bye"
"Look, how exactly would there be DNA evidence of a hijacking? Every bit if organic matter in those planes were incinerated, or else hopelessly scattered. The evidence you're asking for is impossible to gather, and it's basically irrelevant besides. What is the presence or absence of DNA supposed to prove? Just because CSI finds DNA doesn't mean investigations require it."
"Good on them. Hopefully it will force America to actually negotiate, since sanctions without China and Russia mean nothing to Iran."
Russia is already on board with sanctions.
"You can't negotiate with Iran unless you have a carrot (diplomatic relations) and a stick (sanctions)

This tells the Iranians they can treat the negotiations with as much contempt as they have so far with total impunity.

Don't get me wrong - I think the negotiations are a waste of time even with sanctions. In fact I'd call them off and keep the current EU/US sanctions. The odds are that Iran will nuclearise anyhow. Still they will only have a few dozen rather primitive ICBMs in the near future. These could be shot down with missile defence and in any case the regime could be deterred.

In the long run I think the only solution is to promote regime change within Iran. Invading is out of the question but the student movement seems to be slowly eating away at the regime all on its own. I'd provide vocal support for this and donate money whilst treating the current regime as illegitimate. I.e. follow the game plan with Eastern European communist regimes. Any action taken should be agreed with Iranian opposition people though.

Once the regime goes I'd negotiate with great fanfare - E.g. the Secretary of State flying to Iran and then the new Iranian President visiting Washington to meet with the POTUS. At this point I'd offer and end to sanctions in return for getting rid of the nukes. Also the US could unblock Iran's access to international trade and offer to buy up weapons grade material at above market prices.

The best case would be that a democratic Iran would disarm voluntarily like South Africa did. The worst case is that they'd not have missiles on hair trigger alert and maybe be a 'silent' nuclear power like Israel or Japan. Still if they're democratic it's likely that they would stop targeting the US and eventually reach a modus vivendi with Israel."
"In name only. Aside from the missile thing, trade has been more or less constant."
"First, sanctions aren't a very good stick, Iran has been under some form of sanction from America since the 1970s and don't seem to mind. Second, the whole secretly promoting regime change thing is already happening, remember the bombings in Sistan-Baluchistan? Jundallah is in all probability funded by the US. This actually harms us in the long run because an unstable Iran means things spill over into Iraq and Afghanistan. Third, since when do we give a fuck about whether a regime is democratic or not?

Finally, as for the Carrot, we've already done Iran the biggest favor possible by taking out the Sunni regime in Iraq and opening the door for an Alliance of Shia dominated countries all the way to the Mediterranean."
"Why on earth does Iran has to negotiate with anybody? Especially with a blood thirsty, oil-hungry imperial regime from Washington, DC?"
"They've already stopped the Busher plant.  Yeah, Iran thought they could buy Friendship from Russia.

Turns out anyone can buy friendship from Russia.

Oh well!  Sucks for Iran!"
"Because they signed the NPT.  IF they withdraw from that treaty, then they don't need to negotiate with anyone.

But then of course the whole world will know they are liars and were trying to make weapons the whole time."
You mean the Bushehr plant that's completed and running through final testing before starting production? Your news is a little out of date.
"Like the whole world knows what a liar Saddam Husein was?

Until US provides a proof that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction/organized attacks on WTC any word of imperial Washington, DC does not worth a dime.

edit: I've forgot illegal tortures, but that's a different topic"
It's not completed or running.  What are you yapping about?
it's neither completed nor operational.  A simple google check reveals that.  Are you even trying anymore?
"Iraq had no WMD's and didn't attack the WTC.  This was admitted by the Bush Administration years ago.  

What are you talking about?"
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushehr_Nuclear_Power_Plant

from the article: 

In March, 2009, the head of Russia's state nuclear power corporation Rosatom, Sergei Kiriyenko, announced that Russia had completed the construction of the plant. A series of pre-launch tests were conducted after the announcement.[10] Iranian Energy Minister Parviz Fattah has said that the Bushehr plant would begin producing 500 MW of its 1,000 MW capacity of electricity by 22 August 2009, and would be brought up to full capacity by the end of March 2010.[11]

In September 22, 2009 it was reported that the first reactor was 96% complete and final testing would begin in the near future.[12] In early October final testing was started.
"
"So the ongoing occupation of Iraq is not justified?

I am talking about that in order to be consistent, US has to observe and fix its own flaws before it can go out and tell others what they are allowed to do."
"http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90854/6574553.html

You've got to stay up to date if you wan't to debate things like this.

Seriously, 5 seconds on google would have been enough for you to check that you are wrong."
"Well if it was up to me, we'd have been gone years ago preferable never at all - is that what you are asking?

The US is a democracy, we change our path constantly.  We're under no obligation to you to be consistent.

We're not the authority telling Iran anything.  Iran signed the NPT, we're just agreeing with the IAEA that they should abide by it.



"
"speaking of staying up to date, perhaps you should take a look at the top of the article. See that number? January 15 2009, you're the one who's a little out of date.

Did you actually read the article? Because the main point of it is that Russia will complete the plant in 2009.

some quotes:

  Iran's ambassador to Russia Mahmoud Reza Sajjadi said that Russia would complete Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant this year, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Wednesday. 

  The main problem with the plant, that of the fuel supply, had been solved and the doubts whether the plant would start operation had already been removed, he said, adding that ""Russians are trying to accelerate the process and hundreds of Iranian engineers who have been trained in Russia are replacing Russian experts."" 

  However, completion of the plant has been repeatedly delayed. The construction of the plant is at its last stages and Russians have promised to complete it in 2009, according to the Iranian media.

">We're not the authority telling Iran anything. Iran signed the NPT, **we're just agreeing with the IAEA that they should abide by it**.

Under the NPT, Iran has the right to build nuclear facilities and persue nuclear technology for non-military purposes.  That right is being denied to them based on the suspicion that they may, at some point in the future, use that technology for military purposes.  As such, the US and Europe are the aggressor here by denying Iran its rights under the NPT. 

Meanwhile, the US continues to ignore its obligations under the NPT by maintaining its oversized nuclear arsenal and continuing to research new nuclear weapons for potential use (bunker-busters).

Forgive me if I find the US position utterly hypocritical and unfounded."
">That right is being denied to them based on the suspicion that they may, at some point in the future, use that technology for military purposes. As such, the US and Europe are the aggressor here by denying Iran its rights under the NPT.

Not according to the IAEA.

You proclaim that somehow this is the US positoin, again the US has nothing to do with this.  The IAEA is the authority here.

Address them if you want to address anyone."
">Not according to the IAEA.

The US forms its policies and positions regardless of the IAEA, all the while applying pressure on the IAEA to conform to US expectations.  I have been following the IAEA flip-flops and hemming and hawing from the very beginning of this debacle, and am hardly impressed by all parties involved.

It is beyond obvious that the US has a geostrategic interest in seeing either regime change or political collapse in Iran, and that sanctions is the clumbsy tool they are using at the moment."
"So your argument is that your opinion is that you are correct.

Interesting."
"ha ha,, mind if I use that one sometime"
And you seem to have a little too much trust in the good will of the same USA that has been shafting Iran since before 1953.
"LOL Again this is not the US, this is the IAEA.

Watch out, the CIA are probably following you!"
but what about the survival of the jewish race?
http://mamul.am/en/news/73833/
People aren't happy with the cost of getting some Americans back and some are pissed not all of them were released. I propose those who bitch come up with a plan that doesn't involve military action. 
"""When implementation of the Iran nuclear pact was looming and a secret prisoner swap deal in the works, Obama administration officials called the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early January to ask him to put a hold on calls for sanctions over Tehran's missile test, the senator told Reuters.

Senator Bob Corker is the first U.S. senator to confirm reports by Reuters that there was a link between the Obama administration's delaying sanctions over Iran's ballistic missile program and efforts to free Americans held prisoner there.

He had hoped that the ballistic sanctions would be imposed before the nuclear sanctions were lifted."""
[deleted]
That's so racist.
"Cause the Chinese are backing Iran, not Amurikuh"
"Or maybe they just don't believe the US propaganda about the evils of Iran, since even Defense Secretary Panetta admits that they [aren't actually trying to build nuclear weapons](http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/01/08/400092/panetta-iran-nuclear-weapon/)"
"Yeah, but for them to say that the problems should be solved through dialogue??  That's Crazy!"
Remember when Obama said he would sit down personally and talk with Ahmedinijad and other world leaders who aren't so keen on the US? What the fuck happened to that?
"Its got to be a better thing to try instead of just going in, all bombs blazing, which seems to be what Israel and the USA are trying to encourage.

The US hasn't tried talking to Iran for years, it has threatened them, it has forced sanctions on them, it is probably partially responsible for shooting and blowing up their scientists, it has constantly lied about them to the international community. It has **not** tried discussion. Thats a bully mentality, not a mature nation."
"Well, to be honest to Obama - I think the offer still stands.  However, expecting the Iranians to jump into his lap while he's torching international law in order to bring them in front of the UNSC doesn't seem genuine.

They've also ignored Iranian overtures, such as the latest offer to talk to the Europeans at the end of December.  It looks as though somethings going on in the background, so hopefully they can get something going.  

Seems like China's the only rational player left in game."
[That's not entirely true](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8577618.stm)...
[I took another look.](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyharnden/3659501/Barack_Obamas_unconditional_meeting_with_President_Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad/)   It seems he took a shitkicking from all sides when he said that.  I don't understand how the current approach can still be considered the best way.  Why can't this be hashed out mano-e-mano?  I'm sure it would save a shitload of lives.
"Correct, he offered to talk while increasing sanctions against them and badmouthing them internationally. Seems like a great way to give them the confidence that they will be listened to.

Basically, he has tried nothing at all that could give them any reason to believe that the US political and war machine will treat them fairly or honestly."
I feel like you read that article and then created a narrative in your head in order to reconcile your preconceived notions of U.S. Iran relations and the facts the BBC is presenting...
"Maybe, except that the article clearly discusses Washington's ongoing attempts to increase sanctions and their criticism of Iran. Yes, I know that Ahmadinjed is a nutcase, and is hanging onto power by appealing to Iranian nationalism (which is only encouraged by recent US actions) and that they have a major persecution complex (much of which is actually reasonably justified) and that Iran wouldn't be a fun place to live. Also that the real power is held by the Ayotollahs who aren't likely to release that hold just because the USA kills several hundred of their people with increased sanctions.

But are they a military threat to **anyone** ? No, certainly not the USA (but then, neither was Iraq, was it ?)

are they a political threat to anyone ? Yes, potentially to a lot of the middle east, ever since the US screwed up Iraq so much, Iran has gained politically across the region, and Israel and the USA hate that.

Doesn't make either one right and the other wrong, it actually makes both wrong. Except that the USA is interfering in a region that it really has no right to be, it is throwing its weight around and causing the deaths of many people through war and sanctions which is totally unnecessary. So maybe if the USA stopped interfering in so many nations, Iran might actually have the opportunity to grow up without so much interference."
">are they a political threat to anyone ? Yes, potentially to a lot of the middle east, ever since the US screwed up Iraq so much, Iran has gained politically across the region, and Israel and the USA hate that.

I-what?  First, Iran is the most isolated it's been since the revolution, second, Iran is the only Shia majority nation in the area, that has always been the core reason why they have very little political influence in that area of the world..."
"except in Iraq, as well documented [here](http://www.christianpost.com/news/irans-growing-influence-in-middle-east-is-aided-by-us-says-expert-60872/) and [here](http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2011/Oct-24/152039-iran-influence-high-as-us-moves-to-withdraw-iraq-troops.ashx#axzz1jEP7TDMn)

There is quite a lot of evidence of Iran's rising tide of influence locally, with Iraq, Palestine, some with Syria. And the more the US demonizes them, the more the locals start to sympathize with them"
">Well documented

The Christian Post is super weird for you to be quoting, considering it seems like the article is pro-war with Iraq..."
"so try some other options

[bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-30/iran-influence-in-azerbaijan-may-unsettle-bp-s-oil-investments.html), the [telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/lebanon/8277240/Iran-and-Syria-use-Hizbollah-to-seize-influence-over-Lebanon.html), [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15724404), 

basically Iranian influence has grown and changed, partially filling the vacuum of Iraq, and partially by the popular rejection of American involvement"
"But these articles betray your original point that Iran's influence comes from U.S. involvement, or that their influence is growing.  Iran has used Hezbollah for 3 decades now in Lebanon, and Azerbaijan has had close ties to Iran for centuries:

But, I liked your BBC article, very balanced.

I implore anyone who is an American to phone your politicians and tell them this deal has to go. The iranian government is rife with human rights abuse records and is in no way deserving of an influx of money from their frozen assets to further their jihadist cause.

This end of the world event has surprisingly gone quiet.
"The reality is that in healthy democracies their are debates within the country. Israel doesn't think monolithic. Take a look at how many political parties their are in Israel and the nature of politicking there to gain seats in a Parliamentary system. I would actually argue that you have more views expressed than in our American political system where Progressive voices often get drowned out. The Mossad reports directly to the Prime Minister but its under no obligation to be a rubber stamp for the Prime Minister. With elections looming in a couple of months, their might be political support behind the scenes for some anonymous officials to come out like this. "
"""Anonymous mossad officials"" I wouldn't put too much into that. "
"Conveniently that skepticism is totally absent when ""Anonymous mossad officials"" say something you like.

As the Bloomberg report notes the source isn't ""Anonymous mossad officials"" it was a US congress delegation that visited Israel and reported they received contradictory briefings from Israeli officials one of them being Mossad."
"Where did you get that from? Show me at least one comment I made, that supports what you claim."
"In fairness, you are posting the same comment saying it's meaningless in multiple articles about this. It's kinda a weird thing to do unless your goal is to get people to ignore the story."

Israel's lap dog ratchets up the tension some more. 
Enough is enough already. The US really needs to rethink its foreign policy. 
"yep these sanctions will teach those Iranians a thing or too

their people will really love USA now!
America had 1 thing going for them in Iran. The people loved America. hate the government.. but love Americans.  These sanctions only bring complete ill to all Americans. These sanctions are unjust. unlawful, and truely Acts of WAR.

The Mullahs pockets are still filling up. their stomachs are full.. and they are happy. These sanctions are only effecting the people on the street."

How democratic...
What they're trying to hide is that these Israeli groups are working hand-in-glove with the US govt.
"Which really sucks since Iran has NEVER been proven to be attempting to achieve weapons grade nuclear material! The IAEA have investigated ALL of the claims against Iran and they have PROVEN there is absolutely no intent to achieve such a grade. They are ONLY getting it to energy grade!

Besides why does Israel **REFUSE** to allow weapons inspectors to check *Their* nuclear weapons grade manufacturing? (That they are NOT supposed to have)"
Israel has no obligation to invite inspectors into their country. The only reason Iran is obligated to do it is because they signed onto the NPT. And who says they're not supposed to have it?!?
"Israel has refused repeated weapons inspections! And it has been proven either Israel **Stole** nukes from America, or our corrupt government **Sold** them to Israel. Against the NPT!! So yes they are NOT supposed to have those nukes, because America wasnt supposed to provide them any! And your correct Iran signed the NPT ... before MOST countries signed it... they dont WANT ANY nuke weaponry! 

Besides they are SURROUNDED by American nukes, so whats the big deal? The biggest murderers in the world have *""LEGITIMATE""* nukes... who cares if Iran has some to defend themselves from these murderers!"
"you are paranoid and delusional. Take your mess before you hurt yourself.

After they kick in, go read the actual history of Israel's nuclear program rather than conspiracy web sites. Israel developed their nuclear program with South Africa. At some point they even developed a faster cheaper method for refining uranium that doesn't require mountains full of centrifuges, which is part of the reason why nobody knows how many nukes they might have at this point."
"go read the IAEA website where they clearly state Iran is not trying to acquire weapons grade material, nor have any indications they are trying to. Go read your conspiracy theory websites... Israeli and American television!

How many people have Israel attacked in the last 60 years. Then see how many countries Iran has attacked! Heres a hint for the idiots in the class Iran has attacked EXACTLY **ZERO** Israel? Shall we start with Egypt? and end with Palestine? Or do you prefer latest to longest ago? Because theres a few dozen in between! How many countries have America attacked? Start with the Spanish American war started over the USS Maine... I bet you are too stupid to even know anything about that ship, or event. Check out what the Captain said about the event LMAO! Or lets go to Israel trying to get the American people involved in its war with Egypt by working together with our President. By ""allowing"" the Israeli forces to attack the USS Liberty... oh **another** event you know nothing about! Or how about the fact the even Congress learned the ""Underwear bomber"" was facilitated to happen by an American operative. Or how about the ""Christmas tree bomber"" ooops that was thwarted by American citizens, so it became a ""sting operation"" instead of a terrorist attack. Check out the 3 bombs that had to be dismantled in the OKC bombing (do you really think McVeigh could have driven the truck AND planted 3 other bombs in the ATF building by himself? Not to mention not a single ATF was inside the building (but they left the daycare full to make you hate McVeigh and guns (was supposed to be Militia, Michigan to be specific... but records proved he was military and not Militia) Check out the 95 bombing of the twin towers where even mainstream media reported that the ""mastermind"" recorded his conversation with his FBI handler, about **REAL** explosives being used in this 'drill' instead of the agreed upon fake explosives. 

There is so little you understand about this and world aspects, for sure look up ""Operation Northwoods"" (doubt you will for fear of what you might find I am sure) most will say ""Yeah but so what JFK stopped it"" Whats the big deal?? REALLY WTF this is PROOF that our government PLANNED on murdering Americans on American soil and hijack airplanes!!! I say THANK GOD we had a good man to ""stop it"" for us... do you think Obamney will ""stop it"" and save us? LMFAO If you **seriously** trust your government THAT much, dont reply, just stop wasting air others with thinking minds can better utilize, ty"
so... I see you're not taking my advice on taking your meds then...

Then what the hell are you doing here? Looking for /r/shopping or /r/soapoperatoday or /r/lizardlicktowing? try a search, then bookmark it, it will help you avoid such information much more effectively!"
"Tell you what... Instead, why don't you go look up the fact that there's scotch guard in your body and in your organic food and the fact that it's bioaccumilative.... There's much more scary, dangerous stuff in the real world than in your conspiratorial kiddy pool, but the fact that somewhere deep inside you know that you should be doubting the conspiracy theories makes you sleep better at night. Why don't you open up your eyes a little bit and live in the stark terror reality actually demands."
"why would I try to attempt to be stupid like you? I used to think it was all bullshit, but I **LEARNED** I skipped my fears (that you are clinging to) and I investigated the claims instead of (like you are) cowering to even consider such things... I gave you real history, and you convince yourself it didnt happen, or its not worth your attention... why? **BECAUSE YOU ARE A CHICKEN SHIT COWARD!!!**

I know your fear, I felt it, too afraid to consider, too chicken shit to think about any of it, no matter how much evidence is shoved in your face. I was once like you, self imposing ignorance for FEAR to even look LOLOL are you a fucking adult? Then start acting like it you chicken shit COWARD!

Look up Operation Northwoods... if you arent to much a coward piece of shit!"
"There's nothing special about Northwoods... false flags are just a thing that you do when they need to be done.

However, the fact that false flags exist doesn't mean that most and definitely not all flags are false. For example, Israel has every reason to shoot up the USS Liberty and none of it requires a conspiracy, it just requires understanding what Israel was doing the the Sinai desert at that moment that they didn't want the US (who was not their ally yet) to see...
"
"Murdering American on American soil is ""OK"" because the government wanting to murder people in other countries while murdering our troops is ""needed to be done""? Seriously? And you consider yourself a human being? Seriously?

I guess thats a French ""surrender to whoever is in charge"" attitude... I'll let them know that your loved ones should be murdered for the good of the country, please submit their names ages addresses and phone numbers to the ""Dictator"" process you agree with. Hopefully our government will waste their lives to get more money. Wow the new American ""Justice for all"" is more of a ""hide in the dark do whatever they say COWARD"" attitude instead!

But hey when you think they can do no wrong, and anything they do to us is ok, then you're a spineless weak, subservient to them and their wishes. America IS her people, and there is **never** a justification to murder our people! But a coward would be very willing to accept such a dictatorship, as its also the LAZY mans way! Coward, subservient AND lazy... you must be so proud!

[EDIT:] and the President of the united states was heard saying ""I want that God damn ship on the ocean floor"" when they called to confirm the ""recall the birds"" order that DC gave to the 2 aircraft carriers that were less then 2 miles away from the USS Liberty, after they already launched fighters to preotect the USS Liberty. Why dont you get some fucking brains and look up the ""Gulf of Tonkin"" ... it never even happened, but how many AMERICANS lost their lives in Vietnam over this **LIE**, that you say is ""OK""?"
"Your mistake is to think that there's a ""them""... There's no ""them""... there's only us. The only thing that's changed with the introduction of democracy is that we no longer behead people to make changes.

"Sorry I do not refer to THEIR instructioning to understand how humanity is to work, ... there is a ""Them"" and ""us"" ... why is it THEY think they can MURDER us to get THEM what THEY want? And why do YOU accept this like a good servant, to THEM being so much better then US... you're a coward! I should also point out WE fight THEIR wars, we DIE for THEM, they **LIE** to us and make shit up to make US believe we are dying for US, where-as we are dying and MURDERING innocent people for THEM.

Ask yourself dumbass why every country we ""Liberate"" gets stuck into a perpetual debt under a centralized banking institution just like the Federal reserve? Why are ALL of these nations in DESPICABLE conditions now? Because the lazy cowards who see the government as a GOD and never questions it like an ANTI-American terrorist enjoys seeing!

A man in a cave with a cellphone and a laptop cannot damage our freedoms, that is done by THEM in office, with the ONLY ability to destroy the Constitution. And our cowards (you) and our soldiers are NOT defending the Constitution by ""accepting"" the government as a God, to start wars to murder its own soldiers for profits and oppress other nations, is DESTROYING our freedoms!

Wake the fuck up, I listed MANY murders of Americans by inside the government, and you say ""oh thats ok they were worthless to the state"" your master called, he said ""Send that bitch of mine into the bathroom, so he can suck my balls till I shit in his mouth"" so, I'll let you go, I know how serving the very wealthy and maybe getting some scraps from their nutsack is to some of you... so dont contact me back until after you brush your teeth and grow some balls of your own. Good bye coward!"
"Because given the opportunity to push a button to kill a random kid in Nigeria in order to get a 5% discount on our monthly gas bill, 99.999% of us push that button without thinking twice about it. Better yet, we pay people large sums of money to keep us from having to think about it too much.

We just uncovered bio/chem warfare tests that were being conducted in St. Louis.... other than going through the motions of filing a complaint with the military, you think anyone actually cares about this?!?"
">given the opportunity to push a button to kill a random kid in Nigeria in order to get a 5% discount on our monthly gas bill, 99.999% of us push that button without thinking twice about it

What sick twisted world do YOU live in?? I know of no person that would do that for money (saving on fuel (fixed BS price setting, and BS rumors we dont have enough)) this is why they must say OMG WMD's to get our soldiers to do it for them. Or ""Throwing babies out of incubators, raping all the women, cutting the breasts off of little girls... **ALL FUCKING ADMITTED LIES!!!!** (after the murdering began) Where are those fucking WMD's that over 1 million children died to find?

Yes I know about the bio/warfare testing, glad to see you admit that THAT happened (there must be an angle of propaganda in it for you to be mentioning it... maybe an ""elect Obama"" campaign... interesting, I will pay closer attention to that now) thats not even HALF of what is really going on. 

Instead of todays news, maybe you'd listen history? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZU0c8DAIU4 1958, lays it all out, and its all happening in order. Only a complete moron would think this was a coincidence! (or too cowardly to watch)"
"I am really proud of Brazil. As a brazillian I think Lula has done an excellent job. 

This sanctions are pure hipocrecy. Israel has nuclear weapons is occupying palestine, attacked other countries, threats other countries, helped South Africa with nuke weapons technology and still this UN Sec Council is doing nothing against them. Iran does not deserve this. US has surrounded them with troops and they have never attacked militarily anyone.

I dont know what US promised to Russia and China. But must be something big. "
What about the sanctions for the rogue state in the Middle East **WITH** a secret stockpile of nuclear weapons?  Shouldn't they be subject to even more restrictive sanctions until they permit full IAEA safeguards?
suprise suprise straight after the builderberg meeting they suddenly agree sanctions
At least enough concessions to China and Russia were made so as to render them totally toothless.
"It's also interesting what Iran will do with respect to Afghanistan. The US can use them against the taliban, but if Iran is sanctioned like this, they likely will not help the US in afghanistan. 

"
"As a fellow Brazilian, I agree with you. Until we get our seat, though, nothing to do but symbolic acts like those that Brazil did."
The difference between Israel (and Pakistan and India) and Iran is that Iran signed the non-proliferation treaty and the others did not.  That is the basis for the sanctions against Iran.
">Until we get our seat, though, nothing to do but symbolic acts like those that Brazil did.

You'll get there eventually (a seat or enough political influence).  And this sets a good precedent."
"Sanctions hurt ordinary people, but they are effective because it puts a lot of pressure on their economy. Why do you think Iran is even at the table, they need the sanctions lifted before it does even more damage to the economy. "
"Sanctions only ever hurt ordinary people, the whole world knows this.
"
Can we get over Iran already? Too much news about it.
I'm sorry the news of preventing a potential nuclear arms race in the Middle East bores you.
Sabotaging a deal is what would encourage Iran to seek weapons and start an arms race.  Sort of like when [Bush sabotaged](http://www.mahablog.com/oldsite/id34.html) the efforts Clinton and South Korea had put into North Korea.
">He also urged the international community to give Tehran ""guarantees that it will not be attacked"" by the US and its staunch ally Israel. 

And what does he want from them in return for this guarantee?

Does anyone know why Brazil is backing Iran? I'm assuming there are major financial reasons but I don't know."
"BRAZIL! BRAZIL! BRAZIL! BRAZIL! BRAZIL!

also

IRAN! IRAN! IRAN! IRAN! IRAN! IRAN!"
"Lula wants a spot on the UN Security Council. There is no significant trade happening with Iran and this debacle brings little immediate financial return. The Brazilian government wants to be seen as someone trustworthy that can intervene on behalf of 1st world on the matters of the 3rd world. You can see this by analyzing Brazil's role in Haiti and Honduras, both countries that have little economic relation with Brazil, but provide an opportunity to impress the US and Europe. There is also an attempt to negotiate with the Palestinian Authority and Israel. Iran is another one of those cases.

Back in the Bush administration there was the UN inspection of Brazil's nuclear reactors, which caused some unrest, and the same was being proposed to Iran, so Lula plays this ""victim"" card to Ahmadinejad. It's not ""backing Iran"", it's playing both ways to achieve a goal, the permanent chair at the Security Council. When Hilary came to Brazil Lula's speech change momentarily, agreeing with much of what she came to say. Then it changed back to ""Brazil is a grown up country we can decide our shit"". Lula has leverage because it's one of the few heads of state in the Western hemisphere that has good relations with Ahmadinejad. But it's all power play, the Brazilian and Iranian people have nothing to benefit from this puppeteering."
"> And what does he want from them in return for this guarantee?

No, I think the point is that the U.S. should stop blackmailing Iran, not that they want to do so themselves."
">And what does he want from them in return for this guarantee?

Maybe if they get a guarantee they can compromise on their nuclear power plant building ambitions.

The problem is that the west does not want iran to have the knowledge or the equipment to refine uranium. Everybody knows they are not building a bomb but they are gaining the knowledge to build one.

If the US agrees in writing to attack any country that attacks iran especially israel with specific promises to bomb israel in case of israeli attack they might say ""ok we won't refine it, you build the plant and we will buy the uranium from you"".

If israel never intends to attack iran they would have no objections to this. If the US never intends to attack iran they would have no objections either.

Simple."
"That was an insightful answer that acknowledged that it's all a game played for power (which is the only legitimate answer to these types of questions IMO).

Thanks."
">Everybody knows they are not building a bomb but they are gaining the knowledge to build one.

This is simply not true. (Side point: there is very little worse in a conversation that starting with the phrase ""everybody knows."")

Further, what you're proposing is a defensive pact with the most verbally hostile nation against the US since the Cold War ended. This is not something that comes lightly... not even close to it. Also, your plan involves threatening to bomb one of America's closest allies with respect to military and intelligence.

Lastly, Iran has been fighting a proxy war against Israel for the last decade by supplying weaponry and training to Hamas and Hezbollah. One of the real fears is that they use their refined nuclear material to make some sort of dirty bomb and pass it along to those groups while escaping any retaliation.

Your plan isn't completely terrible if things like history and ego can be removed from the debate but I don't believe political debates can exist without them... what a world it would be though.

edit: Wait, I just realized this was malcontent... ignore my previous statement and just keep being a douche."
Not a problem.
">This is simply not true.

Actually it is.

>Further, what you're proposing is a defensive pact with the most verbally hostile nation against the US since the Cold War ended.

Nonsense. Iran has never threatened the US.  

>Also, your plan involves threatening to bomb one of America's closest allies with respect to military and intelligence.

Israel is more of an enemy than a friend at this stage. 

>Lastly, Iran has been fighting a proxy war against Israel for the last decade by supplying weaponry and training to Hamas and Hezbollah.

So? We train and supply weaponry to israel. What's the big deal. Lots of countries train and supply weapons including israel.

>One of the real fears is that they use their refined nuclear material to make some sort of dirty bomb and pass it along to those groups while escaping any retaliation.

Iran does not have nuclear weapons and they are not working on nuclear weapons.

Those groups could just as easily get a hold of chemical or biological weapons. In fact it would be easier than getting nukes.

>edit: Wait, I just realized this was malcontent... ignore my previous statement and just keep being a douche.

Oh did the truth hurt your feelings again?"
I love you shnookums.
"You keep coming on to me.

I told you that's not appropriate and I am not gay (not that there is anything wrong with that)."
"And as has been said a dozen times here, the nuclear issue is a pretext for sanctions; the most biting sanctions Iran is facing has nothing to do with nuclear power, and will not be lifted regardless of what Iran does with their nuclear program. The US and Israel agree that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon, which is why sanctions under these terms are totally irrelevant as far as nuclear power is concerned.

>Sanctions can only be lifted after the U.S. president certifies to Congress ""that the government of Iran has: (1) released all political prisoners and detainees; (2) ceased its practices of violence and abuse of Iranian citizens engaging in peaceful political activity; (3) conducted a transparent investigation into the killings and abuse of peaceful political activists in Iran and prosecuted those responsible; and (4) made progress toward establishing an independent judiciary."""
Right. How is Iran's currency doing again?
"1 dollar = 34,500 rials as of Thursday. So, not well.  "
"Ya, I'm pretty sure there's nothing that could possibly go wrong as a result of continuing to push Iran into a corner."
"Great! Really smart move U.S.A. Like they needed any more of a reason to say ""screw-it"" and start a war."
"Congress is getting way ahead of itself by trying to rapidly ramp up pressure this way.  I'd much rather we go slowly, wait to see if Iran does something *newly* egregious, or at least until the President and State Department request tightening the screws in response to continued inaction.  The current sanctions are having an effect, and it's better to keep tighter controls in reserve until we actually need them.  Every time we increase the sanctions, it leaves us with fewer threats short of actual violence to hang over the Iranian government.

This strikes me as just adding new sanctions for the sake of *appearing* ""tough on Iran"", rather than in the interest of effective diplomacy."
"Yes, why not? What could go wrong? 
On completely unrelated note I remembered something. After one war, one of winning countries wanted one of the losing countries to be so miserable it could never become military threat again. So this winning country forced really harsh restrictions on the losing country. And thanks to it this losing country was doing really bad and was not threat to anyone. Until came one man with really funny moustache. 
But back to the topic. What could go wrong?"
The US should sanction all countries that are not signatories to the NPT.
It is time to move on and Israel needs to move along too. I'm sure Obama is tired of Israeli intransigence on a number of important issues. 
"> ""To date, Iran has chosen the path of defiance,"" he said.

So Mr. Obama agrees that Iran's crime here is not following orders?"
Why aren't [we sanctioning Israel?](http://www.infiniteunknown.net/2010/06/04/paul-craig-roberts-aipac-owns-the-us-puppet-government/)
because that really worked a treat in iraq in the 90s
"So... more sanctions from countries that haven't traded with Iran in decades? Whoopity do. As for foreign companies, I imagine the ones actually profiting from both Iran and the US will just make shell companies to get around the rules."
It worked on Japan. Amirite?
"The bigger question:  why wasn't Iran on the list of countries to invade and take over post 911?

I have a very, very simple answer for you:  the straits of hormuz.

I'm not sure if Iran realizes this, but by simple artifact of their geographic location, they have inherited a deterrent larger and more effective than the nuclear weapons they're trying to develop.

At this point, the US military's response to a  straits of hormuz incident are a more closely guarded secret than it's nuclear response to, say, Russia or China.

If the destination is what I think it is (military action against Iran) then the new brentton woods that is in the process of formulating involves allowing partners to enter a coalition based on the entry price of knowing what the straits of hormuz action will involve (6 month stock pile, planned interruption of tanker traffic for only 2 - 3 weeks maximum, handing over of the theocracy over to SA and keeping gulf oil on a standard that involves the US dollar via SDR allocation)."
"It is working - after declining, the Iranians are experiencing issues with inflation again - so much that the leaders have to once again provide their populace with free or subsidized food. If it keeps up, businesses will stagnate and people will not particularly like their leadership. Unfortunately it will do nothing to stop their military or government, since that is paid for by their oil industry."
Anyone who sponsored such a bill would be crucified.

I gotta bad feeling about this....  Han Solo
Hawkish lawmakers. Give some time to the agreement. 
"What action would be taken by the west if the talks were to ""fail""?
More sanctions? Military intervention? 

Would the American people support another war in the middle east? "
"I would think its obvious, but it would be a continuation of the status quo. If they continue with nuclear development, *then* additional sanctions would be applied."
"Maybe if Iran had more competent leaders, shit like this would't have to happen."
"I guess it isn't too difficult to figure out [who bought congress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F-JoW-Rb6E) this time. Let's hope this doesn't turn into another [half million dead children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iraq#Effects_on_the_Iraqi_people_during_sanctions) (I notice that as time goes on, the ""official"" number of children killed by George H. W. Bush's Iraq sanctions is constantly diminishing from the original 1.7 million boasted of by John Ashcroft and complained of by Iraqi officials)."
Fuck US and its allies yet again.
"Australia has just discovered the worlds largest shale oil deposit and will begin extraction and export fairly soon.

Crisis averted."
"Maybe China is attempting to soak up several sources of oil. They buy them cheaper and also this would take them off the market. Meanwhile the demand for the remaining sources of oil rises and therefore so does the price. That makes oil far more expensive for the West.

China wins two ways, cheap oil and a more-stressed West."
Between Africa and Venezuela the China government is taking steps to secure energy resources for the future. No big surprise here. I expect to see them also make deals with India.
prop his regime eh? like the us does with that war criminal state Israel?
"I've been watching this for some time, China has deals with Mexico, Canada and almost all other oil producing countries...We could soon be in a bidding war what we can't win for oil, which is one very good reason to ""move on"" to something other than fossil fuels."
"At this point, lets just all accept that Iran is going to end up with a nuclear weapon. It makes perfect sense for them to have one with Israel and Pakistan in the neighborhood.

I'm just tired of all the idiots around here who believe Iran isn't building a nuke."
And they're right... the whole Iran think is AIPAC propaganda.
"Good for them.

Iran has never attacked anybody and is constantly being threatened by israel.

They need to be able to defend themselves."
"Gosh, they were able to reach an agreement just yesterday, for the same proposal that was tried months ago. Why they don't give it a chance?
I find it most ironical that the ones who want to impose sanctions are the same ones who don't want to get rid of their bombs."
Just your run of the mill globalist trying to ignite war. 
"I imagine Brazil, Turkey, and China would take issue with that statement."
WHAT! Other nations banding together to show that peace can be agreed on! That is even more reason to smoke them out!
... and once again ashamed to be Canadian
"The US Congress is already is in motion for new sanctions on Iran, Australia will fellow and the Western beads will follow to undermine the agreement.

The Israeli machine is already in motion."
