Which Palestinian government will he be recognizing? The one in the West Bank which is about to collapse under the weight of its own corruption or the one in Gaza which is an internationally recognized terror organization?
"This part of the article was a bit odd: ""The Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in the 1967 war."" A large amount of Palestinian politicians, most notably the faction in control of Gaza, do not seek this, and instead seek the establishment of a Palestinian state that takes all lands currently a part of the state of Israel. This is the biggest reason why most major governments don't recognize a sovereign Palestinian state currently. So Corbyn is either severely uninformed or just downright doesn't recognize Israel's sovereignty, either of which are positions that a UK prime minister would probably be ousted for taking."
"Finding a solution for the Syrian Civil War is possible, but what exactly would Jeremy be recognizing when it's a Palestinian state? Gaza Strip run by Hamas or what's left of the West Bank under the PA?"
"I wonder what will happen to Corbyn's idealistic viewpoints when he has to choose between saying Assad should face war crimes and that we should work with Assad to bring about a peaceful end to the Syrian war.

Perhaps he will say we should seek a peace agreement with Assad where he agrees to step down and face prison for war crimes?"

I bet he didn't know there is a difference.

Hamas was elected on a political platform that explicitly called for genocide of jews. Maybe that's what he meant by 'social justice'.
"Source please.

"Hi bud 

I didn't downvote you :-)"
I think it's time to remind you of MI6.
... this guy ...
"Lolol he said in it 2009. Hamas has been a recognized terror group since 1997. 

And even if he didn't keep up with that, he should've remembered the peak thousands of rockets Hamas used to bombard Israeli towns in 2006. 

He also still refuses to talk to Israelis and refuses to take any action on antisemitism against British Jews from his party members and supporters. That apology means zilch when his actions today are still what they are. "
I think it's time to remind you of [whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism)
Hamas *was* two organisations.  You had the terror group and a political wing - similar to the IRA and sinn fein 
"You said Mossad's existence is illegal.

I say, MI6 and Mossad are the exact same thing, only wearing different flags.

How is this whataboutism? "
"Lol. Same way Google US and Google Japan are two different organizations but theyre all one under Alphabet.

Sure, they share the same employees, the same servers, all their data, their money, and report to the same bosses, buuuut just because they took the time to file a few pieces of paperwork, they're totally different organizations /s


Your in denial if youre trying to say that the political wing wasn't fully aware and supportive of the military wing's terrorist activities"
"So you're willing to differentiate the US Armed Forces and the US government as 2 separate bodies with separate goals, agendas, and politics? "
"I didn't say Mossad's existence is illegal. I said that Mossad has broke the law of foreign allied countries and international law, ie. evidence that Israel does not always follow the law.

MI6s existence has no impact on whether or not Israel breaks the law, which is why it is whataboutism. You are trying to diminish something by claiming that it something that others do as well"
If you can't see why groups like hamas and the IRA where less structured than the US military then I would suggest you're being deliberately obtuse. 
"Alright. Then it is whataboutism.

Do you agree then that MI6 breaks the laws of foreign allied countries?"
"I have no idea about the IRA. 

But do explain, how come among 2 governments, the US, and Hamas, only one can claim a complete separation between its political wing and military wing, while the other cannot.

What makes the difference there exactly?"
"Yes of course. To the same extent/frequency, not necessarily sure, but again-- none of this is relevant to my point. "
"Do you serious need me to explain why America,  a nation that has been stable democracy for centuries, employing millions of civil servants is going to find it easier to control it's military than a country's government not recognised by most of the planet, embattled in a 60 year long sectarian conflict, which has next to no resource or authority? 

..."
Yes.
The answer is there in the paragraph. 
Can't find it.
That's because your bias in favour of Israel is blinding you. 
Yes.
Back? He never left
and after all that hard work from the cia. such a shame
He should keep his offer of clemency to anyone who surrenders. It made the U.S. reconstruction so much easier. In fact he said recently that some rebels 'care about their country'
I bet someone somewhere got rich off this conflict. 
"Now Assad starts the retribution killings. The people in Dara and other rebellion strong holds are about to get purged. 

It’s also going to be a tough time for the Kurds who will likely be cleansed by the Turks. 

The war might be over but the death will continue for some time. 

On a good note, Assad will be able to deal with the gangs that have taken over due to the power vacuum. "

"A weakened Syrian government that has no capability to harm Israel within the next 30 years is good enough for Israel/US. In fact, keeping Assad in charge to deal with the Islamists is a better alternative than letting the islamists gain power. People are spinning Assad staying as a win for Russia. Keep in mind that Syria was Russia's top ally in the region before the conflict. A weak Syria that will face an insurgency for years to come puts Russia in a worse position that they were in before 2011.

I thought the news was fake before opening it. I honestly can't believe it. 
"And Turkey, Pakistan is close to them too."
"I don't think it's so much of a middle finger to KSA as much as it is that they're trying not to piss of Iran. Pakistan has good relations with both countries, so by not opposing Assad, they're not actively opposing Iran."
"Thank God. For the longest time, the perception among people in South Asia (and even a lot of Pakistanis) is that Pakistan is, frankly, Saudi's bitch. From the massive terrorist mosques being built by the Saudis to a city renamed after some Saudi despot, I was really losing hope.

But this gives me great hope. Pakistan, Zindabad!"
"Good. Pakistan needs to overthrow the Saudi influence that plagues their country --they even have a city called ""Faisalabad"", named after the Saudi tyrant king Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud."
And to Obama.
"More like Fuck it, I am out!"
"Also a sad reality is that most middle eastern countries are so dysfunctional that a strong dictatorship is usually the only way to keep any nominal type of order and stability.   

Like you mentioned,  democracy takes decades of education to ingrain, and any advance can be unmade in a matter of months.   "
"So many insane statements here. People are actually supporting Assad ? Even Russia is having second thoughts. 

"
"Well, it's pretty much the intent. The idea that powerful countries intervene to ""spread freedom and democracy"" is childish. Remember #1 rules of reality: everyone is an asshole."
"This assumes that democracy of some form is a natural evolution of human progress.  I disagree.  In addition, unlike Africa which is perfectly happy being dysfunctional to it's own people, the Middle East likes to export it's dysfunction to the world.  So do we build walls around them and just hope that one of these dictatorships turns into a functional society somehow?  It is not working out well in Egypt and even outside of Middle East in places like Venezuela and Russia, dictatorships are the norm."
"Except the Arab Spring, for all its failures, have revealed how fragile those dictatorships are. Yes, even in Syria. I would say the civil war and Assad's continued failure has shown the bankruptcy of its repressive institutions. And elsewhere, they've only doubled down on the tools that exposed them in the first place. You can take the hit now or let the problem fester into a bigger problem later on. All this talk of supporting dictatorships because the regime is preferable to the chaos that will follow is basically the geopolitical version of the ugly friend effect.

But leaving them to their own dictators won't work, because they're not likely to ""make the transition on their own,"" because democracy isn't easy, nor is it the natural state of states. Best case scenario, we get more Syrias, a total collapse that draws in its neighbors."
"You sound exactly like US officials who supported all those dictatorships a few decades ago. I'm afraid you're wrong. There is no ""natural"" path from dictatorship  to democracy that doesn't involve throwing out the dictator--dictatorships are the most stable form of government. "

"This was a big part of the recent Democratic debate. Sanders argued your case, that toppling dictators creates power vacuums. Clinton argued that sometimes toppling the dictator is critical for any possibility of stability afterward.

This is one of the few points of contention for the leading Democratic candidates - interventionism in foreign policy. Anyone of any political mind who's interested in the specifics of this issue should watch the remaining Democratic debates, because this tends to come up between Clinton and Sanders in particular."

"The people of Syria were attempting to make the transition on their own, by protesting and demanding change. Assad and his regime responded with force and violence, forcing the people to fight back. It's pretty much exactly what the quote ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable"" means.

It was the relative lack of interference from the rest of the world that allowed the instability to spread, because while the rest of the world was too busy worrying about the sovereignty of an illegitimate government that no longer had the will of the people backing it, foreign extremists were flooding Syria and taking over."

Yeah let me know when countries are a simple closed-system and don't affect the outside world at all.

I think there may be some middle finger involved.

Sure, Pakistan doesn’t want to get caught up in Saudi-Iranian rivalry in Syria. Pakistan has plenty of Shia in their own country. Taking sides might bring the conflict home.

But if that was the reason, there was no need for a public announcement. It doesn’t benefit anyone other than Assad, and Pakistan has no interest in doing him any favors. They could have just sat tight and not said anything. And if Saudi Arabia asked them to contribute soldiers to the war, they could have made their excuses in private. No need to publicly defy them.

I think the reason for the public statement is that Pakistan is unhappy with the 34-nation “coalition” Saudi Arabia announced earlier. They included Pakistan in the coalition without even consulting with Pakistan, without bothering to ask Pakistan if they were willing to join.

Pakistan is pissed that Saudi Arabia is taking them for granted, and this is their payback to tell them: “hey, you don’t own us, we have our own policies which may differ from your interests.”

Of course this is bound to anger Turkey as well to some extent. But on the other hand, meekly joining the Saudis would have angered Iran and any Shia countries, and Pakistan doesn’t want to do that either."

"From what I hear the elections were bullshit Soviet style things and an Assad (first Bashars father then Bashar) has ruled Syria for over 40 years. Also the current civil war started as a backlash to his violent suppression of peaceful protests. 
So unless he declares himself King, dictator sounds accurate.

I'm fairly sure most Syrians who recently lived in Syria hate him. I'm not saying your observation is wrong. He still has some diehard support especially among those who fear terrible slaughter if the opposition wins but possibly the Syrians in your country are mostly from that group and you're not giving you an accurate picture of his popularity."
"Because the word Dictator is a staunce accusation, no leader in the world should be capable of holding more than 70% support as that would mean they are doing something right which the governments who question them are doing wrong. 

Personally I'd say a large factor in this whole revolution is religion, Assads family outlawed religion a long time ago and that led to the first islamist uprising. We are now in the 21st century where opposing parties struggle to exist as the leaders are either islamists or communists from the MB or communist party of old. 

Few people seem to want to oppose Assad without being focused in this area, and I believe the mis-understanding we have is that yes it is easy to run unopposed in the middle east when the Islamist parties the west hates are banned from ruling. . "
"Yet to take the position that different cultures require different forms of political governance undermines significant facets of Liberalism.

"Without knowing what they actually mean by that, saying democracy is the norm isn't necessarily a critique of Putin. Russia is only experiencing democracy for the last 25 years, before that was the USSR, before that was Czarist Russia, where most people didn't live particularly nice lives, and also wasn't a democracy (didn't they only start implementing democratic elements towards the very end of Czarist rule?). Democracy is far from being normal for Russians."

Good thing no outside Western world powers like France meddled in America's independence.  Honestly, I'd be interested in hearing the counter argument:  An example where a dictator was toppled with no foreign interests (military, political or economic) involved at all.  As interconnected as the world has been I have a hard time believing it's happened since the dark ages."
Assad has burned too many bridges with his own people to ever effectively govern again. It would take outside meddling to keep him in power and crush his rivals. Even then the peace wouldn't last. I think the age of having ruthless dictators being able to control these populations is over. It's going to take some keen diplomacy but if we can get Russia and Iran to agree to a post Assad government then this war could end. 
It did for Japan and Germany

So far, Saddam is worse.  One of the greatest ecological, intentional man-made catastrophes of all time was under him.

Please!  The US wants to topple Syria so that it can remove a strategic threat in the Med that is also close to the Suez transit point.  Eliminating the port of Tartus from Russian control prevents Russia from having any sort of resupply point beyond the Black Sea. It also eliminates all rapid response forces to the US bases especially the 5th Fleet HQ near Bahrain and possibly 6th Fleet HQ near Naples. Definitely strengthens the minimal British recon base near Cyprus.

* Invades other countries:
Vietnam, IRaq, Afganistan, libya, syria, pakistan etc (admittedly the last two are not invasions but rather hostile actions without permission to be on their land)

* Uses chemical weapons: 
Agent Orange and nearly all the chemical weapons used in vietnam
Although not exclusively a chemical weapon, white phosphorous in iraq caused extensive burning, damage to civilians and birth defects.
The use of spent uranium rounds, I believe has affected the people of iraq, wherever they were used. 
Although not strictly related, Saddams chemical weapon usage was known and supplied by america, even after the first usage.

A brutal dictator however can be very solid in their place so long as their brutality is only to some and not all. Much like the saudis who use islam as a tool to keep the clerics close and their extensive cofers to pay the public into submission, with no major requirements to work or do anything.

"It was just a statement from Reagan. That's where Marcos realized his legitimacy as president was gone, where it hinged upon his anti-communist drive (the very reason Martial Law took place). The US was not, in any way, directly involved in the snap elections. Besides, the US wanted Marcos in power because of his strong anti-communist policies and the opposition's communist leaning policies. But they didn't thwart the revolution that sparked the regime change.

"Add in pretty much most countries in Central and South America, US has been actively meddling there via direct military force or paramilitary contractors for over 100 years. The US has done some detestable shit in the name of profits for a long time. Syria is no different. 

The overall overt operational goal for Syria is to eliminate the primary threat, Tartus Fleet Supply Port, to the Suez Transit point and possible rapid reaction forces that would be a threat to any US/NATO forces.  Especially since fleet-com HQ for 5th is in Bahrain and 6th is in Naples with a primary British recon facility on Cyprus and Turkish/Israeli assets all being possibly targets for Russian rapid response from Tartus.  Without Tartus, Russia has very minimal capabilities outside of the Black Sea without a direct engagement/breakout effort against Turkish naval/air assets. It would force Russia to rely heavily on long range bombers which can be easily engaged by superior NATO interceptors. "

I never claimed the US had anything to do with killing anyone, only that the US wanted regime change to happen more than they wanted to prevent Islamists from taking over the country.  I am aware that Assad's regime has killed more people than IS, their existence however is a huge threat to western interests.

I'm an isolationist for the most part, but a lot of the weapons ISIS seized were weapons the US provided to an extremely weak military in Iraq.  Considering our failures in Iraq helped create the current situation, I think it's a bit more complicated than it should be.  I think it is in the best interest of the the US to destroy IS anyway possible and stabilize that region.  Easiest way to do this is to support Assad until the job is done then let him hand over rule to someone else.  The only group that can defeat IS in Syria is the Syrian Arab Army, so it's either a foreign invasion or a compromise with Assad.  "

"Two wrongs don't make a right. Saying ""we're better than Hamas"" just proves how low the Israelis set their bar when it comes to human rights bcause they compare themselves to a terrorist organisation. According to Amnesty international, the U.N., and all other human rights associations, Israel is guilty of henious war crimes. Saying that those war crimes can be excused because they are somehow ""better"" than other countries or better than terrorist organisations is quite a ridiculous proposition."

The problem, however, is that even if people in the Pakistani government *genuinely* want to do that, a few Pakistani agencies like the ISI follow a very anti-India policy and have deliberately helped terrorists in the past.

As long as Pakistan doesn't show its commitment towards Indian-specific terrorists within its region, South Asia is probably going to stay as it is right now."

At the very least, certain elements of this institution (and the ISI) continues to support the Afghan Taliban which slaughters thousands of Afghans. So no, you can't pretend the military is an almighty good. It's just as crooked as the government (in fact, I'd say worse).

Cracking on one sect of the Taliban (the TTP) while turning a blind and even supporting other factions does not make your military anti-terrorist heroes."
Of course he was a mass murderIng tyrant. That's why he was in power. Same with Gaddafi.  Same with saddam. No one wants to admit there are times and places in history where mass murdering tyrants are needed because the power vacuums will always be filled. Now we have millions of people fleeing their homeland and stretching resources of other countries. And I entirely blame the American government.  And since no acts of war were passed I put most of the blame squarely on the president.

"You know the world would be a whole lot different if people thought of this as 191,369 people that died instead of 191,369 Syrians who died."
What so this is turning into a dick measuring contest? Let's see which country has had the most deaths in the shortest time frame.
"Isn't it a civil war?  That is Syrians vs. Syrians, of course the death toll for Syrians will be high.  Look up the American civil war.  Duh."
"Reddit couldn't give a shit about Syria, until the US is about to do something with it. Assad's forces have killed tens of thousands and conducted a wide swathe of massacres, and /r/worldnews is still far up his ass because ""ISIS is bad""."
But everyone knows an American life is worth like 500 foreiners
This is also around double the amount of casualties in both sides of any war or conflict ever waged with Israel.
"Article about Israel:

"It's civil war. What did they expect to find? there were over 600,000 deaths in the American civil war. Why not compare it to that?  "
america's war are outside of their countries with relativly few trained soldiers with good equipement involved. And you compare that to a civil war with a bunch of barbaric fanatics murdering innocents.
Fucking hell; between the Syrian Civil War and the Islamic State (which spurned as a result of the chaos in the region) I am frustrated that absolutely nothing is being done here.
The only reason why this article would make a comparison with Americans is because they clearly want American intervention. The hypocrisy of the world makes me sick. Why can't another country do it? 
Why the fuck does everything have to involve America? Keep us out of this. 
"Imagine the level of hypocrisy we feel in Russia, when US openly supported some unknown Bedouin rebels in Syria, fueling current clusterfuck, and then criticize us, Russians for secretly supporting Russians."

>second study by some of the same authors was published in October, 2006, in The Lancet.[2][25][26]
We estimate that between March 18, 2003, and June, 2006, an additional 654,965 (392,979–942,636) Iraqis have died above what would have been expected on the basis of the pre-invasion crude mortality rate as a consequence of the coalition invasion. Of these deaths, we estimate that 601,027 (426,369–793,663) were due to violence.""[2] 

>A September 14, 2007, estimate by Opinion Research Business (ORB), an independent British polling agency, suggests that the total Iraqi violent death toll due to the Iraq War since the U.S.-led invasion is in excess of 1.2 million (1,220,580). Although higher than the 2006 Lancet estimate through June 2006, these results, which were based on a survey of 1,499 adults in Iraq from August 12–19, 2007, are more or less consistent with the figures that were published in the Lancet study.[27][>"
"Well, that is certainly encouraging."
Thank Samantha Power.
Now that is some population control in a really messed up way.
"The course of war still has in its path:

[following how its going now]

They lose ground in iraq and gain ground in Syria, ISIS retreats from Iraq(in the circumstance that they are losing there) and the terrorists regroup in Syria.

1. Destruction of ISIS from Syria(add civilian, FSA, military, foreign deaths)
2. Destruction of either the government's institutions and power or all the rebel factions(lets point to the direction of Assad losing power).
3. Possible Russian intervention to save Assad's regime from collapsing.
4. Possible NATO intervention to topple Assad's regime
5. Gang-violences and factions fighting with each other for power
6. Separation of Syria
7. Violence before/during/after(till stability) of Syria.

That is one long journey and I won't be surprised if the death toll surpasses 1 million."
I still remember Hillary Clinton saying the war would be over in 48 hours.
"Has anyone here watched any UN human rights council meetings?

Looking at a list of its past and present members will give you an idea. "
Just like the PNAC documented wanted.
"foreign mercenaries != civil war.

With two very close friends from Syria who came here less than two years ago to get away from the war I would like to say Pray For Syria and the innocent people being killed in this war. No child deserves to grow up in that. 
Their problem.
Good thing the UN knows how to do studies!
Arming the rebels seems to have been worth it.
I'm sorry but if this is supposed to make americans care well... Have we all forgotten about great battles like the battle of stalingrad in which millions became casualties just trying to capture or defend this one city? 
Dense urban area.  Both parties willing to kill anyone.  People conditioned to accept dictatorship and religious dogmatic absolutism.  What do you think it's going to happen?  This it's not US problem.  Muddled eastern countries need to figure this out.  If we get involved then Russian needs to get involved as well.  US and EU are not enough.
And like 80% of them are inoocents. so sad
Civil wars are like that.
"Civil Wars are particularly gruesome and hard to heal. 

Here in the U.S. the war resulted ""in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties. One estimate of the death toll is that ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40 perished."" That doesn't include civilian casualties. The total U.S population taken in the 1860 census was 31,443,321

In 2012 there were 22 million Syrians and this article infers almost 200,000 deaths. It goes to show you just how horrifying the U.S. civil war was and just how horrifying Syria has become.

The Soviets lost at least 20 million out of 190 million to the Nazis.

The Mongols killed 70 million. 

Islam has killed 100's of millions with 80 million in India alone.

I wonder when Kerry or McCain will use this as an argument for sending troops in.
We need to write some more strongly worded letters. 
"What a weird situation to compare to Mr/Miss-journalist. Battle of Stalingrad, Verdun, The Somme would have been better."

"Recent wars tend to be a lost worse from a financial perspective than from loss of life. The U.S. only lost the lives of 5,000 military volunteers but cost over 6 Trillion Dollars, a fucking stunning amount of money that could have bought every American healthcare and a college education for decades.

But hey, at least that 6 Trillion in military spending stimulated our economy, right Keynesians? Right?"
"Stupid comparison, but the lack of action for the west here in supporting the moderates has led to civilians caught between a brutal dictator who is hanging on and a bunch of psychopathic Islamists. 

I see a lot of people criticising the west for the state that Libya is in, and it is in a shit state, but it is immeasurably better than the situation in Syria."
I know it's a terrible situation over there but what am I supposed to do about it? It sucks and i hope it ends soon but the title acts like I'm capable of stopping it.
"Before the fighting in Syria started one side has weapons the other side not. There was no fighting. The side with weapons was not commiting genocide but the people without the weapons (motivated by what they heard of the Arab spring) wanted a better life. Then some country we are not going to name came with the money and the weapons. Then the fighting started, families got ripped apart and more people wanted to fight. Now nobody has a good life anymore and the side that originally did not have weapons is comiting genocide in Syria AND other countries. I say we take out Assad and Iran, clearly this is ALL THERE FAULT."
I can't believe America foots more than half the bill for that retarded UN just to have them publish garbage like this. Is this what our money goes towards? 
"How does the punch line go?

"Why SHOULD anyone in the US care? It's not our fucking problem! Are the people there begging for our help? Is the syrian government asking our government for aid? No, the answer is no, they aren't and they don't want it."

The author is probably just trying to help the average reader put these numbers in perspective. The American Civil war ended 150 years ago and not many Americans remember it (no shit Sherlock) but a lot of them surely remember the more recent conflicts and all the suffering they brought and that should really help them understand just how brutal this war in Syria is.
"612,220 is a low estimate as well, there are new studies that point that the actual number is something in the ballpark of 1-2 million."
Not to mention that was at a time when the US population was TEN PERCENT OF WHAT IT IS NOW.
"Its always somehow our problem, until we actually do get involved then suddenly were war junkies who cant ""stop policing the world"".

We get involved were scolded.  We dont get involved, we're still scolded.

Don't forget our much smaller population at the time.
"And 2 million people died in 8 months during the battle of Stalingrad. That's 250.000 people per month on average per month, 62.500 per week, and about **9.000** people per **day**. 
What's your point?"
"Thank you for your rational input. But you also don't factor in how many civilians and ""enemy combatants"" (people either way) died in wars or from wars the USA was engaged in."
Because they're trying to goad you into war.

1. Minimize the loss of American lives in WW2 

2. Make it more relavent to Americans. "
Then there's Viet Nam...
Article has an agenda.
Yeah it's a poor emphasis 
"It is kind of odd that they'd do that... Compare 3 years of someone's war to the US who hasn't had 3 years of war. It's like saying Syria had more deaths in the current war than Canada had since their last war. If we also had 3 years of war, it would sort of make sense to be a comparison. Otherwise, they're just trying to get an audience."
"""BREAKING NEWS: More people have died in Iraq the past decade than the collective amount of silver medals given out at every summer olympics since 1932!"""

This is a Civil war where you're fighting for your home. Civil Wars are always the most desperate, bloody, and dangerous. I see no reason why this is at all surprising. When you fight a war on your ground, you don't have an option to retreat. "
"It's simple, the writer has an agenda where they want the US to get involved in the conflict. The writer now has you thinking about Syria and the US and all those civilians that are being killed. Never mind the fact that if the US got involved twice as many would die. Writer probably is being paid by some company in the US defense industry."
"Because there is a big push *again* to get America to go take down Assad and build a new nation there. I mean, just look at how many Syrians are dying! Aren't we being a bit selfish in our refusal to put our American soldiers at risk to stop all the bloodshed in Syria? Never mind that American involvement in that war will just add to the deaths exponentially. Never mind that our track record for creating stable states in the region is now like 0/5. Oh, and Islamic State."
"The whole Arab-Israeli conflict including several full blown wars has around 100,000 dead total. That's less than the war in Syria. It is far less than the Iraq mess (500,000 to 1,000,000)."
hahahahaha excellent.
"Why don't we compare the number the number of sanctions placed on Syria vs Israel.

"When was the last time Obama threatened to bomb Israel if they didn't turn over their chemical weapons? Nice try, but the world is still harder on Syria. Where do you think much of the money and weapons used to fight the regime is coming from."
"Yeah, because the US/EU have sanctions on Israel, forced them to give up their chemical weapons, armed and funded Palestinian militants to bring down the Netanyahu government, and threatened to bomb Israel numerous times? Yep, poor Israel, they get so much shit from everyone. What a joke."

What and have Russia run a monopoly on the weapon market in the region?
"Because warfare is not the same. Those death were soldiers fighting eachother in those big formal battles. Fortunatelly , USA never experienced the nasty side of war , you know , the one with destroyed towns and total ruin and civilian deaths in the hundreds of thousands."
"You have to remember that in the US, irony is an extremely popular means of communication"
"It's pretty much impossible to say how many people died in Iraq, due to the fact that there is no reliable independent tracking source; there were about 7 different wars going on at once so it's impossible to say who killed who, when, and how; and because the numbers are highly politicised therefore various groups have reasons to inflate or deflate the numbers. 

But usually it's considered to be between 100,000-600,000 which is a pretty major gap. So make of that what you will."
"The highest estimate was 600,000 killed total but most put the estimate at around 100-150,000. And the vast majority were not killed by Americans but by warring factions when the Shiite-Sunni sectarian fighting started

So no, not even close"

Do you think the US should world police Syria?
"It isn't our problem, and despite how desperately you wish the world was really the way you see it through your rose colored glasses, it isn't and never will be. People's lives have differing values and no one really gives a shit about people in the middle east, the entire region basically plays no role in our day to day lives outside of a place to test weapons on and wage geo-political war. The people there are simply pawns in a large game of chess. The only reason we like to think that everyone's life is valuable is because it makes us feel better but the reality is that life is disposable and likely always will be. So it's much better if you don't dwell on it and try to achieve as much wealth as you can so your family doesn't get stuck being on the bottom. And yeah that's a very cynical/depressing way to look at it, but it's the reality. No one gives a shit about a goat farmer in the middle east them existing or not existing won't play a role in how we live our lives, until he picks up a gun and kills an American or drives a plane into something or blows something up. And that is the way we look at it. So any moment of time they spend fighting each other is more time they aren't planning another terrorist attack or shooting at american soldiers. And maybe we can actually get people that support us in power when it's all over making it a win win. And maybe that's a shitty way to look at this conflict but I'm sure that given the chance many of them would want to kill us so I don't really give a shit if they are dieing in a war they decided that they want to fight. It's not our problem."

Although higher than the 2006 Lancet estimate through June 2006, these results, which were based on a survey of 1,499 adults in Iraq from August 12–19, 2007, are more or less consistent with the figures that were published in the Lancet study.[27][>

Even those two events are way less than 80 million. They may be referencing sectarian violence over the course of hundreds of years as well as different kingdoms fighting each-other. 
"I cant find a full and complete list of deaths, but Islam has been involved in hundreds of wars across the world. Does this make it unique in terms of religion? No, but it certainly isn't innocent. Just off the top of my head theres the conquests of the Timur empire, The ottomans in the Balkans and Armenia. Muhammad's campaigns when Islam was first starting. There was the invasion of spain which lasted hundreds of years, the Umayyad Caliphate, the invasions of india which while we don't know how many were killed or enslaved we know the numbers are very high. The Barbary pirates, Greek Genocide, and so many more. Sure it isn't unique to islam, but lets not pretend that millions haven't died because of it.  "

The only reasonable explanation of what happened to it is that nearly all of it was stolen by corrupt military contractors."
"Couple of Points:

No McCain never met with ISIS he met with Northern Storm brigade - the idea that the guy circled in the picture is Abu Bakr alBaghdadi is a hilarious joke that got spread after the Occupy Wall Street facebook page shared it.
The guy is an Asifat alShamal officer who got killed by ISIS later apparently... He only vaguely looks like Baghdadi because of his goatee mirroring Baghdadi's 2003 prison mugshot - this guy is some 20 years younger too. The group pictured with McCain actually got assaulted and massacred by ISIS in November 2013 for the meeting, they called the group ""McCain's dogs"". Its very ironic to claim McCain met ISIS when the group he was actually meeting were the most Anti-Islamist secular FSA group in northern Syria and got massacred by ISIS.

Also Abdellah alBashir, new (official) leader of the SMC, is a ""moderate Islamist""? Since when? Not only that - FSA has no leader, Abdellah alBashir has no authority and SMC is bypassed completely - its merely a legal representative. Even US aid completely bypasses SMC now and goes straight to more organised and less corrupt FSA individual groups.

Also, Syrian rebels didnt ""appoint"" Abdellah alBashir as the article claims - He was appointed by the political opposition SNC where the previous commander Salim Idriss was sacked - FSA groups opposed the move and stood with Idriss until a compromise was reached."
"You could say that about any number of crisis' in the world.  We can exhaust ourselves pursuing justice, and never accomplish that goal.  As far as I can see, unless we have an identifiable threat, and a realistic way to ameliorate that threat, we are just wasting our time and effort in trying to save the world.

If I have succumbed to compassion fatigue, blame Bush Jr., and the last two stupid wars that have drained our treasury and killed our young people.  If it's that important to stop Assad, let someone else step up and do the job."

And proportionally the US still lost more than Syria has so far.
"I think the main reason for that is there are far fewer fights between two great powers.

In the third and developing world, you still see direct engagements in war frequently. When you have two roughly equal powers, you get war stagnation, when you have war stagnation, you get desperation, and when that happens you get both sides throwing troops at each other like its WW1 (see Iran Iraq War).

In Korea the US went up against hordes of Chinese in a brutal slug match for a full year and a half. 

We haven't had to face an enemy that could take everything we throw at them in open battle, and then hit back since.

We haven't had to face an army of hundreds of thousands that didn't run in fear and surrender after only a few days/weeks of fighting us since.

In short, modern war is almost war-light for first world powers. Especially the US.

If we ever go up against a significant power again, one that has legit anti air defenses, good tanks of their own, and well disciplined soldiers (or at least a huge supply of soldiers), then we will see a return to many, many tactics last used in the world wars and Korea. At least for a few months. Currently there is no nation on earth that could last against a sustained campaign by the US, but there are some that could hold for at least a while.

They only ""unified"" into European style states, which were drawn by Europeans, after WWI. Which is also the reason why the only semi-successful ones have had extremely authoritarian governments."

Like the other day I learned about Benedict Arnold because they kept mentioning him in some goddamn movie or something. 

EDIT: now I think about it, Benedict Arnold was the American Revolution, wasn't it?"
Funny enough we learnt it in Modern History Class in high school as an elective subject. Granted it was just one amongst many optional topics our teacher chose and not a popular one too.

"If only we used special rules to limit a conflict, we would kick ass! There aren't any wars like you describe unless the US goes looking for them. The major powers have nukes. The minor powers will do whatever they can to avoid war with the US. Iraq and afghanistan were 100% by choice, they weten't wars of necessity. 
The US can win any battle against anyone, but we have idiots choosing the battles. So you end up fighting for 10 years without accomplishing a damn thing."

"Vox is run by Ezra Klein and Matt Yglesias.  You probably couldn't find more liberal or anti-war journalists/columnists in the mainstream media if you tried. Their work regularly appears on DailyKos and ThinkProgress. They aren't trying to trick anyone in the US into supporting a war in Syria.



[Ezra Klein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Klein#Career)
>Klein formerly wrote for and edited Wonkblog at the Washington Post, which now features five writers in addition to Klein.[citation needed] He frequently provides political commentary on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, Hardball with Chris Matthews, and The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. He is a former contributor to Countdown with Keith Olbermann. On March 14, 2013, The Week magazine reported that Klein was among those being considered to host MSNBC's yet-unnamed 8 p.m. weekday prime-time show that would replace The Ed Show.[13] Ultimately, the time slot was filled with All In with Chris Hayes.[citation needed]

>In May 2011 when Bloomberg View launched, Klein became a columnist there in addition to his work at The Washington Post and MSNBC.[14]

>Klein started his first blog in February 2003.[15][non-primary source needed] He soon[when?] joined with Matt Singer, and the name was changed to ""Klein/Singer: Political Consulting on the Cheap"". In June 2003, he moved to the blog ""Not Geniuses"" along with Matt Singer, Ryan J. Davis, and Joe Rospars.[16][non-primary source needed] Following ""Not Geniuses,"" Klein partnered with Jesse Taylor at Pandagon.[when?] This partnership helped Klein gain even more visibility, leading to his eventual founding[when?] of his blog ""Ezra Klein"".[17]

>Besides his online contributions, Klein worked on Howard Dean's primary campaign in Vermont in 2003, and interned for the Washington Monthly in Washington, D.C. in 2004. ""The media is as effective and important an agent for change as the legislative bodies, and I think it's where I'm happiest and most effective,"" Klein said.[18] In 2003, he and Markos Moulitsas were two of the earliest bloggers to report from a political convention, that of the California State Democratic Party.[19] In 2006, Klein was one of several writers pseudonymously flamed by The New Republic writer Lee Siegel (posting as a sock puppet called sprezzatura).[20]

>On December 10, 2007, Klein moved his blog full-time to the American Prospect.[21]




[Matt Yglesias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Yglesias)
>Yglesias started blogging in early 2002, while still in college, focusing mainly on American politics and public policy issues, often approached from an abstract, philosophical perspective. He was one of the supporters of the Iraq war.[citation needed] Yglesias joined the American Prospect as a writing fellow upon his graduation in 2003, subsequently becoming a staff writer. His posts appeared regularly on the magazine's collaborative weblog TAPPED.[2] His personal blog has been hosted, at various times, on Blogger, Typepad, Josh Marshall's TPMCafe, and at matthewyglesias.com. From June 2007 until August 2008, he was a staff writer at The Atlantic Monthly, and his blog was hosted on the magazine's website, The Atlantic. In July 2008, he announced that he would leave The Atlantic Monthly for the Center for American Progress where he wrote for its blog, ThinkProgress, because he missed ""the sense of collegiality that comes from working with like-minded colleagues on a shared enterprise"" and thought he could ""help advance their mission"".[3] On November 21, 2011, he left ThinkProgress to work as a business and economics correspondent at Slate's Moneybox.[4][5] He does not have a formal degree in economics.[6]"
"You want to compare the Syrian civil war to the Syrian civil war? Because that's what this was, a comparison. To put things in perspective for the readers."
the point of the article was a comparison of deaths from one war to others. I don't see how I'm doing anything different. Other than the fact that I thought well enough to pick a war with more casualties in the same amount of time. I'm not trying to diminish the suffering of the Syrian people I'm merely pointing out the articles obvious cherry picking of facts to sensationalize their story.
"You realize that the civil war trashed pretty much the entire southern half of the US (an area several times larger than Syria), and that we lost over 600,000 men at a time when the US population was TEN PERCENT OF WHAT IT IS NOW right?"
I think you have a fatal misunderstanding of how devastating the US civil war actually was.
"The US didn't start it, but continues to fuel it."
"No, actually I was being serious. There's a difference between *starting* something and choosing sides after the fact. In fact, the U.S. didn't start any of those conflicts. They arose of their own accord, and the U.S. chose sides - most often to our detriment and to those whom we were attempting to ""help."""
Did the Americans kill the dinosaurs too? 
"I don't know why you're getting down voted, either way it was a US, Israeli and Gulf Arab plot, anyone denying this is beyond ignorant and a slave to the prostitutes which brainwash the world with false info."
"Civil wars are always fucking ugly.  But if you offer people a choice between death, submission, and war, you can expect the third sooner or later.

Don't take this as an endorsement of US foreign policy.  I think their government is a gigantic bag of dicks at best.  There's an ocean of blood on those hands.  I'm just not going to use or accept their inept attempts at realpolitik as a justificaton for the likes of Assad."
"I don't think armaments really matter. The Arabs were always well armed as well. Sometimes even better armed than the Israelis. If I remember correctly the Israelis were still using WWII style tanks during the Six Day War while the Arabs had plenty of Soviet made tanks. Sure the Israelis had their own industry uparmouring and improving those tanks. But still. Before the Yom Kippur war the Arabs bought every fancy Soviet equipment they could get their hands on, while Israel was actually partially under arms embargo and even had to steal ships they had bought from France.

This article talks in great details about the issues of Arab armies:
http://www.meforum.org/441/why-arabs-lose-wars"
None actually. Just the ever powerful UN condemnation. 
"Does it not bother you that the UNHRC mandatory topic in every session is Israel while the ""largest humanitarian crisis of our era"" is going on for years now ?

Or the fact that 47% of all resolutions and condemnations issued by the UNHRC since its founding are about Israel, and they are initiated and voted on by countries that are infamous human rights violators ?

Lets say hypotheticaly that Israel does commit warcrimes - does it deserve to be the hot topic of the UNHRC when crysises several orders of magnitude more serious are going on in the world ?"
I'm talking about troops
"Oooh, he brought out the wikipedia article! Hide guys!"
Are you fucking joking? We helped the Taliban fight the Russians off in the 80s and then they flew fucking planes into our buildings. Fuck them.
I'm completely open for discussion. At the moment though I'm of the opinion the US should learn from it's mistakes and stay out of middle eastern civil wars
"Fun fact the Americans were trying to create [Bat bombs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_bomb) before the atomic bomb where bats equiped with small caninisters with napalm in it were released above a city so that they would nest and then burn down the city.

Basicly another way to fire bomb a city."
"When talking about the modern UN-recognised sovereign boundaries of the state of Syria, they legally count as foreigners."
"We're not talking about Netenyahu. It's irrelevant here. You bringing it up is sad whataboutery to deflect from Assad.

And more people have died in Syria in the last 14 months then Israel has killed in its entire history. So double worthless comparison."
"The North had a policy of raping any women in New Orleans they felt. Sherman's march burned all farmland and razed all buildings in a 20 mile wide stretch until they reached Atlanta, which they burned.

Just two examples that I know of."
It was rarely done in the name of religion 
Just about 0. That's how many Christianity killed in WWII. WWII was all about race and nationalism.
"Ok go look up the muslim sources. Or a non-rightwing source

Regarding FSA decentralisation, the degree to which SMC has been completely bypassed is a more recent phenomena. Actually its more of an argument to be involved, because the new FSA coalition formations that have risen to bypass the SMC are far more organised, efficient, less corrupt, and more effective at unifying FSA groups, which is why Western nations are entrusting aid directly to them.

"So why does this article exist? 

- Pam"
What does that have to do with anything? The US was the one mentioned int he title for comparison. Not Russia.
I dont see why you are being downvoted you have a point that trying to *say the US lost so much during the civil war compared to Syria isn't right when you compare other larger conflicts that have happened but the article needs that type of spin on the study to try and attract american views
"He has a point. Syria is a tragedy and deserves more recognition than it has been getting, but in WWII the Soviet Union lost an estimated 50 million people. Civilian and military. 

In terms of percentage of the population:

Soviet Union WWII-25.42% (50 million / 196,700,000)

USA Civil War-2.42% (750,000 / 31 million)

Syria-.96% (191369 / 20 million in 2010)

Syria is a tragedy, but there have been worse. Not many in recent memory, however. 

EDIT: Some people are having issues with my Russia/Soviet Union numbers.

1. I screwed up on the population numbers. During WWII the Soviet Union, not just Russia, fought Germany (and for a short time Japan). Their population number approximately 196,700,000 when you combine all the territories that were a part of the Soviet Union at the time. I quickly searched and found the 2.3 billion number, and have since corrected my number to 196,700,000 ([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties#USSR)).

2. The exact losses Soviet losses in WWII are unknown. Most Russian sources immediately after the war posted a number around 25 million. Recent research in Russia has put that number closer to the 50 million mark ([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties#USSR)). The truth is we will never know the exact total with any degree of certainty. "
I never said that.
That straw man.
"Against a total war mode USA? No there isn't. 

Remember World War Two? When we were willing to burn whole cities to ash with tens of thousands of civilians just to shut down factories? When we drafted over sixteen million men? When we produced more military aircraft THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED? Over 60,000 tanks (thousands more than anyone else), 10 battleships, 27 aircraft carriers, over 200 submarines, and over 1000 military support vessels? 

When the US military industrial engine gets going, it morphs into a freight train that is utterly unstoppable. We haven't even had to come close to that level in any conflict since, and the thing is, we didn't even peak during WW2. We were still ramping up all the way until the war ended. In 200 years, not since 1812 have we faced an enemy that could truly test us."
Are you kidding? Liberals have turned into war hawks since Obama was elected. 
"This entire thread is like an Abbot and Costello routine.  I'm repeating my message that we should drop this topic and focus on the actual Syrian conflict.  Talk about relief efforts, talk about the politics or the causes.  Arguing on Reddit with anyone about what is the most relevant comparison is a waste of time.  I notice I'm being downvoted a bit over this line of reasoning, and I'm open to changing my view..."
"Thats a solid point.  I thought that the article was really just using a frame of reference american's might immediately get, and it was in fact about syria.  Not the comparison.  I understand what you're saying though."
It was still more symmetrical in military strength than the war being fought in Syria.
"If you're an American, how devastated do you feel by the Civil War? "
"hahahahahahha now that my friend is just hilarious, from feeding arms munitions and funds to the Afghans, to supporting al-queda, regime changes in Libya, Iraq and Iran.. to  saddam and gadaffi and destroy Syria, the three countries holding the middle east in check.. to covert payments and interference in Ukraines politics.. hahahahahahahahaha of course the US has nothing to do with it.."
Yes

Our world is controlled by prostitutes now? That's a new one.
"You have to look at the whole of the middle east not just Syria.. despots have a place, they have a purpose, and in the middle east they are a requirement. ""democracy"" especially the US kind doesn't work, it cannot work.. not in the middle east."
What condemnation are you talking about? AFIK UN is unable to condemn Israel because of the US veto.
"There is action on Syria: sanctions, humanitarian assistance, funding/arming of rebels, pariah status for the Assad regime, removal of WMD, and so on. There is NO action on Israel. This is a country that is literally in the process of destroying an entire people, whilst passing itself off as a liberal democracy.

Does it not bother you that the U.S. has used it’s veto power to shield Israel from accountability over 40 times since 1972? That the only other time the U.S. used it’s veto power so rigorously was in defending apartheid South Africa? I’m sure they felt like they were being unfairly targeted to.

Israel can complain about “disproportionate” criticism when they start rejecting “disproportionate” foreign aid and “disproportionate” U.S. diplomatic cover.
"
"Ha! You showed him! Shooting down his relevant comment by making fun of it. Fuck any arguments against US covert operations funding in Ukraine and Syria before wars happened in those countries, it's never our governments fault. Putin and Assad = bad guys.

"Didn't Al Qaeda blow up the WTC? Anyway, the Taliban are our enemies because they're a bunch of extremist cunts who kill children. They don't hate us because we gave them weapons to fight off the Russians. They just hate us.

"Err, it was saudis who took the two week ""learn to fly a commercial airliner"" course. The taliban had about as much to do with it as germany."
"I don't think it's right to paint all conflicts in the middle east with the same brush. Iraq was a huge, devastating mistake, but the intervention in Libya was the right thing to do, as is supplying arms to secular rebels in Syria. I don't think we should invade. Syria would be an even more unwinnable war than Iraq was. I think we should have set up a no fly zone over Homs and Hama, at the beginning of the crisis, to prevent Assad from carrying out his threats and slaughtering thousands of innocent protesters. At that point it wasn't a civil war, it was a slaughter, just like Libya. People like to forget how this whole thing started, and how our inaction early in the crisis allowed Assad to gain the upper ground and eventually muddy the water so much that it's now impossible to say which side is the lesser evil."
"Why cant he bring israel into the discussion? What is happening in syria,  is an israeli wet dream. You would be naive to think that the west had nothing to do with it,  israel included. "

"I was not aware of such things...thanks.
I guess it seems that it matters little what country the war is taking place in , when military leaders get in charge of things , looting , rape and destruction become common place .
Sad really."
yes a better comparison would be how many did Christians kill during the crusades and then it would be relative to be of any meaning so you would need percentages.
"Out of curiosity, how many people did die during the crusades?"
I responded to your arguments already. You must not have even read my comment. 
You are vastly misinformed
"I'm just confused as to what you specifically disagree with, and if you plan on providing a counter example"
"You talked about three things: post-war population growth, post-war ""deaths of 1 million blacks"" (not sure exactly what you're referring to here),  and lastly the effects of the war on the... environment?

I'm going to hold off on the second thing because I have no idea where you're getting that number from or to what you're attributing it.

The other two don't appear to have much, if anything, to do with post-war feelings."
"Makes me nervous after my government supported jihadists in Afghanistan which birthed in part Al-Qaeda to imagine us giving arms to a decentralized fighting force where generals have already left and joined ISIS.

Because.
"Because the rest of the world are men that wear panties. Possibly the one that currently runs the US also.

Heck, it even took FDR 5 years to step in and do something when Hitler started slaughtering Jews. Even then it took the Japanese to get us into the conflict."
Will you be giving the shit that you took?
"Gross, what will you do with it?"
"Americans don't give a shit. But Samantha Power does. And she is running American foreign policy. American foreign policy is: use twitter and briefcases full of cash to stage protests against dictators and have that steamroll into a full revolution. When the dictator uses force against the revolutionaries, denounce him for violating human rights and remove him from power through any means. This is all there is to it. If you're a dictator that is anti-democracy and violates western notions of human rights, then we wreck your entire nation to get you out of power. Ask Libya how great the Power doctrine is working for them. But its all irrelevant to Power, because the goal isn't about minimizing casualties or improving lives, it is entirely about getting Assad. 

So, Americans don't give a shit. But Samantha Power does. And she won't stop until Americans DO give a shit. No matter what crazy scenarios or false flags or youtube videos they have to put out, they are going to convince Americans to go take down Assad."
"Because assad is the target, not ISIS. The whole point of ISIS is to lure us into Syria to fight Assad for them. Once we are in Syria, ISIS dissolves and they all rejoin the 'good' rebels again. Then we put them in charge after Assad is gone."
So you could give a fuck? 
"Yeah, I fully expect you and all the other dumbfuck Americans to fully support *BOMBING FUCK FUCK BOMBING* whatever the media convinces you to bomb. You say that 'oh religious extremist assholes that behead anyone' ought to be bombed. But you have to know that bombing the assholes is going to end up killing a lot of innocent civilians as well. I mean you are just so fucking stupid. You act like you support justice bombing the 'assholes' but you're just going to kill more people. Bombs don't have 'evil sensors' on them. They do not discriminate. 

ISIS has taken over lots of villages. You bomb them, you are going to kill some 'assholes' and you're going to kill some innocents. If you want to 'annihilate' ISIS, you are going to end up killing a lot more innocents than ISIS ever did.

But none of this will get through to you, because you are just so fucking helplessly stupid. All you see is ""RELIGIOUS DIRTY DOUBLE MUSLIM BLOW IT UP"". All you are is hate and stupidity.

You are arguing about what the most relevant comparison is with people on Reddit.
"Not really... Right now its still murky on who has the upper hand in some parts of the country. Meanwhile you realize the entire second half of the US Civil War was the north beating the south to a pulp right?

The Union had more than twice as many men, they were better supplied and armed, they had control of the sea, and, in Shermans case, were able to rampage around completely unchecked by southern forces.

The only reason it took two years after Gettysburg to end the war was because it was the 19th century and travel times were longer."

"lol no they were training and meeting in Afghanistan prior to even coming to the US and it was orchestrated by Bin Laden who was leading Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.

"Obviously the Syrian people do not deserve what is happening but NATO intervention in Libya along the lines of what you are suggesting has not lead to lasting peace in that country.

Suppose the West intervened with air strikes, or even direct military action, what would happen when we left? The same exact scenario, a proxy war between the two regional powers, Iran and Saudi Arabia, for the future of Syria. Could have been the exact same outcome, only with us incurring extra costs.

It's disappointing to see the lack of compassion in the comments, but that doesn't mean we made the wrong call by not intervening. The conflict fault lines are deep within the history and culture of the Middle East and not something we could resolve by a few targeted strikes. Almost a decade in Iraq and trillions of dollars did very little to ""fix"" the sectarian rifts in that country."

The main reason they won against Germany was because they had a bigger pot to take out of than the Germans. The Soviets were basically scraping the bottom of the pot, like Germany, but for every 2 Germans there were about 5 Soviets. Quantity, weather and time was on their side after the disaster of Stalingrad."

No really. Its more like all the other countries that ""rival us"" learned from China in Korea that if you go up against the US directly in a proxy war, we're going to make you march over mountains of your own dead, and if you try to overwhelm our superior tech with numbers we will just bath them in napalm until they quit screaming.

The Chinese lost 6+ men for every American soldier they killed. They were so scared of us by the end of the war that thousands defected rather than fight anymore.

> And the funny thing is, the farm boys win. 

Not in battles they don't.

As far as overall conflict go? Yeah, sure they ""win"" sometimes. But do you know why? Because we're nice.

We could make what the Mongols did to the ME look like a favor. We could turn the whole place into a wasteland. The Mongols did it with horse archers. We have Tomahawk missiles and guns.

Do you know why we don't do that though? Partly because were not genocidal maniacs, and also because were not interested in building an empire. Our economy is not based on constant land expansion. We don't care if Muhammad takes back his patch of dirt after we leave, because we never wanted his patch of dirt in the first place. 

We are in the business of building allies. Not an empire. Do you know why? Because Empires over extend themselves. They collapse under their own weight. The US could easily go the empire rout, and be successful for a very long time like Rome was. But we know what inevitably happens to empires. We never over extend ourselves, we have stayed the same size for decades now despite fighting a multitude of wars. No one but us would classify that as good, but it actually is. It means we never fight on our own turf, and we never lose turf or really anything for that matter. Sometimes these efforts are successful (West Germany, South Korea, Japan, etc...), and sometimes they are not (South Vietnam, Iraq, etc...), but the times that are successful outweigh the failures. America has only gotten stronger over the years. Not weaker. We just fought two simultaneous conflicts and during them neither you nor I had to get ration cards for sugar or milk. We could still buy silk, steel, and anything else we wanted. THATS NUTS. Seriously. I don't think you realize how much horse power that shows the US economy has.

If some idiot tries to attack the US, they have to keep in mind the fact that for everyone of us they kill, they are likely going to lose 100+ in response.

The world lives in Pax Americana."
"The picture you posted...uh...what are you trying to prove by using that picture? Also, you act as if the US can go around picking fights with other first-world countries or nations like China or Russia, both of which have nuclear weapons.

"They trained all over the world, including the US. Yes, they found refuge in a backwards backwater, because they had money, and the taliban probably didnt think of them as a huge problem since al qaeda was their US approved and funded ally when fighting the soviet union. The taliban probably would have  taken US aid in exchange for ditching al qaeda, as they often quarreled.  We will see what happens when the US finally leaves afghanistan and the current government collapses."
"I should clarify, I don't think we should intervene now - or at least, I have nowhere near the level of knowledge about the complex situation to say so. As I see it, the situation has devolved into the chaos it is in now because there was no prompt action from the international community. I think, that before this became a civil war, we had the opportunity to prevent it escalating. I'm not talking about regime change. If we had just prevented the butchery of the protesters, through UN action or military intervention, there wouldn't have been a war. The government probably wouldn't have collapsed, either. It would have been a stalemate, and instead of Jihadi thugs having the loudest voice, the pro-democracy movement would have had centre stage. Instead, we fumbled around and couldn't even muster any strong condemnation from the UN owing to the self-interest of Russia and the Chinese. This allowed Assad to continue to ramp up his use of force until the only thing we *could* do was to arm the rebels, so as to prevent another massacre on the scale of Hama. Now we have the worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century and a conflict which still threatens to engulf the region in chaos. 

People like to say that's our fault, but I believe that people have the right to defend themselves from brutal murderers like Assad. I also think that when people stand up, at risk of their lives, to demand the freedoms we enjoy in peace, we cannot simply turn our backs on them. To do so is not only a monstrous betrayal of our heritage, but it also chips away at the worth of our own freedoms. "
"Libya is in the middle of turmoil that always comes with a violent revolution. It makes me so angry when people suggest that we should have just turned our back on the civilians of Benghazi when Gaddafi had the city surrounded and was threatening to 'crush them like rats.'

Of course the US cares who they're arming. They don't want to arm their future enemies. As to how they would know; I assume it has something to do with the hundreds of CIA operatives reportedly operating in Syria and the secret bases teaching them to operate heavy weaponry. This isn't 1850, you don't need a spyglass and signalling lantern to talk to your buddies over the hill."

Religion spreads for many reasons. Sometimes people are forced to convert or die. Sometimes missionaries give aid and engender support from the populace. Sometimes muslims impose a special tax on non-muslims, giving an incentive to switch religions. Sometimes superior armies and more advanced civilisation make people think that their religion is superior. There are a whole lot of ways that religions spread and other religions decline. There is no evidence whatsoever that 80 million people were killed. Only right wing blogs have said that because they didn't think about it for 5 minutes after they read it. "

Muslim leaders have killed millions. The specific numbers cited were bullshit.

"Some estimates say 270 million. Maybe the large numbers bother you. The Islamic conquest wasn't the only source of death in the world. Genghis Khan and his army ""only"" killed a 1/3 of Islam but there are records of them as well. Such as when his grand-son Hulagu sacked Baghdad. Interestingly enough the estimates of deaths by Islam don't consider the Mongol invasion even though the latter day Mongols converted to Islam themselves. WW1 and the Ottoman empires wars against Russia or the Armenian genocide isn't counted very often either.  "
"**Hold on, can I assume that by your relative lack of addressing my point about learning and memory, that you agree the you do have to remember things to learn/know about them?**

Because once that's out of the way, I can address what you just wrote by repeating my post just before my last one.

 what you said was ""who remembers world war 2?"" which can mean living through world war 2, it can mean the facts someone has learned about world war 2, it can mean anything people commonly associate with world war 2 and to a degree the subjective things individual people place under the label of world war 2

Not ""who remembers living through world war 2?""

Those are two very different statements. 

But again, whether or not someone experienced world war 2 firsthand or not has *no* bearing whatsoever on their ability to be able to compare statistics.

Why would it? Why do you think someone needs to have lived through world war 2 to understand how 60-75 million deaths compares to any other number?"
"I don't have a problem with any number. I personally despise Islam. I would love to see the religion disappear. However these numbers have zero basis in reality or evidence. 

Genghis Khan and his immediate descendants who did most of the killing and conquest were not Muslims. There is no reason to include them in the numbers. After the third generation or so after Genghis Khan, the khans in charge of the Muslim world started converting. They should be included. "
[deleted]
"Well to establish exact numbers is problematic in the sense of-How many deaths were directly caused by Jihad. Without this criteria the numbers can be astronomical but it simply wouldn't be ""fair"".

I'll use the muslim mongols as an example. The Italians and the muslim golden horde ,under Jani Beg ,fought several battles at Caffa culminating in a siege there in 1347. The Italians were trying to end the slave trade of Europeans and Rus to the Islamic Mameluks in Egypt and Turkey. During the siege the mongols launched plague victims over the walls to infect the city. This led to the spread of the Black Death. It killed 75-200 million people. You can't really add this to the number because it was an unintended consequence and the plaque would have possibly spread to Europe via some other route.

Here's an excellent article on a CDC website about the siege of Caffa and the plague.

 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/9/01-0536_article


But if you wish to validate the further direct Islamic contributions to the 240 million its rather easy to start building the horrify number. Here are just 3 points in three places

Greek genocide 750-900,000 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_genocide

Armenian genocide 1.5 million http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide

Assyrian genocide 275-400,000 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_genocide

All combined and you get like 5 million deaths. Almost all other Muslim conflicts had way less than these numbers. It's simply not possible to get a number like 240,000,000.

"There are also untold stories of suffering that one can add to the list of deaths. The Arab slave trade put 10-18 million human beings into slavery.

"People still have living grandparents who experienced World War 2. I do. Nobody knows anyone who lived through the Civil War. It's kind of a pun-ish way to go about it, but that simple fact makes world war 2 much more relatable. Additionally, the fact that it ushered in the cold war and the threat of nuclear weapons, which still remains a sinister threat in this day and age, means that it still echoes in our current zeitgeist. 

I do enjoy the fact that you're repeating yourself as if somehow I haven't directly responded to the concept of distinguishing one type of remembering from another, even though the distinction holds no relevance to the subject matter. 

When you say ""Yes you can know something ABOUT an event without remembering the event"", what you should have wrote is, ""Yes you can know something ABOUT an event without remembering the *experience of* the event"". That's why I keep telling you that what you wrote was ""who even remembers world war 2?"" you didn't write, ""who remembers world war 2 personally"", or ""who experienced world war 2?""

You can of course have experienced world war 2 and have been familiar with the men in your town going off to war, and the messages being sent back of their deaths, and of the many widows, and maybe you might have noticed some of the demographic effects in the post-war period. That is probably the extent that firsthand experience of the war had over someone who learned about it later. An emotional one. But for simple comparison of numbers, within historical context, there is no added benefit to being able to relate to the specific conflicts. You have been fighting to try and make a distinction about something that doesn't matter. I mean I tried to get you to answer it, let's try again. Why do people need to personally relate to those numbers to understand the bloodiness of a conflict? Even people who lived through the experiences didn't personally relate to every thousandth or millionth casualty. At best they could relate to the atmosphere it generated. 
"
"Christianity is a much larger and more widespread religion than Islam. Does that mean that there necessarily needed to be almost half a billion deaths in order to extend the religion that far? No. Obviously not.

No they are not. They are virtually exactly the same. I get get into the weeds with you on scripture if you want.

This is absurd. Hindus killed millions and instituted one of the most humane systems of social organization in human history, the caste system. At least the Quran for all it's faults teaches that all humans are born equal. 

Atheist rulers like Stalin and Mao killed many tens of millions each and enforced Atheism on hundreds of millions. I am an atheist myself, but I am not going to sugarcoat it just to make my belief system look better. 

Christianity was spread by the sword to billions of people. It was spread through first the Roman emperor adopting it and spreading his religion through violence. Then it was enforced on the pagans throughout Europe. Then it was spread to the Americas through the killing of millions. Cortez alone killed millions in his blood drenched conquest of Mexico, spreading Christianity and sacrificing natives the whole way through. It was spread to Africa through colonialism and subjugation of natives. In Europe they killed tens of millions more for believing the wrong form of Christianity in the Thirty Years War. 

> Even the worst ,most notorious, examples of Christian persecutions like the Spanish inquisition killed AT MOST 5,000. It's also interesting to note the inquisition was in response to muslims being IN Spain.

Haha, the inquisition was not even close to being the worst. It's child's play compared to other Christian atrocities. It's just notorious because it targeted Jews who were disguising themselves as Christians. The imagery of people being tortured for what they were suspected of doing in private stuck with people for some reason. Like the witch hunts in America.

> Also its interesting to note that the 10 million slaves you listed were purchased from Muslim slave traders from places like Zanzibar. 

Almost all slaves, the ones the Arabs got as well, were purchased from local tribes. Some were Muslim, but most had indigenous local belief systems.

But saying that Jesus and Muhammad taught virtually the same thing is quite shocking. Jesus never killed anyone nor did he instruct others to do so. Jesus never held slaves or instructed others to do so. Jesus never raped nor did he instruct others on how to. Jesus was non-violent and taught people to love their fellow man. He was known as the ""Prince of Peace"" - Jesus is recorded as kicking out corrupt money lenders out of a place of worship. None of them were hurt. The only recorded person hurt around Jesus was a Roman soldier who was cut by his follower Peter during the arrest of Jesus. Jesus healed the soldier and :

Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword (Matthew 26:52, King James Version)

Its OK to kill non-muslim children

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used not to kill the children, so thou shouldst not kill them unless you could know what Khadir had known about the child he killed, or you could distinguish between a child who would grow up to he a believer (and a child who would grow up to be a non-believer), so that you killed the (prospective) non-believer and left the (prospective) believer aside. (Sahih Muslim 4457) 


It is reported on the authority of Sa'b b. Jaththama that the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him), when asked about the women and children of the polytheists being killed during the night raid, said: “They are from them.” (Sahih Muslim 4322, see also Bukhari 52:256)

""Then the apostle sent Sa-d b. Zayd al-Ansari, brother of Abdu'l-Ashal with some of the captive women of Banu Qurayza to Najd and he sold them for horses and weapons."" (Ibn Ishaq/Hisham/Hisham 693)

Its OK to rape whether you ejaculate in them or not.

""We went out with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing 'azl (Withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception). But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he said: It does not matter"" (Sahih Muslim 3371)


Its OK to rape a captive

I drove them along until I brought them to Abu Bakr who bestowed that girl upon me as a prize.  So we arrived in Medina.  I had not yet disrobed her when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) met me in the street and said: “Give me that girl.” (Sahih Muslim 4345)

I started out by asking you to support your belief of why you think world war 2 and the civil war are equally unrelatable today, and how that belief counters the points that I brought up in support of its relatability. You just didn't even try.

Secondarily, and this is for the sixth time- I'm not arguing that experience and reading about something are the same thing. I'm saying, that your original sentences, the context in which you use the word ""remember"" do nothing to convey the idea that you were solely referencing experience. 

And, furthering that point, you have repeatedly failed to explain why that remembering experience has any bearing on comparing the casualties between conflicts. 

This whole discussion basically is me telling you that you're not answering the questions, and you getting pissy that I'm not ""understanding your language"".

"1) this point kind of relies on the idea that the only way we can relate to something is if people who were alive to experience it are still around. 

But why is that the case? If it were, then the study of any history beyond the last living generation would be pointless, because there would be no one alive who could tell you, in person, what living through the black death was like, or how life was in ancient Egypt for example.

Fortunately, people don't think like that, and have come to the understanding that there are other sources aside from living human beings that are reliable sources of history and can help us understand what living in that time period was like. Long after the last veteran of world war 2 dies, the diary of Anne Frank will serve as a testament to how difficult it was to be a jew in nazi germany. 

Living people are not our only ties to history. They aren't the only thing that keeps it ""relatable"". Therefore your measurement between those two wars is invalid.

2) I did a minor in psychology. I took a whole course on memory (as well as neuroscience, neurochemistry, lots of brain stuff). You tried to say that remembering and knowing are two different things. Well, what you actually wanted to say was remembering from personal experience and remembering from someone else narrating their personal experience are two different things, because I can tell you with my background that you cannot learn anything without memory. The very act of learning requires you to commit something new to memory. That's not my opinion, that's fact. If its of any value, I had to create an entirely new wiki page as part of a memory project on the management of traumatic memories, so I did quite a bit of study on how psychotherapy involving ""relearning"" techniques can help modulate painful memories. 

But actually anyone with basic knowledge could make the same argument I did. Learning and remembering are the same thing. The only way you sort of get around that is by changing the definition of remembering, which you later did, to say, ""remembering the experience of the event"" as opposed to ""remembering the facts of the event"", but notice, they both involve ""remembering"".

3. Aside from the fact that Syria has been headline news for the last several years, indicating that people, do, in fact care about it, how does trying to provide context to a body count using some well known wars hinder a person's understanding of the situation?

And 4th, why has it taken 3 hours for you to finally write something that looks like a decent debate response? "
[deleted]
"1. Relative relatability? As in how one relates to how one relates to something? Did you really write that? 

I'm not explicitly saying that reading about an event provides one with greater understanding than reading about it does. I'm saying:

Living through something is not the only useful means by which a person can hope to relate to it. 

Also, since we're discussing wars, events that took place over many years, and on a very much larger scale than an individual, say, as compared to an event like the Hindenburg crashing, the scope of understanding a person who has lived through said wars is not as useful. No one person witnessed all of World War 2. A great deal more information is contained in many books about World War 2 than any person who ever lived through it. So again, giving such weight to personal experience as to discount every other method of knowing as being less relatable, and therefore less relevant or useful, is dumb.

And then, probably the weakest part of your point here is ""almost nobody living experienced either one"". Well, we know that nobody living experienced the Civil War. So using your argument, it is not relatable at all. But to have lived through World War 2 with some memory of it, you just have to be 80. Surprise! There are still 80 year Olds in the world. Now your argument is, there's so few of them compared to the population today that it is irrelevant and that's where I say, now you're mixing up what you should be comparing. You should be comparing the living people who remembered each war, civil and ww2. If one is zero, and the other is not, then using your measurement of relatability (even though it's silly), then ww2 is obviously more relatable than the civil war.

2. Your example of someone in person saying ""I remember World War 2,"" is not the same context of someone asking ""Who remembers a war 70 years ago?"", which is what you *said*. What you said can be read as ""Who remembers *of* a war 70 years ago?"", in which case, anyone who has ever heard about World War 2 can say ""I do."" It can too, be read as, ""who remembers a war 70 years ago personally,"" but your sentence doesn't specify this. 

Again, it's not what you tried to say, it's what you said. You spent the next 5 posts trying to tell me that there were two different kinds of remembering, when you made no distinction with that sentence initially.

3. That's your objection? Because it looks like your objection has been that people don't relate to those numbers on a personal level. 

The argument that you're stating now suggests the possibility that a person may be misled by isolated numerical data and draw the wrong conclusions because their knowledge of the subject for which statistics are being presented is limited. And that's true, that is totally possible. 

But not knowing the historical context in which those conflicts occurred can be fixed. A person can read about any of those conflicts and decide that comparing body counts between conflict a and conflict b is foolish, because of some fundamental difference in the way wars were fought, for example.

But again, that's something that is going to be more clearly understood by reading than experiencing it, which would give you the kind of information necessary to decide that the American Civil War is a better comparison to present day Syria than world war 2 is. You could have said that from the start, it would have been much more sensible rather than making a vague statement about remembering world war 2.

I think what you need to realize is that just because you can personally relate to a time period does not necessarily mean that you have a better understanding of it when it comes to context of comparing it with another time period. Sometimes without the benefit of hindsight you don't grasp the bigger picture of the whole event. And like I said, living through world war 2 will not make you an expert on world war 2, nor will it necessarily give you an a level of understanding of suffering, that for others who came later, is simply incomprehensible. The idea that that is the case is ridiculous. World War 2 is simply too large an event to say that the way to relate best to casualty statistics is to have lived through their reporting. The same goes for the Civil War. Do you think that bomber gunner I interviewed really knows about the shift in political climate in Germany post-WW1 which led to conditions being ripe for Hitlers rise to power? The majority of deaths he saw were during aerial sorties, either due to enemy aircraft or flak. How does that experience make him better able to relate with a Syrian civilian who lost half their family in a sectarian massacre? 

I would argue that the relatability of those statistics has nothing to do with whether or not you lived through the time period in which they occurred, but rather, if you understand the time period in which they occurred, and generally speaking hindsight is 20-20. That's what history is. Later analysis of events that provide deeper insight. 

How do you measure ""significantly"", when you say that WWII is not more significantly relatable to the current generation than the Civil War?

What are your arguments to counter the notion that WWII has echoed much more strongly in the present day than the Civil War has, given that it ushered in the Atomic Age which affects current ideas of energy consumption, and things like potential global conflict between nuclear powers, say, regarding Ukraine right now, or intermittently India and Pakistan. Or what about the fact that the Holocaust is called *the* Holocaust because even though holocausts have occurred before and after the program instituted in the third Reich, that no other campaign of genocide has left such as impressionable mark on this generations mindset. It continues to be brought up in discussions about the Levantine conflict, both as a defense of the nation of Israel, and as an accusation against them regarding their treatment of Palestinians. Or what about cultural carryovers from WWII? From Hollywood you have things like pearl harbour, saving private Ryan, enemy at the gates, band of brothers etc. What about the slogan ""keep calm and carry on"" which has been adapted from British ww2 war propaganda to become a popular meme? What about the advancement of computer science by Alan Turing and what it means for our attempts at artificial intelligence today? What about German developments in the field of rocketry and what they've meant for our space programs? What about the rise of neo-nazi groups in eastern Europe and the resurgence of far right political parties in various European nations? These are all things which we have in present day which have some very strong relations to world war 2. In fact, specifically with regards to Ukraine, one popular position is to not act with appeasement towards Vladimir Putin as Neville Chamberlain did with Hitler in response to German aggression in Czechslovakia and Poland. So tell me, with the fact that current events are almost daily compared to situations that occurred in world war 2, how is it that you think world war 2 isn't relatable to this generation? Hitler is this generations napoleon. The final solution is this generations holocaust. World war 2 is our ""war to end all wars"" and it's something everyone learns about in school. How is it not significantly more relatable than the Civil War?"

"It's not an essay, my first sentence isn't my thesis statement. 

You either address the points or quit for a 3rd time. That's really all there is to it. I have countered every single point you have made, I haven't ignored any section of your writing, and at no point have I insinuated or explicitly stated that I won't read what you write. You however, have repeatedly done all those things. If you were to just judge the debate not on the strengths of the arguments but just on each of our ability to actually debate you would have lost when you tried to end it by saying nothing but calling me blind. 

And the reason that sentence I quoted sounds nonsensical is because it's structured hilariously and is overly wordy. You could have just said, ""We relate better to the present day than we do to the civil war, because we live in it."" Much simpler. 

But the idea that statement carries is an obvious one. Of course we do. 

My question that follows is how does simply relating to a time period of conflict allow you to understand statistics about it better? Even if the point of showing the statistics is to convey some sense of suffering, not everyone who lived through world war 2 experienced the same level of suffering nor did anyone experience the entirety of the war's suffering. The best you could say is that of the people who did suffer in world war 2, no data or other experience could completely convey the horror they had to live through, and therefore they relate to it the best. Why that stops anyone from being able to compare conflicts based on statistics and historical context, you haven't said. "

Remember that Saudi prince caught with all those drugs in his plane? Want to take a guess what kind of drugs they were and what the ISIS preferred stimulant is?

"Perhaps interesting that heroin got its name from its supposed similar effect on fighting men. It was launched by Friedrich Bayer in 1889. After acetyl morphine (heroin) came acetyl salicylic acid, aka Asprin.

Another eventually big pharma company, Merck, had as its first major product morphine.

Captagon is phenethylline, a molecule produced by linking amphetamine and theophylline. The latter has minor medical uses, and is related to the active ingredients in coffee and chocolate. So they are really taking amphetamine, which mixed with caffeine is Yaba/ bhul bhuliya/ shabu , the drug that around half a billion are supposed to be taking in SE Asia to boost their productivity. So Isis has that in common with factory workers all over Asia. "

"> I guess the coalition is giving up on Isis as a solution to the Assad problem.

Obama doesn't really talk about Assad or the FSA anymore.  And Putin recently said that keeping Assad in power is no longer a priority.  I'm pretty sure what they agreed to in that hotel lobby is that the Syrian government will stay in place, the Syrian Army will stay employed (lessons from Iraq), Assad will retire or flee, and they will promise vague democratic reforms.  

The US will get to say that they won because Assad is gone. And Russia will get to say they won because the Syrian government stayed in power and they kept their naval base.  It would be a good compromise."

"Yep, there is still great people in this world that care. Another example my mom has been meeting up with my brothers friend that shes know all his life (28) for the last week and helping his homeless ass out. Hes a big time meth user been a drug addict nearly his whole adult life. I was never a victim of circumstances, I built that rocky road by choosing to hang out with shitters. Now this guy had a really bad child hood and found older friends that completely treated him like family, unfortunately they got him using drugs early.  My moms had enough of lets just call him (28) and told him hes got 1 more week of his shenanigans and has been making sure he has alittle cash and food in his belly. On sunday night he has to stay at her place and monday morning shes dropping him off at jail ( hes got a warrant) the kicker is if he follows through she will be there for him when he gets out and help him get into a sober living house, if he doesnt she will no longer speak to him again. Which is kinda cruel cause she uses his vulnerabilitys to her favor, hes got probably a hand full of people that care for him
But anywho it was $35,000 cause it was a special physique rehab. Meth devastate the mind and makes you evil. When they say ""not even once"" everyone should take it as a warning cause they mean it.

We should record this alongside the restocked seeds just so that the future never forgets how shortsighted we can be if we're not careful 
"If anyone else was confused like I was and isn't able or willing to read the article here's a tl;dr: a research team partnered with the vault organization and based out Syria had deposited 116k samples into the vault and are now requesting approximately a third to be returned, among which are many drought resistant food crops,in order to replenish stocks that had been destroyed in the war."
"> It has more than 860,000 samples, from almost all nations. Even if the power were to fail, the vault would stay frozen and sealed for at least 200 years.

That's pretty neat-o, glad this is a thing.  Also of note

> Many seeds from the Aleppo collection have traits resistant to drought, which could help breed crops to withstand climate change in dry areas from Australia to Africa.

In these times of climate change, anything drought resistant is the way to go."
"[Here's a gallery of the seed vault with an infograph](http://imgur.com/a/RUmV0).

How many world-wide doomsday facilities like this exist in the Arctic? "
This is why this project is awesome. I wish we could do this for animals as well as plants.
"So if I'm reading this right, the war has caused about 12.5% of the doomsday seeds to be removed from the vault? Will these be replenished/restocked later?"
"it their own held samples were damaged, then why withdraw them? That just brings them to the danger that has already damaged other samples.


Waiting until the civil war ends, if that is possible, would seem best"
Shouldnt they wait until there no war going on to replace the ones Syria lost?
And we thought it was bad before.
"Well, it is Doomsday."
"this is so cool ! now I know where to go when the zombie apocalypse happens,"

Noah had a project like that.
"Pretty sure we already have DNA ""banks"" that store DNA information for most of the world's animals, even recently extinct ones."
What is conservation?
I don't think so. It's written that ICARDA deposited 325 boxes. And I think 325 boxes is too few for such a complex. There's certainly other organisations and people that deposited other boxes. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3lwbxk/seeds_removed_from_doomsday_seed_vault_as_a/cva6lga
"Yes, ICARDA are going to restock the vault after they have grown some more seeds in undisclosed locations in the middle east."
"In case you're not trolling and you're just illiterate, the vault is on Svalbard, a norwegian island."
GMO crops are intentionally made sterile because otherwise the seeds could be 'pirated'. Terminator seeds and all are basically the GMO variant of DRM.

Mother fucker that's interesting. 
What.. here I was thinking we'd be turning into Mad Max..
"That's because it has distance and environment to protect it.  800 miles from the north pole in norweigian archipelago.... To get there you need a boat because there's no airstrip, you need warm gear because it's freaking frozen all year, you'll need a supply of food to survive the trip, you'll need fuel to return... and for what...?  Seeds.

No one is going to take the time, cost, and effort needed to rob the place over some seeds... at least, not while we still produce as much as we produce."
Erm so how are the seeds meant to be retrieved from to Arctic and planted if all life is wiped out ?
"> I would hardly call it a ""doomsday"" facility

>It's a simple facility out in the arctic ...  if there ever is, for example, an asteroid that wiped out most life on earth

So you wouldn't call it a ""doomsday"" facility, it's more of an ""in case an asteroid wipes out most life on Earth"" facility? Yeah, an asteroid wiping out most life on Earth doesn't sound at all like Doomsday. Sounds more like Tuesday."

"You need much more to bring back a animal species back though, because you need a another species with very similar cells to put the DNA into, plus a womb that's compatible, and you also need a breeding sized population sample (1 animal isn't enough, iirc you need like 100-10000 depending on species), plus the animal might not survive without the right environment/ecosystem conditions etc. Even with all that I don't think we have the tech yet. Still any effort is a step in the right direction."
Maybe it's just 12.5% of the seeds that Syria donated.
"GMOs still pollinate and produce seeds.  As nothing is perfect, especially in genetics, the issue becomes that there won't be a 100% success rate for the terminator seeds and it could produce fertile seeds which would then co-mingle the GMO changes into the strain."
"I mean, why use seeds that were sent for a Doomsday vault?  I know this is a bad situation, but it isn't a doomsday scenario.  Just get grain from other countries.

If they plant these seeds, who's to say they won't be destroyed either."
Yes.  Let them starve.
Plant something else. If you need food NOW you don't need seeds...
"A lot of people think global warming will be the end all of humanity. And that's certainly not true. What it does mean, is harsher weather and massive displacement. So a lot of places that we like to live at, we probably won't be able to live in. And a lot of places that we used to grow food, we won't be able to grow food in again. That being said, some areas will be able to grow more food, and some new areas will become pleasant. 

Global Warming is about human displacement. I'm not saying that we should sit by and let it happen, because it also means mass extinction. But to think that we couldn't survive in a post global warming world is preposterous. It just might not be very convenient for the most of us. "

"Nothing any living thing could survive would turn us into Mad Max. The atlantic ocean is *gone*. Not frozen at the poles, not hanging around as crazy humidity. Gone."
There's an airport barely a mile away.. you can see the vault from the Svalbard airport.
"I get why it is the way it is, i'm only saying that i pictured something else under the term ""doomsday seed vault""."
You'd have to be a Bond villain 
"If all life is wiped out, then it really doesn't matter because there's nothing to rebuild.  

However, let's say 1% of humanity survives (insert doomsday scenario) in caves/shelters with stores of freeze-dried food, it would be nice for them to be able to come out when the dust settles and have some ability to reproduce food and other plantlife since there won't be many other sources of food available and eventually oxygen would need to be replaced by plantlife if humanity were to survive.

It's like a parachute, if the plane blows up and you're in it, the parachute doesn't help.  If the plane has a big problem and is going to crash and you have a parachute and jump, you've got a chance at survival.

The seed bank is just that, a chance.  I'm glad it exists and I think they chose an excellent location for it.

"I can only assume that there would be scientists somewhere in the vicinity who would know what to do, as well as when to do it. They wouldn't want people to open the vault too soon and destroy the seeds somehow."
"Most likely:

ICARDA (not Syria) deposited (not donated) around 116,000 of the more than 860,000 samples (so, around 13.5%), it is now requesting 130 of the 325 boxes it had deposited, meaning 40% of what they had deposited

But the article is a bit ambiguous, so it's also possible that:

ICARDA (not Syria) is now requesting 130 of the 325 boxes it had deposited (not donated), meaning 40% of what they had deposited. This 130 boxes contain around 116,000 samples, which means the 325 boxes in total have around 290,000 samples, or about 34% of the total amount of samples in the vault (more than 860,000). This one seems a lot more unlikely."
"Even if that happens, it's the question if the resulting offspring is even fertile. GMO strains can be different enough from the original to be technically another species."
You actually have a good point there
This is what I don't understand. It's entirely possible to get these seeds from a number of nations. My guess is they're more or less taking them back. So they're not having to buy the seeds. 
"I'm not sure, but I think ICARDA are researchers and will use the unique seeds they had deposited to research and breed new drought resistant seeds. They're not withdrawing them to plant in fields."
it probably has to do with money. who's gonna buy seeds when they can just take back what was given
I have a feeling that you know a little about albedo.
"Actually no. [Most of that study](http://message.snopes.com/showthread.php?t=86277) was only in Australia (based on a study by a coal giant hmmmm) and in fact we are cutting down far more trees than are going up woops. And here's another argument against the root of the desert greening argument: [More CO2 is Better](http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-plant-food.htm)

tl;dr increasing greenery in **some areas** will not be enough to create a 'biological feedback control' because not all environments respond to increased CO2 in the same way, we are consuming far more greenery than we are replenishing, just because there's more CO2 doesn't mean it will reverse decades or centuries of depleted or outright hostile soil, and also the increased greenery is just as likely to end up more damaging in the long time if the greenery turns out to be non-native."
"Ok, so you need a plane, fuel, pilot, navigation system, and hope that the airstrip isn't covered in snow/ice since it won't be maintained during a catastrophic event.  The distance, location, and environment are still protecting it.

Serious question: Why can't we airdrop food to them?
"This is pretty much one of the worst things I have seen.  I don't care if you support one side, or the others, but these people are innocent and need our help.

If we can pull together to bomb the shit out of people, surely it is within our capability to come together so these men, women and children don't starve.  What did they ever do to deserve that?"
Those people can easily  be recruited by isis since the majority of European countries are not allowing them in. So in the future if any terror attack happens in Europe you should blame those countries 
shame these people didn't move to europe

They are maybe hezbollah, isis, regime.  
Also, those civilians maybe from another city.

A. Taken by rebels or ISIS

B. Not be accepted due to worry of being killed by rebels or ISIS for accepting western aid

Article is about Madaya and video is from Madaya. If that was an isolated case the civilians would have left already. But it isnt. Terrorists want to keep human shields.

The fuck are you on about? Rebels are supported by western powers, and they publicly say this, they're not ashamed of this. And again, ISIS doesn't exist anywhere near Madaya. Al-Nusra is allegedly in Madaya, and even they wouldn't starve civilians for that kind of bullshit, as seen previously.

That's because it isn't about defeating the evil super villain - that's just slick advertising.  It's about growing the weapons market.
Well first the US Govt will have to knowingly give Al'Qaeda access to a school and set them loose.

Syria buys Iranian oil, true. But doesn't sell it to anyone. The other Arab states have nothing to do with Iranian oil. It doens't exist any block of NATO on shipments in the Middle East (if so, what Bahrein, Qatar and EAD are doing then?), only an economic sanction that difficults bank transitions involving Iranian oil - which is easily circumvented, since China and India pay in gold, because yolo :) .

>Syria is an Iranian ally. Iran is trying to become independent, and outside of the US sphere of influence. Iran has too much oil for the US to allow this to happen.

Syria is an allie of Iran, true. The point is, Iran already is outside USA sphere of influence, but the USA are doing a pretty job making it a hell. And the reason for this isn't only the oil, but the strategic localization of Iran.

>Syria has been a target of the US since they took a neutral stance during the Cold War.

False. Syria is an old ally of Russia (URSS on Cold War), since the times of al-Assad father.

Sadly, true.

>Also, the only countries that would arm the rebels are 1) The US, 2) Saudi Arabia, 3) The UK, 4) France, 5) Israel. And they are all on the same side.

The list is somewhat innacurate. The USA arms rebels to keep a weak Syria as long as possible. Saudi Arabia, for ideological reasons (both Saudi and a large amount of rebels are Suni'i), it's the biggest supporter. France has an interest only in selling weapons, but wouldn't do directly with the rebels, for political reasons. So, they use the Saudi as a bridge - both parties recently signed a quacklionnary contract on French weapons. UK has nothing to do with all that mess. And I can assure you, the last thing Israel wants is a country full of takfiris jihadists, armed till the teeth and ready to wipe Israel of the Earth.

secondly any arms coming from qatar and saudi arabia are not trucked to the borders.  they are flown in to military bases that they don't have access to the airspace or the bases themselves.  

"
Yet again a simplistic doughy response that completely ignores all the inconvenient facets of the war that doesn't fit your narrative. Like ignoring the fact that the mujahedeen in Afghanistan in the 1980s did not equal the Taliban and was composed of other moderate factions such as the Northern Alliance... I guess the real crime was that we failed to keep supporting the Northern Alliance after the old communist government was overthrown.

The green berets (as far as I've read) didn't train the Taliban, the US literally had 10 CIA agents in the entire country, the US acted through Pakistan.

Uh-huh.
"And if you want to say they're lying and *are*, in fact, arming al-Qaeda, you have to give at least the barest argument as to *why in fuck* they would do such a thing.

Whether you think they're lying or not, arming al-Qaeda makes *no fucking sense*.  It would be retarded of them.  You'd have to believe that there are a bunch of people in the CIA, State Dept, White House, and Congress who look at the Middle East and say, ""you know what?  We should give al-Qaeda weapons.

Looking at a map of the Middle East, you can see that the United States has made either an ally or a client state out of almost every single country in that region. Countries in this anti-Western club may have joined for good reasons or bad, but the point is that when Syria falls, and it will, Iran will be left in political isolation. Most people on reddit might want that, I don't know.

Her testimony was considered credible because there was limited information coming out of the area. It was widely reported and cited numerous times by United States senators and the president in their rationale to back Kuwait. It was even corroborated by Amnesty International. When the United States did intervene in Kuwait, they found her testimony to be unsubstantiated. There was no proof.
In 1992, it was revealed that Nayirah's last name was al-Ṣabaḥ and that she was the daughter of Saud bin Nasir Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States.

The use of violence was primarily in self-defense because protesters were arrested and tortured/killed indiscriminately (including children). What I find crazy is how many Americans and armed chaired ""experts"" like to turn it into an argument that this is all the West's fault somehow and that it wasn't the fault of a regime who uses military force to crack down on protests. It's honestly pretty pathetic how some here think this isn't a war started by the people over obvious brutality rather it was a war started by the media because their is an indirect belief that the Syrian people are somehow too stupid or too oblivious to start a revolution without the West or the Media propping them up. This is a war between the Syrians with various complexities that were undeniably started by a regime seeking to set up a state based on sectarian favoritisms and brutality."

"If the rebels weren't waging a propaganda war they would have already lost. When you fight, you fight with everything. Remember that truth is the first casualty of war. "
"Didn't the rebels try and get a news crew killed recently by directing them to the front lines so they would get caught in the crossfire, thus invoking the wrath of the West?"
"Gradually the truth of what's going on in Syria is being totally manipulated in the media is becoming more widespread. People are understanding that so much of what they hear is designed to make them feel a certain way and facilitate a nefarious agenda. The warmongers are loosing the information war which is a major part of their winning strategy. 

This is another great article on the disgraceful bias of the media on Syria: http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/12/syrian-opposition-doing-the-talking"
Saw the salon link and thought Greenwald might finally be waking up on this. No such luck. He's failed us all on this one.
"Ok....so now what? He talks about how the rebels and media are manipulating the message. Okay, I get it, that's bad blah blah blah etc etc. But then he talks about how the war will lead to instability, and here's where I don't get it: what does he suggest we do about it? 

This article seems to implicitly support Assad and advocate for non-interventionism, but if the rebels win anyway without western support, is that not Syrian self-determination? Or is he saying that most Syrians actually support the government and we've been tricked? Can anybody clear this up because it's really fucking confusing."
"This is the same kind of pro-regime propaganda that we saw with Egypt, from people terrified of the unknown bogeyman that might replace their nice stable tyrant.  The implication is that people should just put up and shut up with an oppressive and murderous dictatorship just so people in the West can sleep in their beds easier.  This isn't like Iraq, where regime change came from the West.  It's coming from within, from people sick of being oppressed.

Hope the rebels win quickly and can start rebuilding the country.  Would be even better if Russia and China grew a pair and let other countries arm them."
"They're succeeding at it too - anyone can see it if only they want to.
The irony and hypocrisy is outstanding; all our outlets, including the supposedly neutral BBC, are dismissing Assad's statements as downright lies and with condescension and not even bothering to check if what the rebels say is true. It's like those laughably attempts at propaganda during the war - now in colour.

Once upon a time the BBC would smuggle undercover reporters into countries at war and get an accurate measure of what was happening. In Syria they're attached to the rebels and it's a safe bet nothing is allowed out of the country without the [rebel] censor's approval (whom we're supposed to believe doesn't exist)"
"Right, and Assad has nothing to hide...oh wait, he banned media from reporting in his country."
The speed of communication is wondrous to behold. It is also true that speed can multiply the distribution of information that we know to be untrue.

He had his excuse and he was going to use it no matter what. They even used 20 year old massacres as an excuse to invade. In Syria things are completely different, the massacres are happening now, Assad has blocked media access to try to limit report of the massacres. Assad has admitted himself he has chemical weapons, whereas Saddam said he had none (and none were ever found). The UN is running out of options with Syria, while in iraq the UN was begging the USA to please hold off and no go to war. It's actually great to compare Syria and Iraq and see they are different on every single point. "

Just as a side note: Kelly McEvers reporting for NPR inside Syria this week has been really fantastic.  
"There's a contingent on Reddit who want to ""control the message"" in favor of Assad, for some absolutely unfathomable reason."
"Even if NPR isn't corrupt, they get a lot of stuff wrong, simply because they can't pay for a complete staff. That means they have to take a lot of news items on faith alone.

Look, at the start of this mess the media was telling you that it was all about Assad shooting up peaceful demos left and right, and how his government was going to fall any minute now. Then it was about Assad's troops defecting in droves and fighting other Assad's troops, while he was still falling any minute. Now, as he is still in midflight, the rebels are ""divided"", the resistance - ""sectarian"", and the regime will have to be preserved to prevent a ""massacre"" of God only knows who. 

The media audience has been led by its collective nose in a big circle that started with Assad in charge of a repressive regime and is soon going to end with some other asshole in charge of that very same regime.

">Q: Who has banned foreign media from reporting the conflict inside Syria?

The Rebels!

>A: Assad.

ohhh.  I should've guessed that.  Considering that he's the only person with the power to do so in Syria, thus making your point irrelevant, because every country has done the same, and will do the same if the need arises.

>That's the end of it.

No it isn't.  There are armed rebels, armed by Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the US, hiding every place, demanding Assad out on the grounds that he is not Sunni.

Who is at fault, then?  No one.  Everyone.  Human nature.

>It's just like Iran.

irrelevant again.  The US, the UK, France, and whoever the fuck else would do the same in Assad's shoes.  To believe these actions are what make him unjust, you are ignoring the actual unjust shit he has done, and on top of that, ignoring Syria's history, and constant exploitation and destabilization done by the nations I listed above.

This civil war is just more of the same.  It's an unjust Empire and it's friends expanding into an nation.

And let's look at history.  We all know that nations usually end up better off when NOT under a puppet government of the US.  you can already see it happening in Libya, and Iraq is moving in that direction too.  And let's all lol at Afghanistan, as you continue to believe that Syria will be any different.

>Whoever bans the media in conflicts is almost always the culprit and the one trying to shape the message.

false.  Only sith deal with absolutes.

But let me give you something close to an absolute.  Whatever side Saudi Arabia is on, is probably the greater evil."
"Above all else, this. 

Not doing any wrong, let the media in. If you're truly in the right, won't that shine through? 

If your country is truly with you, won't that be made more evident?

Assad's reasoning, as far as I can tell is he doesn't want to loose control of his message and country. Who wants to resign being King? (For lack of a better term)

He wants control it, much like Israel did in the last conflict, keeping foreign media well out of real contact. If he controls the message, or at least believes he does, he feels like he can keep his power.

Why are American Christians supporting the rebels?

The way Putin put it was that Assad's fall would simply make the two sides switch places.  The Allawites and other minorities would agitate against the new Sunni government.  
"The Kurds are more likely going to simply ask for some autonomy in their region instead of asking for more power (Like in Iraq). If anything, I can see more conflict occurring against the Alawites because the Assad regime KNOWINGLY hired many Alawites within his regime because he knew that if a minority has control of a hated regime, they're more obligated to use brutality to maintain control because they perceive it as a fight or die scenario. Overall though, every this is SPECULATION and we really don't know what's going to happen ultimately. We can talk about how, ""Oh, there will be more sectarian violence and Syria will become Somalia"" but that's ultimately us just discussing the negatives as non-Syrians."

Of course as Assad is banning any kind of free press in the country, we'll have to wait until he's been Gaddafi'd until we can get full access and complete confirmation. The witness reports, however, corroborate each other that the massacres started with army shelling. Although as we've seen before there will be no evidence good enough for some, who will be sure it's all special effects and NWO conspiracies.

Like with Egypt, the driving force behind this belief is the far-right and their fear that a power vacuum will lead to a Muslim Brotherhood type arrangement or Marxist state.

- Iraq used massive quantities of chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers during the Iran/Iraq war.  There is absolutely no dispute of historical fact on this point.  There is no logical reason for you to point to one attack on Kurds that may possibly have been carried out by Iran as justification for the notion that Iraq used to have chemical weapons, other than your total ignorance of the course of the war.  

- Iraq destroyed all their chemical weapons and totally dismantled their nuclear program at the end of the Gulf War.  They pretended to have a *chemical* weapons stockpile, not a nuclear program, in order to scare the Iranians.  

- In 2002, that Iraq had no nuclear program, at all, in any way shape or form, was known to everyone on planet Earth who bothered to care what was true. The US government and media lied though their fucking teeth on this issue.  Documents were forged which purported purchases of Uranium from Niger (by the way, who forged them?  Notice how not one investigative journalist in the whole cathedral of Western media has made any attempt to find this out?) They also asserted that Iraq would convert fuel tanks for artillery rockets to centrifuges, a claim so physically ridiculous that only an actually, I mean medical diagnosis, retarded person could accept it as true.  It is these lies in particular which make me want to fucking murder every last one of those mother fucking liars to this day.  

- Iraq supported the MEK, the same anti-Mullah Iranian terrorist organization that the USA supports today.  This was definitely wrong, and also not an act of war against the United States.  Iraq gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers.  This was also definitely wrong but not an act of war against the United States.  Iraq lent no support whatsoever to any anti-American terrorist organization.

It's similar in that Saddam was a strongman who we supported when he was advantageous, and was deposed when we no longer needed him.

Turkey is a different ball game. Turkey is a large NATO country. It's leader is not only arrogant but also very emotional. His country sends a jet in a very suspicous manner to Syria which gets shot down. He lies about the circumstances and then he tries to get NATO to back him up. When they refuse he sends missiles,tanks and jets to the South and threathns to shoot any Syrian jet/helicopter that comes to close to the border in *their own* territory. WTF? It's bad enough that they are openly arming and supplying rebels that attacking Syrian armed forces. They are also harbouring rebels.

Because the political context is entirely different, both as regards the strategic objectives of the U.S., and -critically- the level of oversight that the CIA is subject to here in Washington. It's a very different agency than it was during the Cold War. Do they still do nasty stuff? You bet, but, believe it or not they're on a much shorter leash than they once were. Unfortunately, perceptions are very difficult to change.

>*The CIA is not infallible and they have failed many times, doesn't mean...we should somehow give them the benefit of the doubt.*

Oh I agree. By the same token, however, I don't think we ought to exaggerate what they're capable of, or ascribe explicitly sinister motives to them. They're not bent on undermining democracy for their own nefarious ends, they're pursuing what the executive branch considers to be in the strategic interests of the country.

At least Syria now produces something of value that can be exported.
Not only syria has a problem when it comes to children of low education being recruited to some sort of religious group.
All part of the plan. if you want to fight a war on terror you need the terrorist to have a steady flow of new recruits.

The loss of a single human life is bad. So it's bad.
Now compare ww2 to Genghis Khan and tell me *that* was bad.
How does that guy sleep at night?
I think part of the reason for that is the lack of reports out of ISIS territory.
What is even more shocking is that some idiots on reddit argue that Assad is the soultion to the whole Syrian problem.
Not a well known fact... most of them died fighting on Assads side (or civilians attacked by the jihadists). Another not well known fact... most of the SAA (Syrian Arab Army) are sunni. Keep banging the party line though.
Probably pretty peacefully. He is remorseless.
What is even more shocking is that some people think that somehow things will improve if Assad's government is defeated by jihadists and extremist mercenaries.
Your choices are radical Islamists or Assad. Everything else is a pipe-dream. Very few people like Assad but given the choice it seems a lot of people are choosing Assad.
No its already been released that he has killed magnitudes more than any rebel faction.
Everyone in positions of power over there are remorseless 
No one is advocating for the jihadists to take power. Nice strawman there.
No that is not the only two choices. That is what Assad wants you to think so you choose the lesser of two evils. Why don't we use some critical thinking and find another leader in Syria?
"I'm aware of that.  However, that is the opposition:  jihadists, extremists, extremist jihadis, oh, and about 50 moderate fighters.  There is Assad on one side, and extremists on the other.  If you think that when Assad falls a huge group of moderates will just pop up out of nowhere and seize power, you are a very optimistic fellow!  How many moderate fighters has the US trained with their $500 million budget?  100?  Sorry, but Assad is the moderate side.  There is a reason why 1 million Iraqis fled to Syria when we fixed Iraq.  Now we are going to fix Syria, so where are the poor moderates going to flee?"
"Ok, who has any significant support base in Syria right now that could hold the place in peace against the inevitable insurgency once this open civil war is over?"
"It's possible for Assad to step-down and someone from his regime to rake power, a la Cuba"
"As I said to another person you could have someone from inside the Assad regime step up as was done in Cuba a few years back. The people get what they want with Bashar al-Assad out of power, yet the stability is not greatly changed."
"Edit:  this says it all, a new article posted:  West 'ignored Russian offer in 2012 to have Syria's Assad step aside'

The nation to effect that would be Russia.  Lavrov has already mentioned that they will talk to assad about bringing opposition members into the government.  

The US isn't really working towards a constructive solution.  They had a couple fairly recent opportunities to transition a country from authoritarian rule.  Iraq and Libya.  Which one provides a good template for Syria?  GTFO and let the Russians and Iranians handle it, for Christ's sake!  Why waste our money and resources in Syria?  "
"The man is a dictator in the middle of a civil war. Yeah thats not going to mess shit up. Assad of course has to go and democracy should go to Syria but ISIS has to be defeated first or the situation at least has to be normalised to an extent. Then some kind of deal can be struck with the more moderate elements to the extent they exist. Focusing on Assad to much places to much emphasis on him, he is one man, he is able to do things because people follow him. We don't focus on the ISIS leader too much but the group as a whole, the same logic has to apply to the Assad regime. Changing the head doesn't necessarily change the group."
"So I have an anecdote that gives a little insight on the mindset of some Iraqi's. Not all mind you but... quite a few. So my buddies and I are deployed to Iraq in 2005. We have a small Bazaar outside of our FOB where Locals can sell their wares to U.S. and coalition forces. The main type of products you can find in these types of Bazaars are Bootleg DVD's, knockoff handbags, fake Rolex watches, Alcohol, porn and if you are an Iraqi soldier under aged prostitutes (Who are also the ones selling the booze and porn.) Anyways so were looking at some fake Roles watches to buy and send home as Christmas gifts and such. The guy running the stall starts trying to jack up the price on us and asks for $250 apiece. $250? please its a fake ass knockoff (and not a very good one.) And we were willing to buy several of them at once so there is room to negotiate. Well hard ass doesn't want to come down a penny and there is no way we are going to pay that much for a knockoff so the deals a bust. We tell the guy he can keep his watches for that price. As we begin walking away he shouts out in as loud of a voice as he can ""Thats ok! I will just sell them to your sons when they are here in a few years."""

Sectarianism sure. But what does Sykes-Picot have to do with anything?

But if I can work on your beliefs, your emotions, scare you, exploit your ignorance if you've got some, I've got a much better shot at socially engineering you to *want* to fight.

Colonization and imperialism never enjoys the same popularity among the victims as it has with the colonizers.

This means that the warlords can obtain a lot of disposable gunmen and wetworkers and achieve, even exceed destabilization and population reduction goals organically and at minimal cost.

Put very plainly, there are a lot of people fighting in Syria and elsewhere, motivated by very sincere and very strong beliefs, for which they are willing to die, and also willing to kill, maim, torture others. For some, that cause may be a utopian Caliphate, a sovereign state for this or that ethnic group, others may be devotees of a particular politician or regime they believe shares their beliefs.

What you won't find a lot of is people saying, oh we better watch out or we're going to mess up how Europe carved us up. There's just not a lot of dedication to Sykes-Picot in the Middle East on the same level that you might find among some Europeans.

None of that really matters, though. Bullets and bombs just sound like they're going Boom. But every one really goes ""cha-ching!"" So if you're in the bullet or bomb business, your revenue stream is flowing steadily throughout the process, and maximizing the monetization of America's natural resources in the Middle East all the way over to the Great Game stadium doesn't depend so much on what a particular area is called. As with any business, the point is to get the profits into the pocket. That's about numbers, not names. ;>"

"In the Syrian civil war the regime Shia Assad gets its guns from Russia and Iran. The rebels are Sunni and are increasingly allied to Al Qaeda. So they get their arms from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The US mused about giving arms to the more secular bits of the rebels that seem to be losing influence. Note giving not selling, they have no money. The idea is if they ship arms to the more secular bits of the rebels in the hope that they can out compete both the regime and the al Qaeda allied Islamists.

But your analogy here

> If someone can convince us to fear and hate each other based on anything from religion to foot width, then the gun merchant down the street makes 2 sales.
 
Is not very good - at best the US can make 0.5 gifts - of the two sides in the war only half of one side is sufficiently pro US to get arms. And they can't afford to pay for them. And in a couple of months time it might only be 0.25 gifts as the Islamist bits of the rebels take over even more."

Not if the gun store is in the US and the arms are being sold from Russia or Iran. And actually even if the US shipped arms to the FSA it would probably buy ex Soviet kit - it wants a bit of deniability and most insurgent forces have been trained to use it. 

Look at the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan - the US shipped them some non Soviet stuff like the Stingers but almost everything else was ex Soviet or Chinese because that's what the Mujaheddin wanted.

""How about one of our deniability plans to go with that?"""
"> If the guy in the US gun store has a closet full of ""soviet kit"" down in the basement, he does.

If you look at what happened with the Mujaheddin the arms came from two sources. One was Israel which had captured a lot of Soviet made weapons in the various wars it had fought against the Arabs. The other was China which was then a US ally and had either licensed or reverse engineered most Soviet small arms and also tanks.

See if you're arming an army - even a crappy one like the Mujaheddin - it's not really feasible to collect the arms one at a time from people's closets. You need someone who can fill you up a 20ft shipping container.

"**Summary:** 

>* It also comes as ties between the U.S. and Iran, the Saudis' regional foe, appear to be improving somewhat.

They're right about the UN being useless but complaining because they didn't choose to aid the rebels is absurd. 
"They have the money, they can buy enough gear and hire enough skilled troops to topple Syria. 
Even Russia wouldn't touch Saudi Arabia."
"Never thought I'd say this, but Saudi Arabia is right. That being said I'm shocked that they would refuse the kind of power being on the Security Council brings with it."
And nothing of value was lost.
And perhaps the U.S should have worked with the UN instead of infiltrating the rebellion.
"Hence ~~the Trade Federation's~~ the Saudi's unhappiness about the UN's inability to ""resolve"" the conflict. "
"That's exactly why the Saudis are pissed and throwing a tantrum. They fund the jihadist rebels and hate the Assad regime for its close ties to Iran, which is the state they hate the most (that Sunni versus Shia thing).

They were desperately hoping for a US military campaign in Syria. Because of diplomacy at the UN, they didn't get it. And now it looks like relations between the US and Iran are warming, due largely to effective measures at the UN. This is a bad day for Saudi Arabia, even though it's a good day for pretty much everyone else except their closeted buddy Netanyahu.

The only thing that could make things worse for Saudi Arabia right now is an ""Arab Spring"" style democratic opposition to rise up against their monarchy... but of course, that will never happen, because they mercilessly crush any budding domestic opposition."
But Dont you think Russia should stop supplying Assad with weapons in order to be a credible promoter for a resolution?
"The UN is a diplomatic organization.  From Wikipedia:

>The United Nations (UN; French: Organisation des Nations Unies, ONU) is an intergovernmental organization whose stated aims include **promoting and facilitating cooperation** in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, civil rights, civil liberties, political freedoms, democracy, and the achievement of lasting world peace.

The end result of diplomatic efforts is on the stakeholders at play.  The UN itself is simply a forum for that diplomacy."
"Saudi Arabia is literally at the core of every conflict in the Middle East and Muslim world.

They may be right about the UN being useless-ish.  But they are right for the wrong reasons, in that they wanted the UN to allow a complete destruction of Syria, just to topple Assad and promote oil sales into Syria, and stop oil sales to Syria from Iran.  "
"No real power accrues to temporary Security Council members. And no, Saudi Arabia isn't right, they're temper-tantrum throwing monarchist jerkfaces, mad because the US intervention in Syria was averted diplomatically and the nation is making nice with Iran."
"The UN is like an officious high school guidance counselor who lacks the empathy, brains and imagination to figure out what's best for you, but still won't stop telling you what to do."
Why should they? Assad is the UN's recognized head of state. That's the whole point. Regime-change has been a terrible deadly failure before and after Arab Spring. 
only when the US and Saudi Arabia stop arming the terrorists who are causing this whole mess.  
Fortunately unless you really get out of line you don't have to listen to it.
"That is actually the point of the UN.

It's not a bug; it's a feature."
What's this? A Tea Party Republican making sense? Did Hell freeze over?

"> Syrian Civil War Destabilizing Entire Region

Isn't that the whole point?"
"For anyone unwilling to read the entire article (although I’d highly advise it) here is the summary of what the different conflicts are:
‘Five distinct conflicts have become tangled together in Syria: a popular uprising against a dictatorship which is also a sectarian battle between Sunnis and the Alawite sect; a regional struggle between Shia and Sunni which is also a decades-old conflict between an Iranian-led grouping and Iran’s traditional enemies, notably the US and Saudi Arabia. Finally, at another level, there is a reborn Cold War confrontation: Russia and China v. the West.’"
"Are there still people who believe this is a civil war, it's one of the clearest examples of a proxy war this century.

Qatar Mercenaries/Israel/NATO v.s. Hezbollah/Iran/Russia

Take away all the elements escalating and facilitating this conflict and little remains. It would be as important as [the democratic uprising in Bahrain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_revolution), remember all those protestors murdered by Saudi forces helping out the dictator? of course we don't because that's an ally and no foreign powers had any interest in escalating it."
"Hanging on? He's winning. Syria will soon know peace. Oh wait. We can't have that. So we're giving the ""rebels"" more weapons!"
"This region is destabilizing because our American government, along with NATO and the UN, are paying Al-qaeda to wreak havoc so they can move in and take over when the whole shit just collapses.
They did it in Libya, and now it's Syria.

Your tax dollars at work!"
"Entire region destabilizes itself (ISRAEL!!!) by mouthing off and bombing other countries...

Did Libya bomb Egypt? Nope...

Did Egypt bomb Sudan? Nope...

Did Algeria bomb Tunisia? Nope...

Did Jordan bomb Lebanon? Nope...

Did Syria bomb Israel? Nope...

So, tell us, you fucking jacktard Zionist media propagandistas, WHO IS DESTABILIZING THE REGION!!!???"
"I wonder what he thinks he's holding on to: Ha ha ha ha ha precioussss, all this rubble is mine, all mine."
"Well, if they had any oil in Syria they would surely be freed, but they don't, so fuck them. MURICA"
It's like all of the middle eastern crazies are running into Syria to die. I never want this to end.
"Name me a few wars that weren't ""proxy wars""? 

Major world powers ALWAYS have there hand in the wars of smaller countries.."
"Israel doesn't like either side, while NATO and the Gulf states/Saudis are supporting different rebel groups.

You also forgot to include the Kurds and Iraqis in your equation."
"I don't see how those two things are mutually exclusive.  Haven't a lot of civil wars also been proxy wars?  Heck, you would probably have a hard time finding a civil war during the Cold War that wasn't also a proxy war!"
This...it is well known that Qatar is supplying and paying for this war.  Spending as much as 3 billion a month on the mercs they have hired from various other countries.   Most of the so-called rebel fighters are not even Syrian.   
"FTFY

"To be fair the goverment crackdown on protestors in Bahrain was not nearly as violent as in Syria. In Bahrain they used tear gas, in Syria they use artillery shells. "
Are your scare quotes implying that they are not rebellious?
The idiocy of your statement is dumbfounding.
"Yes yes, it's quite easy to blame Israel for every little thing that goes wrong in the world isn't it. However, it's not really a ""Zionist propagandist"" scheme to assert that since the violence has indeed spilled over on several occasions to Turkey and Israel, Hezbollah and Iran dedicating armed forces to the fight, and with refugees flooding the boarders of neighboring countries that the civil war in Syria is destabilizing the region to some extent. "
That's an over simplication.  All countries always look out for their own good. They have different ways of doing it but at the end of the day civilians get shot. Whether from the air or ground really doesn't matter 
I think its those zany Palestinians with there bottle rockets and rocks
"Syria has oil, just not very much of it when compared to the major oil producing countries in the regions."
WW3 here we go!!
"Kurds are a domestic minority, they have changed allegiance depending on who could provide them superior security at the time, they still refuse to recognize the Syrian National Coalition so I count them as regular civilians defending their homes. As far as I know there is no substantial amount of foreign Kurds actively participating in battles, they just care bout their neighborhoods while wishing for independence. Iraqi fighters are Mercenaries. 

Israel isn't neutral in this, if they didn't want Assad gone the US wouldn't be supporting this farce. In fact the entirety of NATO wouldn't do anything in the Middle East without Israeli sanction."
yea i completely agree Oaklandia. just because it also fits the description of a proxy war doesn't preclude it from being a civil war. 
Russia doesn't give a fuck about any oil pipeline. They need their port in the Med. 
"In my book of geopolitics the rule 'first-come, first-served' should take precedence.

Syria has been a Russian/Iran allied government for 40 years, too bad for the rest, stay out until there is a legitimate government which approaches them."
"No, he's highlighting thr fact that the rebel fighters are fragmented into scores of separate armed brigades that are typically localized and appear to be incapable of coordinating effectively enough to fight the Syrian Arab Army in its heartland. It also acknowledges that rebel fighters are not politically united behind a single civilian government or figure that could pose a realistic and viable alternative to the regime.

That's all."
they are no longer people fighting for a free syria. they are now people fighting for outside interests.
"Says the stupid fucking liberal. If you did some research, you would know the FSA works with Al-qaeda, and that the west gave them heat-seeking missiles. Now, go fuckin' kill yourself, you stupid fuck."
"Riiiiiight, because IDF infiltrating Syrian border, bombing Syrian capital, blaming ""insurgents"", also bombing in Sinai, bombing in Sudan, Israel is the premier disrupter in the region. But I certaiinly don't blame them for the dictatorships that have reigned in the region since 1948....that's pretty much US, French, and Russian affairs feuding over resources (OIL)."
The wording of this headline is propaganda. It's undeniable in your face propaganda. Who on behalf of who I have no idea about.
The situation is lose lose for Israel.  Claiming US support proves Israeli support is just silly.
"Of course you do, your entire reddit gimmick is based on that mistake. It's more a proxy war than a civil war by any definition. I suppose WWII was a civil war too because the resistance killed compatriots who collaborated with Nazi Germany.

""Oh, look, we got rid of Israel and now they're all peaceful and nice and nobody's getting shot! Oh, look over there, we have a Sunni, an Alawite, a Shiite, an Iranian, and a Saudi Arabian all in a group hug!"""
"Assad is an asset of Iran, and Israel is and has been at war with Syria. They clearly have a side."
"what's your point in arguing it is 'more' of x than y. surely you agree it is important to understand the conflict as both a civil and proxy war, precluding one surely only makes it harder to understand, and even harder to resolve. also who on earth cares who fired the first bullet at this point? that's over two years ago, and no-ones going to be prevented from dying by settling that issue. 

i think you should try to be more respectful in your discussion of this as well, it doesn't hurt to engage in a civil discussion from now and again. "
"I thought the rule typically was ""Might makes right"", at least as far as the US seems to be concerned..."
"Aaaaaaan, why would any of these personal regional squabbles involve the US, billions in aide, saturation bombing of our airwaves for the last 60 years. Oh look, jews this, jews that, Israel this, Israel that, terrorist this, terrorist that....the source for just about 80% of all ""terrorism"" in the west has been because Israel's ""needs"", so, yeah man....what was that you were saying?"
And who gets Syria if the rebels wins?  Not friends of Israel.  The Rebels have ties to Al-Qaeda.
"While this is broadly true, AFAIK Israel's relationship with Assad is weird.

There was a lot of chatter in 2008 about a possible breakthrough between Assad and Olmert, brokered by the Turks, where Israel would demilitarize the Golan Heights. The Gaza war interrupted that.

Assad's account: http://www.haaretz.com/news/assad-olmert-agreed-to-give-up-all-of-the-golan-1.272367

The deal fell through so the broad strokes your point still stands. But I imagine it would be a long time before an Israeli politician trusted the rebel leadership enough to even think about making a similar offer."
"Civil war (or Al Jeazeera's WAR WITHIN) is part of the mainstream media lie to convince their audience that this is a conflict between Syrians and their government.

When I was in Aleppo I asked the FSA commander, do you work with the Al-Nusra people, he looked at me like I was crazy, he said of course we do, they are the best fighters we have, they only ask for a chance to die. These extremist fighters are now interwoven with the opposition movement that we are supporting, think about that, we are supporting a movement whose strongest element is linked with Al-Qaeda.”

This is an hostile Islamist invasion, and yes there are collaborators just like in any conflict but as exposed here by this fine US investigative journalist, foreigners are the driving force behind the insurgency, so even calling it a revolution is factually incorrect."

FTFY"
"Even if extremists were to take control of Syria after the fall of Assad (which is speculation), it's still a better situation for Israel than facing a hostile Syria and an empowered Iran. 








"
"Good to be reminded of those times:

>""With the pullout in Iraq, the will for peace, the closing of Guantanamo, (Obama) has shown himself to be a man of his word,"" Assad said

Yikes, no peace in Iraq, Guantanamo still open."
"Are you honestly trying to convince me, and reddit, who have access to thousands, if not millions of videos, twitters, accounts that not a single Syrian has taken up arms against the Assad regime, or in the case of the Kurds, against both the regime and rebel alliance? Even the evidence you quote states that extremist fighters are attaching themselves to a pre-existent 'resistance movement'.

You have every right to be furious about jihadists, the Quataris, etc. hijacking factions, brigades etc. amongst the umbrella opposition, the FSA, but refusing to accept that this is also a civil war of Syrian v. Syrian, pro-Assadist v. anti-Assadist, rural v. urban, brother v. brother misses a major component of this conflict. "
">and yes there are collaborators 

And you turns this into:

>not a single Syrian has taken up arms 

You are being purposely obtuse but heck if fighting a strawman bring you satisfaction then enjoy. I don't even like Assad or the Ba'ath party, BUT when the only political alternative offered is the Mulsim Brotherhood with their Al-Qaeda thugs then I have been given no option at all but to support the Syrian Government. Saudi Arabia doesn't even trust them anymore while Qatar and Turkey remains in complete disregard of the consequences.

Look at Egypt how the minorities are doing now, if they win, this is the future for Syria.
"
"**1st comment:**

>Are there still people who believe this is a civil war

People think you are saying that the war is exclusively proxy.

**2nd comment:**

>It's more a proxy war than a civil war by any definition.

You suggest here that you meant to imply in your first comment that it was *more* of a proxy war than a civil war.

**uptodatepronto then says:**

>what's your point in arguing it is 'more' of x than y. surely you agree it is important to understand the conflict as both a civil and proxy war

This brings up a new argument and it appears uptodatepronto missed your suggestion that it's partly a civil war.

**3rd comment:**

You suggest a conspiracy to headline the conflict as a civil war to hide the fact that extremists are converging on it. (Relevant to this: There was [a statement](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22710061) by the UN today denouncing foreign fighters.)

**uptodatepronto's reply:**

>refusing to accept that this is also a civil war ... misses a major component of this conflict.

Still does not pick up on you suggesting it's partly civil.

**4th comment:**

>You are being purposely obtuse but heck if fighting a strawman bring you satisfaction then enjoy.

It appears you don't pick up the fact that uptodatepronto missed an earlier clue that would have helped him better understand your point.

**Edit:** I'd also like to ask if you think the Syrian war began as a civil war or a proxy war. If it began as a civil war, do you think there was planning for a proxy war before the conflict began?

**Edit(2):** Another thing I noticed:

>What if I told you that the very first bullet fired during a reform demonstration at Syrian police came from an gun held by an Iraqi?

Like uptodatepronoto said, I don't think that's relevant unless you have sources indicating that the incident occurred and that the guy was part of group trying to spark armed conflict. But it doesn't help indicate which component of the conflict is currently more dominant."

They use non specific rhetoric and make it a fact, they use the lives of the innocent as pawns in their global strategies and fear bolstered with ignorance to promote it at home. None of those leaders actually care about the cost, only the result. What will be the straw that breaks the camel's back for the ordinary people? I don't know.  "

Whats is worse is that Abu Sakkar is a leader of a top rebel brigade and his brutal sectarianism is going to drag Lebanon into war.

It does seem like many of the 'hawks' in the govt are pushing to get us involved in this civil war.   It's not clear that there is a 'good' side to be on.
"I'm much more disgusted by the slaughter of noncombatants, especially children. If this guy was already dead, then it matters little what is done with his body. Disturbing and evil yes, but not exactly an atrocity."
"Not even close! Shit, this guy who is having his heart eaten was already dead before he was butchered, so in the grand scheme of things, this is actually pretty low rent in terms of atrocities. 

This is disgusting and disrespectful, sure, but I will argue that there is *no* comparison to the assholes who are gunning down women and children execution-style - which is something FAR more barbaric than what this moron is doing. Hell, in comparison to the cold-blooded mass murder of innocents that is also going on, I think this fool taking a chow break on some dead guy's left ventricle is nothing!"
"Yes, these are the animals that the US and Europe are backing.  The FSA is made up of Al Qaeda and other extremist terrorist groups.   These are the ones that used chemical weapons.

The answer to the middle east has been simple - the Sunnis are extemists of the most insane variety, Saudis have been the primary global sponsor of Islamic education the world over and spread Waahabism - and extreme, violent form of Sunni education.

The US has been training and funding militant Sunni groups from Iraq to Africa, Libya and of course Syria - and they are doing a bang up job of brutally fighting Shia and destroying any hope of a civil Islam for decades.

Military snipers shoot for center of mass (ie the torso). That's how they're trained, since they typically make long range shots and a center mass hit is a likely kill. What's in the middle of center of mass? The spine running right up and down the torso. Hits on the spine or near it are simply likely happenstance. Aiming deliberately for something that's buried beneath clothing and flesh is excessively difficult."
I have a hard time believing Syrian snipers are so fucking good that they can intentionally aim for and hit a spine.

"Don't you love how Israel calls Arabs a bunch of monsters for suicide bombings yet kill 10 times as many Muslim civilians because they used American-made missiles fired from American-made helicopters?  Yes, Arabs are monsters while Israelis fire rockets from 2 miles away into an Arab apartment building."

You clearly didn't read the article.
"Seriously, read the article, they weren't aiming for the torso, they were aiming for the lower spine specifically. If you didn't want them to live you would aim for the head or the thoracic region, chances are that they won't come back from a punctured heart or lung. An injury to the lower spine isn't as life-threatening."
"You're an idiot. Seriously, kill yourself."
Even after reading the article I'm not entirely sure what this has to do with Syria.
I make seed deposits all the time (good side money) but never knew I could make a withdrawal (not that  I would want to). 
">The civil war in Syria has prompted the withdrawal, with researchers in the Middle East requesting seeds to replace those previously stored in a gene bank in the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo."
So youre saying that the researchers want seeds to continue their research elsewhere because they cant get to their labs in Aleppo?
"I'm assuming the Aleppo lab was compromised by fighting, and the researchers no longer have access to whatever seed they are trying to work with. I'm not really sure what research they are working on."

I am really worried that the Sunni vs. Shi'ite conflict which the Syrian Civil War has turned into can be contained. For the same conflict to break out in Iraq would be a disaster.
"This is a good thing for the US and other western nations. Syria has become an enormous resource sink for every group that hates the west: Hizbollah, al Qaeda, Chechen extremists and just about every other fringe extremist group with military aged males and a few rusty Kalashnikovs. 

As the conflict intensifies and spills over to the neighboring third world countries these groups throw away even more money, manpower and equipment that they then can't using against the ""good"" guys all while killing each other off. Plus we get to sell guns and missiles to them the entire time. 

There is a reason the US has been dragging its feet about direct intervention in Syria and now the time has long passed to end this in a timely manner. "

It's nonsense that's why. You're just regurgitating the neo con narrative of when the invasion of Iraq turned into a quagmire. Syria like Libya is an oil rich country. When it falls into Islamist hands the resources expended would be peanuts compared to the acquired riches. 
"FSA is a horribly fractured group now. Some of them want to bring the regime down, while others just want to burn the world."
"I'm not regurgitating anything. I'm voicing my own opinion. Also, the country will never fall in to Islamist hands. Assad is either going to win as he rightfully should or the US, Israel and UN will get officially involved and most likely start WWIII. "

"His world is the real world.

Post-Soviet Afghanistan was ruled by warlords who were granted power by the vacuum left after the Soviet withdrawal.

Their corruption and abuses led to public discontent, and Pakistan-trained fighters and clerics flooded into the region, forming the Taliban. One of the clerics was Mohammed Omar, who was in a Quetta, Pakistan madrassa during the post-Soviet turmoil and who returned to Afghanistan to open a madrassa amid the chaos.

Mohammed Omar was the founder of the Taliban and the ""leader"" of Afghanistan for six years.

The warlords with no public support quickly fell to the Taliban during a series of civil wars and the ""good"" warlords with a great deal of public support retreated to the periphery of the country, forming a state-within-a-state called the Northern Alliance that persisted until the fall of the Taliban. 

The Taliban and Al Qaeda feared the Northern Alliance, its power, and its leader Ahmad Shah Massoud so much that they assassinated him on September 9, 2001, just prior to the 9/11 attacks (after he had warned the West that ""something"" was coming) because they feared that with US support Massoud would lead the Northern Alliance to topple the Taliban.

So if I say this company is trying to put civilians on the front lines to create casualties I'm crazy right?
I don't see this backfiring in any way
"How is Russia calling on 'the West'--whatever that even means here--to accept a peace proposal? Is 'the West' even fighting this war? Or--and correct me if I'm wrong--is this war fought by the Free Syrian Army? Again, correct me if I'm on the wrong track, but I think the rebel's opinion should matter.

> [Assad] dismissed any chance of talks with the armed opposition, however, and vowed to continue the battle “as long as there is one terrorist left,” a term the government uses for the rebels.

How could the FSA accept any part of Assad's terms after this? What was proposed by Russia is preposterous--a fully foreign (moreover, 'Western') led peace process that doesn't include the rebels.

Yeah Russia; you're super fucking helpful.

Right now, I'm sure that Russian media is gearing up to smear 'the West'--again whatever the fuck that exactly means, when the really big players in the conflict are Syria, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, etc.--for rejecting a peace 'plan' that fails to include the Syrian opposition.

With that said, it would be nice if the international community could help broker some peace treaty before Assad falls and Syria deteriorates into...something probably horrible--but that would be utterly impossible without the consent of the FSA and the help of regional powers."
"I think the 'west' in context is the US plus the EU, but with an emphasis on the US.  I think your final point is the one that is most likely the desired outcome, a peace treaty before Assad falls and before Russian interests are overly threatened. "
"Admittance time: I slightly strawmanned Russia.

I guess I owe /r/worldnews an appology for my post. Thanks for keeping me honest, ajehals.

I sort of understand what Russia means by the West...and it's more the NATO alliance--especially Turkey (whether you think Turkey is 'Western' is really up for debate)--than the EU nations (although there's a lot of overlap). This means that the NATO alliance--which Russia has broadly defined as ""Western"" has real capabilities to influence the conflict...so long as Turkey is willing to do anything to halt what looks like a very positive trend for its own interests.

But Russia really is trying to make out the US to be the bad guy here--that I won't back down on. This functions perfectly within Russia's conflict narrative, where Russian media works in tandom with policymakers to present the US in particular as anti-peace while Russia ironically fights a proxy war in Syria. Here, Russia presents the international community--and especially the US--with a ridiculous peace proposal from Assad that they know will get shot down, and it seems to be as much an attempt to make the US look like it opposes peace as it is a real attempt to establish that peace.

Pretty lame."
">I sort of understand what Russia means by the West...and it's more the NATO alliance--especially Turkey

I think it depends on contexts, its a term they can use to pick on any act - whether it's American abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan, French troops in the Central African Republic or British actions in Afghanistan etc.. and press the term 'west' and 'western' into service.  In this case I think its aimed at the US simply because the US would likely be the driver behind any intervention (given that neither the EU as a bloc, the UK, Germany or France as nations, NATO as an alliance etc.. really have the kind of direct interests in Syria that the US does in a regional sense, although I might be wrong..).

>But Russia really is trying to make out the US to be the bad guy here--that I won't back down on. 

You are right, they are trying to protect their interests and don't want the US to push for action that would harm them.  Regime change in Syria will complicate matters for Russia and they aren't keen on that, whether it comes from Syria or from the outside.

I doubt it would come to that, The incident with Russian and NATO troops at Pristina International Airport during the Kosovo war should make it clear to some extent that neither Russia, nor most NATO commanders (if we ignore  General Wesley Clark) would want to end up in a position where they could end up in conflict.

It's my guess both Russia and the US are now just using Syria as a meat grinder for religious-nutters. So lets keep up the rumor that the Damascus airport is nearly over-run and the invaders are on the cusp of winning, as that may draw in more nutters thinking victory is near. I'm very against indiscriminate drone bombing in places like Yemen, but setting a trap to kill vermin seems much more efficient.
"
">It's my guess both Russia and the US are now just using Syria as a meat grinder for religious-nutters.

I don't think that really makes sense for Russia as they probably (one hopes) would prefer a stable (if nothing else...) Syria.  It's not that different from US support for questionable regimes in that human rights records, military atrocities and general nastiness come second when you are looking for strategic military bases or regional influence, albeit holding out during a civil war is a rather novel idea...  It does make sense for the US if, as some reports suggest, you have international jihadists going to Syria to shoot at Syrian Army targets rather than taking the trip to Afghanistan to shoot at Americans and NATO forces.

> setting a trap to kill vermin seems much more efficient.

The problem there of course is the assumption that there is a limited supply of militants.. Syria has at fairly major component of people who actually want to see some type of freedom, maybe not along traditional 'western' lines, but certainly on their own terms, they aren't the same type of international militant as you might have seen in Iraq or see in Afghanistan, they have a grievance and clearly a will to fight (not unlike some of the Afghan fighters in Afghanistan..). Instability breeds instability, the situation in Syria as it stands, or as an ongoing conflict is not good for anyone, not the US, not Russia and least of all for Syrians.

"There is a presence in Baghdad province - ISIS has attacked and captured the town of Taji, which is only 20 miles north of Baghdad proper. An assault on Baghdad itself could be very soon.

ISIS has also threatened to attack the Shiite strongholds of Kerbala and Najaf soon, saying they will cleanse these ""filthy"" regions.

I've never seen a blitzkrieg like this before. It's astonishing. They'll have complete control of Iraq in a week at this rate."
"Lot of really off commentary, or people who have no paid attention to Iraq since Bush left office. The real issue has very little to do with the US, other then the schizophrenic way that the US dealt with the Syria and the red-line situation. The major players at this point are the Iranians (who are desperately trying to hold together the Shia governments in Iraq and Syria). The Shia government (which has marginalized the Sunni population since 2010 in a big non-trivial way), and ISIS. ISIS is not Al Qaeda. They tried the affiliate thing for a bit, but their brutality was too much for Al Qaeda, and they got punted. There might be a veteran of the second Afghani war with these guys, and maybe a few guys who survived the Awakening in Iraq... but the core of these guys are Syrian survivors. 

This is really a new event. US involvement, for all intents and purposes, ended with the success of the Surge. Obama half-heartily negotiated for a status of forces agreement that would keep some troops, and more importantly US mediation between the Shia and the Awakening Councils (the Sunnis). When that presence went away, a coalition between Al Malaki and Iranian groups basically marginalized the secular/sunni groups (led by Alawi). 

All of this has led to a large disenfranchised Army (which is still more Sunni then Shia) who made the exact same calculation in 2014 that they made in 2007 - it's better to see the Shia fail, and have war, then be under their subjugation. The problem is that in 2007, Iran wasn't that big of a factor, Syria wasn't on fire, and the US was paying attention. None of those things are true now. 

When ISIS came on the scene, and ratcheted up the violence, I remember thinking that these guys were going to make Al Qaeda look like choir boys before they finally achieved their martyr-hood. They learned from Al Qaeda's defeat, are well organized, have a border to retreat across safely, probably have chemical weapons and now have a shit-ton of money. There are also allegations of protection from Russia, but I think the phrase dis-interested protection probably applies better. 

As far as Baghdad goes, if ISIS isn't stopped by US airstrikes (which is the direction the administration appears to be going - wanna bet they don't go to congress for authorization?), then they will slam into the Sadr-brigades, which will full-on re-ignite a civil war. Same death squads, same tribal violence, nastier weapons. Baghdad has a Shia population, but it also has a Sunni population. 

Only this time, no Petreus, no Bush pulling a about face and the surge, no international action. 

ISIS won't just stick with what they have. They have a goal - a new celiphate - and they have a enemy - the Shia. If they don't take Baghdad, they risk the Iranians coming in big time with the Al Quds force. They also know that insurgencies are most at risk when they have to move large numbers of people on roads. 

It's going to get worse before it gets better.

ISIL's best hope is to use its enemies mutual dislike of each other (U.S/Al-Assad, Kurds/Shias, Saudis/Iranians, Israel/Hezbollah) to prevent an united front against it, but ask Saddam Hussein how well that idea can backfire. Maybe they can avoid high intensity conflict with one or more of their enemies for a while but their idea of creating an actual state is doomed.

"Iraq is currently being split into three parts--the northern Kurdistan, the predominately western Sunni part, and in the south and east, predominately an area populated by Shiites. In my opinion, geopolitically, Saddam was a necessary evil to prevent the very thing that is unfolding now in Iraq.
Iraq's borders were determined by the League of Nations in 1920 after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Iraq's borders completely ignore internal ethnic and sectarian struggles, and it was necessary to have a strongman in charge to provide internal and regional stability. The US invasion in 2003 completely dismantled the Iraqi state, and it has been weak and vulnerable ever since.
It may be time for the West to rethink the concept of stability in the Middle East. It was designed to be unstable, leading to the emergence of despotic dictators such as Assad and Hussein. The Arab Spring and Western interventions have since removed from power or have directly challenged most of these dictators. Arabs do want peace, but they also live in a regional geopolitical system artificially developed to make the region a powder keg, albeit to exploit its rich oil wealth. Saddam was a despot not because he was evil, but because the internal politics and geopolitical system he lived in demanded it."

"Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be an example for the entire western world, it is sadly not.

The more you hit people in the region, the more locals will join insurgents, rebels, terrorists. The more people join those factions the more you have to spend in security. That's a neverending cicle.

All Afghan war achieved is Al Qaeda getting bigger and stronger and spreading in all the region, especially in Pakistan. All the meddling in Iran in the 70s led to a strongly antiamerican country aiming to nuke the shit out of everybody. 10 years long occupation in Iraq led to insurgents and the need for more US-UN troops.

Freedom, democracy are not something you give people, that's something they take themself, sometimes painfully (look north africa except libya). Especially when exporting freedom is an excuse to control Iraqi resourcers.

White house created a big enemy for the entire western population instead of leaving local conflicts to locals and us and its allies will pay for 30-40 years of mistakes in the region."
"It is highly unlikely Sunni extremists will be able to take over the entire country.  Baghdad and the regions south of the city are Shia.  North of Mosul are Kurdish controlled territories.  What you are seeing is further balkanization of the country where a Sunni regional government will likely emerge, having their own militia and regional government much in the way the Kurds have in Irbil/Sulaymaniyah/Dahuk provinces with their Peshmerga.  As is often the case, these militants have not thought it through.  There is very little oil or other natural resources in the central, Sunni, provinces so any economic viability is in question.

"As an American, I throw my support behind the Kurds. If you allowed them to form their own country, then that is one more front against extremism. They're also the least nuts group in the region.  

And can we please stop the ""this is our fault for invading, so we should do nothing"" bullshit. We can argue history all day. It won't fix the problem. We destroy a country, I believe we have a responsibility to fix it. Letting Iraq fall to extremism or become a puppet of Iran most certainly concerns us. We have an interest, stop saying we don't. 

Finally, I'm getting real tired of having a weak president who learns of this shit on the news. I absolutely understand that these things can come out of nowhere, but having so many foreign policy blunders is starting to get ridiculous. "

I'm sorry for the civilian population in that region, most of all people on the world just want their peace."
"Based on what I've seen I think ISIS only have the momentum advantage. If they want to hold the areas they have captured they need a vast amount of resources which I doubt they will allocate (unless they get helped by backchannels). The whole middle east has been radicalized thanks to the interventions in the past decade. I doubt Europe and US will intervene, however I was surprised to read Iran is willing to give a hand.

Video of a raid by ISIL in 2012, back when they were called Al Qaeda in Iraq. They dressed up as policemen and drove down a highway, massacring police at several checkpoints. It illuminates their tactics extremely well.

Basically, they showed up in the middle of the night pretending to be making arrests. They handcuffed everyone, lay them down on the floor, and executed them with a silenced pistol. Rinse and repeat.

There's a much longer version out there somewhere. Couldn't find it but I'm pretty sure I was able to in 2012."
I think that Iraq is on verge of getting divided into three parts.
"I personality believe there's a general misdirection about who's actually feuding. Obviously there's a long historical feud between Sunni and Shiite, but the current upsurge in combat as it is appears to be far more externally driven. Weapons supplies and geopolitical support aside, the current conflicts in Iraq, Syria, and Iran are undeniably economically influenced by the US, Russia, China, varies segmentations of the EU, and even counties residing in Africa/South Asia. Based on my general observations, taking fully into count I'm far from a professional of geopolitics/information analysis, the divisions between allies and foes seems to resemble Cold War divisions. Forgive any ignorance, but the current situation appears to have been created by an United States presence in the Middle East, a present the is now under contest by individuals armed and protected by powers that were the United States adversaries during the Cold War era. I've come to view these events as a post Cold War continuation. Again though, personal belief."
No more updates? 
Are the ~~Northern Alliance~~ (Im an idiot) Peshmerga prepared/capable of pushing back ISIL out of the north? I know they proved invaluable fighters during the initial invasion. 
Is it hyperbolic to call the invasion of Iraq the single worst U.S. foreign policy mistake in our history? I'm starting to think not...

U.S never its lesson to fuck off the middle east, stop supplying people with weapons and get the fuck out for good. history repeats itself. this time the US  made a ""spill"" and refuses to clean it.

if you think the U.S has nothing to do with his, you are living your american dream. they got blood on their hand as much as saudi arabia and people know it. you are fueling the war and you are the reason the middle east is what it is today. why is it that you people think we are less worthy of life that you keep doing this ? why do you not stand up against your government interference ?

I know it's hindsight, but as a Republican this whole mess did start
with Bush. The problem is a dictator was needed to keep these people
under control. It doesn't matter if we kept troops there 20 years. As
soon as we leave the same problem would happen.

These muslim zealots can not be reasoned with. I hate to say it because i think democracy is the best form of government, but maybe it is not the best system for everyone. These people need a heavy hand to keep them under control and Saddam did that.

I will not play the party cheerleader side, when American lives are at stake. Obama is right to not resend troops. If the Iraqi people really want democracy, let them fight for it.

The only thing i hope Obama does if it gets dire is give asylum or help relocate any Iraqi citizen that does not want to live under a caliphate

"Can someone give me serious explanation on how large extremist groups like this form. I have always tried to keep up to date on current events in the middle east, but have a hard time thinking all of this through. 

My understanding is most of the people in these groups think they are doing the morally correct thing by fighting opposition and trying to bring power to their religious beliefs, but the methods in which they do this just seem so immoral. Seeing real videos of these people in operation makes them all seem like sociopaths. Why do some of them seem to kill indiscriminately? I understand going toe to toe with military, but there is so much video of them just going after random people. 

Also, when considerably smaller/weaker extremist groups go up against an overwhelmingly more powerful opponent, do they believe they can actually win these wars or are they so dedicated to their cause that they don't care? I'm not necessarily talking about the ISIS, but just extremist groups in general. I know they relatively big for an extremest group.

"This is plainly an act that results from planning and calculation. I was trying to think this through from an ISIS command perspective. When you already have a tough battle running, why start another one? Your problem is the alignment of the Iraqi government, Assad and Iran offering a resupply corridor. Cut that, and you have Assad effectively surrounded. 

Would you do this without an ""understanding"" with the Iraqi military? I think not. How would you test this view?

"These people are indoctrinated. They are literally devoid of independent thought. You cannot re-convert them - the sickening behavior and ideology has been hard-wired over generations. Brainwashed from when they were young. They have their children at their sides as they murder and in the future they will live on to do the same.

There is no negotiating with a force like that, you can't weigh differences because they are merciless. Their consciences are poisoned and they have no moral compass. It's a two way street - you can't force anybody to believe anything. They cannot be shown how close-minded they are. It's good verses evil.

The only thing we can do is work to protect our own countries. One thing that really needs to be addressed is the foreign policy in the UK. Tensions have been building for years at the slack attitude towards violent-prophetic minorities living amongst us. An elderly man got arrested last week for not paying his council tax - meanwhile a hate preacher got given police protection. This is the kind of thing that is slowly leading the UK towards civil war. It's happening all around us and it's bloody frightening.

"Joining the dots - The Carlyle Group, Booz Allen Hamilton, The House of Saud, The Bin Laden Family, the Bush's, Funding and Arming Islamic Terrorism, Iraq and the Clintons. A tale of high level corruption in both parties. http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/06/joining-dots-carlyle-group-booz-allen.html

Background:

Booz Allen Hamilton is owned by the Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group are a private equity fund that invests in lots of companies that make money out of the business of war - arms companies, private spy contractors etc.

Significant board members, associates and ""consultants"" of the Carlyle Group include the Bush's and a who's who of ex US government war hawks for the last 40 years.

Significant investors in the Carlyle group include the House of Saud and the Bin Laden Family.

Saudi Arabia wants a very high oil price - it sells lots of oil.

Saudi Arabia's foreign policy is directed at increasing the price of oil. Mostly this is done by destabilizing and starting conflicts and wars in, other countries that have oil (or are major distribution routes).

This is done in two main ways:-

By funding, arming and recruiting Islamic Extremist terrorists to attack other countries

By bribing the American government to conduct policy that is in the interests of Saudi Arabia and not in the interests of America.

Having a high oil price is directly against the interests of America and it's main export market - Europe. Every $1 rise in the price of a barrel of oil makes everyone in America, Europe and over 99% of the rest of the world poorer (except for the major owners & CEO's of oil companies and oil assets).

Some of the evidence for the involvement of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States in funding, arming, recruiting and supporting Islamic terrorism:-

If the NSA is actually fighting terrorism why haven't they stopped Saudi Arabia, Qatar & Kuwait funding Islamic terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Nusra? http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/06/if-nsa-is-actually-fighting-terrorism.html

Saudi Royal Family and Saudi government involvement in 9/11 http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/06/saudi-royal-family-and-saudi-government.html
 

It is also in the interests of the Carlyle Group, in order to boost their profits, that there is more war, conflict and Islamic terrorism:-

Booz Allen Hamilton and the Carlyle Group: A tale of high level corruption in both parties

The Details of Booz Allen Hamilton, Carlyle and some of the significant players

Lost in the Edward Snowden debate is a critical look at his former employer, the company doing the spying on Americans in the first place: Booz Allen Hamilton.

Booz Allen Hamilton is a government contractor, with 99% of its revenue coming from the US government. Not only does it receive money from the NSA, but also the US Army, US Navy, US Air Force, US Marine Corps, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and ... the IRS. In addition, Booz Allen is heavily connected to the CIA.

Among the individuals involved in running the company, we have:

James Clapper - current Director of National Intelligence (DNI), head of NSA, the man who lied to Congress about the fact that NSA is actively spying on Americans, is a former executive

Mike McConnell - a current executive of the company, had Clapper's job (DNI) during George W. Bush's administration (keep it in the family, eh?) -- he worked for Booz Allen before Bush, then worked for Bush, then back to Booz Allen after Bush

James Woolsey - former CIA Director, current executive (see Jan Helfeld's interview of Mr. Woolsey where it becomes clear that Woolsey has no interest in discussing principles, only war)

Melissa Hathaway - former executive, also worked for McConnell during the Bush administration

Ian Brzezinski - former executive, son of Zbigniew Brzezinski, co-founder of the Trilateral Commission with David Rockefeller, central figure in the NWO crowd, and mastermind of Operation Cyclone

Dov Zakheim - this character is ... unbelievable:

1993 - His company, System Planning Corporation, had a subsidiary called Tridata Corporation, which was the company that ""oversaw"" the investigation of the 1993 WTC bombing

2000 - Part of the neocon Project for a New American Century, he is co-author of ""Rebuilding America's Defenses,"" in which he is credited with the infamous line, ""... some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.""

2001 - He is appointed Comptroller of the Pentagon, in which $2.3 trillion promptly goes ""missing""

2001 - Attack on 9/11 occurs; some people are suspicious of his connections, since his company, SPC, in involved in flight systems capable of remote controlling aircraft, and because he was the guy who leased 32 Boeing 767 aircraft to McDill Air Force Base (2 of the 9/11 aircraft were 767's), and McDill is close to Elgin AFB, which was the location that was to be used if Operation Northwoods had gone live

2004 - Goes to work for Booz Allen Hamilton.

2012 - Advisor on Middle East policy for Mitt Romney campaign (gee ... ya think Romney would have gone to war in the Middle East???)

Booz Allen Hamilton is owned by the Carlyle Group.

One of the big investors in the Carlyle Group was the Bin Laden family in Saudi Arabia. Yeah ... THAT Bin Laden family. And instrumental in being the ""go between"" for Carlyle/Bin Laden was a guy by the name of George H. W. Bush. Maybe you've heard of him? The House of Saud are also big investors in the Carlyle Group.

The CEO of the Carlyle Group (remember, they OWN Booz Allen Hamilton) is Frank Carlucci. Mr. Carlucci has quite a resume:

Nixon Administration - Director of the Office for Economic Opportunity (the ""War on Poverty"" -- and a great place to decide who gets government contracts)

Carter Administration - Deputy Director of the CIA

Reagan Administration - National Security Advisor and Secretary of Defense (Donald Rumsfeld is Carlucci's protege)

He is or has been with the Project for a New American Century and a member of the Board of Trustees for the RAND Corporation, a CIA front that develops policies that the Military Industrial Complex then carries out.

You want a NWO guy? Carlucci is your man. And CEO of Carlyle Group, owner of Booz Allen Hamilton, spying on YOU.

At RAND, his specialty was Middle East policy. What do you know? That was also the specialty of Graham Fuller, CIA guy who was the father-in-law of Ruslan Tsarni, uncle of Tamarlan Tsarnev, suspected Boston bomber.

Speaking of the Boston bombing and Tamarlan Tsarnaev, he had a couple of trips to Russia that made the news. But what did not make the news (in America, but it did in Russia) is that he went there for ""training"" that was funded by the Jamestown Foundation. And what do you know? The Jamestown Foundation (CIA front) has among its past board members none other than Dick Cheney and Marcia Carlucci, wife of Frank Carlucci.

Given all their connections and government contracts, here's an interesting question: Booz Allen Hamilton has not only been involved in spying via the NSA, but they have also received no-bid contracts from the IRS. What do they know about the American people via the IRS?
Now, one of the things you will start to see if you look around at some of the big corporations these days is that many of them are involved in what they call ""corporate citizenship"" or something similar. What this means at the surface level is they are being ""good citizens"" by donating to charity. But when you go beyond the surface, you will see something else going on.
Booz Allen Hamilton donates money to the Clinton Global Initiative. The CGI is a part of the Clinton Foundation (yeah, THAT Clinton).

The Clinton Foundation has been implicated in bribery on an international level. Clinton gave himself a special little privilege while president wherein he exempted the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation from the normal rules of disclosure regarding publicly listing who its contributors were. It's a secret foundation. And it has over $200 million in assets now. And is alleged to be used as a way to funnel black money from corrupt governments around the world for behind-the-scenes deals like special oil contracts, arms dealing, US government foreign aid deals, whatever.

So folks, what you are not being told in the media about Edward Snowden's former company is that it is not only spying on you, but it is probably checking out your tax returns, too, and also receiving some of your tax money in government contracts, which it then funnels to CIA-connected/Military Industrial Complex-connected/NWO-connected individuals and organizations.

Something like this: Your tax money (taken from you by force) -> IRS -> Booz Allen Hamilton -> Clinton Foundation -> foreign bribes -> more contracts for the Military Industrial Complex -> more spending by foreign governments -> more foreign aid from the US government -> more US government spending -> more taxes needed -> more taxes from YOU.
Oh ... and they are spying on you, too.
But Edward Snowden ... yeah HE is the bad guy here. Uh huh ... move along ... nothing to see here.

It is fucked up."
"What interest does the West have in continuing to prop up a nearly century old Sykes-Picot agreement? ""Iraq"" is a British and French idea from the WWI era.  Sunnis and Shia have a complex and too often violent relationship going back to the Umyyad Caliphate.  Western military intervention does not have a positive track record in this region."
I wish Saddam had just let in the damn inspectors.
As a Veteran of OIF I would just like to say what a fucking mess. What a motherfucking mess. I honestly don't know what else to say about this situation. 
Am I the only one full of what regarding the fact that the iraqis are asking for American intervention when it is pretty safe to say that American intervention is to blame for the instability/sectarian conflict in Iraq?
This is what happens when you pluck out a dictator and create a massive power vacuum. 
"[This video](https://ia801509.us.archive.org/18/items/al_saleel_4/SaleelSawarim.mp4) is doing the rounds but I feel it's essential watching to get on top of what's going on. Please before you click it's NSFL with executions by the dozen, beheadings, murderous raids and lots more pretty awful content. They clearly have a precise agenda and towards the end of the film they are hunting down Government members/friends/soldiers from the current regime and simply executing them without any qualms, sometimes in their own houses. What's really saddening is that they are armed to the teeth with US/Allied equipment and today I hear they have helicopters, Abrahm's tanks and enough ammo to murder the entire population.

You won't be seeing any of this on the news tonight. Amazing what religious belief can do to make a man behave so abhorrently towards his fellow man. Let's not forget this is simply a 1300 year old argument about who should have succeeded Mo after he died. So much death for something so pathetically trivial."
I have the feeling that we need a very strong and charismatic leader who wields enough political and military power - along with a functioning administration - to run Iraq since democracy is clearly not working out for them. Oh wait...
"My **theory** today: **ISIS consists of Saddam's former army who are being primarily funded by the Saudis.**

I mean, Saddam was a Sunni, right? I presume much of his army (which was disbanded by the Bush Administration) were Sunni as well.

Does it not seem possible that after they disbanded, Saddams' former commanders put feelers out round the Sunni world looking for a way to reconstitute their army and found financial backers amongst fellow Sunnis in Saudi Arabia/UAE?

The reason I specifically single out the Saudis/UAE is that the US media has been deafening in its silence in reporting on what the ISIS command structure is, and to me these stories about them being Al Qaeda and being funded by appropriated bank funds seized like a week ago ring completely false. US media has been carrying water for the Saudis for a LONG time now so if they are involved, it makes a certain kind of sense the media would do its best to cover it up.

In any case, this army seems to be having way to much success for some rag-tag group of disaffected youths receiving terrorism training in some desert camp.

Syria update - the Islamic Extremists are losing the war, so Saudi Arabia wants to supply heavy weapons http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/04/syria-update-islamic-extremists-are.html

The results of the US backed funding of Islamic Extremist terrorist groups and the US invasion of Iraq

Iraq has been a bloodbath for a decade, it's economy and infrastructure have been ruined. Over 500,000 Iraqi's have died during the US occupation, millions have been displaced. Numerous major birth defects and other illnesses are being reported due to the US using depleted uranium in Fallujah. The US also used white phosphorus, which is banned as a chemical weapon under the Geneva convention. N.B. Iraq was never ""pacified"" by a troop surge as the Neocons claim. The Sunni's were bribed with billions of US tax dollars to keep quiet for a while - but this bribe money has now dried up.

The CIA engineered civil war in Libya, in support of Islamic Extremists from Benghazi, has turned Libya into a bloodbath with various armed militias shooting each other. It's economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins.

The CIA engineered Syrian civil war has turned Syria into a bloodbath with 140,000 (on both sides) killed. Syria's economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins. Millions have been displaced and have fled as refugees. The Islamic Extremists (which comprise almost all of the actively fighting ""rebels"") have been losing the war against Assad in Syria so they have now turned their attention back to Iraq with some major gains by ISIS including taking over $400m from Iraqi banks (we await further developments).

The US war against Pakistan has killed hundreds of innocent civilians with drone strikes including 170 children.

The civil war in Yemen where the US has used cruise missiles, cluster bombs and drone strikes in support of a corrupt dictator has turned Yemen into a bloodbath.

Boku Haram which is covertly funded and armed by the US proxy Saudi Arabia, via islamic extremists in Libya is murdering christians in Nigeria.

Mali's legitimate government was overthrown in a joint US & French military coup in 2012 to be replaced by a puppet President trained by the US at military bases in the US.

The Afghan poppy crop which had been reduced by 90% with the Taleban's ban in 2000 is now greater than ever. More Afghans are now subject to drugs warlords (of which Karzai & his brother are both major ones). Afghanistan remains a bloodbath and a hot civil war.

A semi stable government in Somalia was overthrown by Ethiopia in a US backed coup. Somalia is in chaos, with elements of this chaos murdering innocent civilians in Kenya.

More than 200 million more people now support Islamic Extremism than they did in 2005.

Ukraine has been turned into a civil war zone by a US engineered illegal Coup D'Etat in Kiev. Ukraine is joining Iraq, Syria and Libya in the utter misery, violence, death and poverty that comes with US ""liberation"".

It wouldn't be quite so bad, if the nett result of all this US mega stupidity wasn't the ruining of the US economy and the very dramatic quickening of the end of the petrodollar system and the end of American hegemony to hand over the reins of power to a SE Asia dominated world, centered on China - with Russia, the Brics, Africa and South America as allies."
"Another aspect of this: ISIS now controls the rivers of Iraq

http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229733.400-china-battles-to-be-first-ecological-civilisation.html#.U5qYmCgueS0"
"If US gets militarily involved to help the Malaki administration - that basically puts us on the same side with the Iranis and on the opposing side of the Saudis and UAE. I presume because Israel has such a raging hard-on against Iran, they will be opposed US acting in tandem with them.

I was a bit surprised the GOP is acting so hawkish on getting militarily involved with this, as they have long set their sights on beating the drums against Iran.

Also, as IMO the GOP wants to run Jeb in 2016 - it does not help his chances if we really get involved in undermining what seem to be Saudi Arabian machinations to topple Maliki."
We will need an operation like the one that defeated the rebel state in Northern Mali to defeat ISIS.

"Does anyone know what the death toll is of this, even just an estimate? I have heard zero information on this."
"Anyone knows what weapons? I have heard everything from armored cars, shoulder missiles to Abrams tanks."
"So prescient from Laleh Khalili:

""The “Mosul miracle,” then, was a blatant case of attempting indirect rule during a conquest, secured through the distribution of imperial largesse and favors. Its relevance to today is only indirect. For where Petraeus failed was in imagining that a conquering military that exploits existing social fissures (ethnic and sectarian) to bolster its own control could also create a national client army ex nihilo. Immediately after leaving Mosul, Petraeus became the commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq, which was tasked with training and equipping the new Iraqi army.""

"To me this is a good time to collect ourselves and figure out what our priorities and strategy should be for the world.  Clearly our current policy has resulted in the flames of conflict spreading instead of retreating.  Syria is choking on chlorine, Ukraine is gearing up for a major civil war, and the efforts of our soldiers in Afghanistan along with Iraq are being erased in the sand soaked with their blood.  We cannot stand idle any longer and we cannot shoot whatever we want on false pretenses.  A new doctrine needs to be organized and put into action to deal with the issues of today.  We honestly need to find out who truly are our friends and potential allies even if they may be greatly misunderstood in today's current politics.  We also must accept that we are not gods, but people and we cannot put out or slow every fire we see; we can only do what we can and we must work to improve ourselves so we can help more people in the future.  We also need to consolidate and focus foreign aid so we don't accidentally bankroll tyrants and terrorists in the haze of poorly judged good intentions.  We also need to recognize that we wield more power than any other nation has on Earth ever.  We have the responsibility to wield and use this power wisely to fight the guerrilla wars of the 21st century.  We need to use the CIA, NSA, and the military in combination to route these bastards so the innocent people of the world can truly live in a more perfect peace.

ISIL has instated 'strict Islamic law' in areas they've conquered but have left the management of those same areas in the hands of locals mostly comprised of ex-Saddam military personnel. 

The political party in power right now in Iraq is Shia as is Iran.  The governing body in Iraq hasn't included their entire population and this has created a group of individuals who are flocking to ISIL.

"I feel sorry for Obama in some ways. If he goes back into Iraq, his legacy will be tarnished forever, and his legacy has taken a battering as it is. On the otherhand, he has nothing to lose as he can't run for a third term. I think he will do what he thinks is right in the end - initial 'no boots on the ground policy' (Drones, missile strikes and fighter jets) and then, if unsuccessful, a small tactical troop intervention  in co-operation with NATO allies. In five-ten years, the press and the people will inevitably call him an 'oil seeking, capitalist, war criminal'."

"I have to ask -- as a citizen of a Western country, why do I care?

I am weary of my country being in a state of constant war. There is a part of me that wants to see the military drawn down, point the guns  outward for a while, and focus on issues at home. 

My understanding of the volatility in the Middle East has much to do about the shadow of Colonialism still playing out to this day. The borders do not make sense. We have Sunni, Shia, and Kurds thrown in together within the borders of Iraq, and they just don't play all that well together. 

I do not have any particular loyalty to any one of those groups. They have different belief systems, and that's ok. 

Why not let the region define what borders best suit the realities on the ground? The realities of the population distribution. Going forward it feels like allowing things to play themselves out might actually lead to an eventual state of equilibrium, and stability, for the region. 

What are some of the deeper issues at play? 

Why should I care?"
"Western countries fear the Islamic states unity. The possession of oil and resources would put them in the driving seat of the worlds power vacuum.

The Western world repetitively attacks this region to make it as unstable as possible to sustain power and influence in the region. Creation of segregation of religious sects and Tribes is one part of the mission for the regions of the middle eastern peninsula.  

I read an newspaper article from a respected British news co. just after the Iraq war, an inquest into a leaked Top Secret mission by the special forces - They would dress up as locals go into areas of different sects and kill people simple put as 'Drive by's' Its crafty and dirty but it did the job. Factions started fighting factions, Suicide bombings. Destabilized communities. What is happening here is the same thing, a Muslim faction starts to take control causes confusion and fear people jump to arms to protect what they never had. America sells more weapons, the poor get killed and the mullahs and factions keep on raging and the oil keeps on flowing. 

This region as we all know, is a key playground for globalization.  Keep the Islamic states unstable. Buy cheap oil so we don't need to use our resources - KEEP the Muslims fighting each other. 

Ask your self a question; Why is our media so interested in this region?  To maintain a lie we've been sold for the last 13 years. THE TERRORIST!

Considering that their military has been treated as at most a slight inconvenience to foreign entry multiple times in the past few decades it is not at all surprising that they will disperse under pressure after their chain of command was broken.
At least the Special Forces seem to be doing a good job. They look decently-trained.

Since when did isis capture taji? I've been hearing that they captured it in the past few hours but certainly not 2 days ago. Still unconfirmed.

"I would point out that you predicted ISIS control of Iraq within a week, 5 days ago, while they are still no closer to Baghdad than they were then."
I doubt it. ISIS would have to be suicidally stupid to attack the Shi'ite holy cities. Iran would intervene directly immediately.
"Just ask yourself...

Where are they getting these weapons?"
"They're spread really thin, without major reinforcements they'll be losing ground really quickly really soon.  They benefit much more by taking territory that is already occupied by those sympathetic to their cause and then holding that territory while looking to their controlled population for recruits and reinforcements.  An attack into Shia areas and attempts at controlling the Shia are going to be much more difficult.

If their leadership is terrible, they'll push deep into Shia areas.  The only strategic victory for them in Baghdad would be a symbolic, successful attack against government members or buildings.  Holding Baghdad would probably be beyond their current capabilities.  Especially because they'll be fighting two fronts:  The Iraqi miltary and the Kurdish military."
"Think back to the revolution in Libya.  The rebels swept across the coast seizing city after city and seemed poised to take the capital.  Then Gadafi's forces struck back and rolled through the same cities and were poised to wipe out the rebels until the U.S. intervened.

Seizing undefended cities is not hard and does indicate military power, it indicates a military vacuum being filled.  ISIS may be a tough military force, but their advances so far do not prove that."

Soldiers serving in Iraq have been saying pretty much since the start that this country won't be stable until something like this runs its course.  There is still far too much outside influence, religious bigotry, lack of education, lack of unification of the country as a whole, and in general simple backwoods hate for Iraq to move forward.  

Even Dr. Martin Luther King reached a point where he felt violence may become an option in America.  His entire peaceful approach has been all but skipped over in the region and it has gone straight to war.  Numerous times over. This is a group of people that simply aren't ready or willing to look past their differences to unite and form a common good.  Even if they were ready for that, there is so much outside influence taking place by countries that stand to gain by an unstable Iraq that it could never take hold.  

It sounds like hate speech when a bunch of 19-25 year old soldiers say, ""This country won't be stable until they have their own revolution"" but tell me it isn't true.  Maybe ISIL, Saudi Arabia, and all their other backers will usher forth a new Sunni regime and we'll be back to our old ways.  Maybe Iran and all of the Shiite clergy throughout Iraq will gather their wits and stamp out this Sunni insurgency in order to rule through Shiite leadership with an iron fist.  Or maybe we'll get some hybrid that is sure to lead us right back to another one of these situations in 5-10 years.   

Either way, it's about time this whole thing plays out, and I think America is about sick enough of these wars to let it do just that.  Who would know those kids who were actually there and have been saying this shit all along were so right.  Nobody wants to give any one of these 20 year old American infantrymen living through the shit any credit for prophetic thoughts, but maybe they've been right all along.  Maybe all those intelligence officers, CIA operatives, high command personnel, etc. are wrong.

Why would that be? Russia supports Assad in Syria, and they have there own problems in Chechnya and Dagestan with Islamists trying to create a caliphate. Unless I'm missing something (and there is a good chance I am) Russia have absolutely no reason to support ISIS in any way. On contrary they have all the reasons to oppose them.

"Thank you for this... it's spot on. So many people are trying to frame this as a anti-Bush we never should have invaded thing or an anti-Obama we never should have left thing.

"I don't think it's accurate to say that the U.S. ""has very little to do with this"". In many ways the U.S. set up the dominoes by completely dissolving the previous Iraqi army which was keeping the country together and attempting to replace it with completely new and inexperienced recruits. It was a double wammy. On the one hand the current Iraqi army is not well trained and inexperienced and on the other hand many of the experienced officer and troops of the old Iraqi army after loosing their jobs signed up with ISIL.

Rumsfeld and his associates understood very well that they were doing when they dissolved Iraqi leadership (The army which was established in 1920 and once the 4th most powerful in the world). *At the very least* They set up Iraq for this situation knowing the risk to millions of innocent people and carried on without concern for the lives of anyone (including our troops).

Thank you for this!
"> All of this has led to a large disenfranchised Army (which is still more Sunni then Shia) who made the exact same calculation in 2014 that they made in 2007 - it's better to see the Shia fail, and have war, then be under their subjugation. The problem is that in 2007, Iran wasn't that big of a factor, Syria wasn't on fire, and the US was paying attention. None of those things are true now.

Now -this- is interesting, do you have a source that Sunnis are still a bigger % of the Iraqi national army than Shiites? Because the government is shiite dominated and Iraqi has a Shiite majority."
"> When ISIS came on the scene ... |
> ISIS is not Al Qaeda. |
> The tried the affiliate thing for a bit

Let's not forget that ISIS is a direct evolution of Al-Qaeda in Iraq (est. 2004ish?) / the Mujahideen Shura Council. Just because Abu Bakr had a falling out with ""Al-Qaeda proper"" doesn't necessarily mean that this is a new group. Just making that distinction since they're the same hardliners/Jihadi All-Stars we dealth with in OIF, minus a slight allegience change."
">  ISIS is not Al Qaeda. They tried the affiliate thing for a bit, but their brutality was too much for Al Qaeda, and they got punted. 

I keep seeing this repeated and it needs to be stopped.  This is a propaganda push to make ISIS seem like ""super Al Qaeda"" to appeal to peoples' fears.  

ISIS and Al Qaeda split because of a leadership power struggle, not because they disagreed on methods.  According to Al Qaeda, ISIS just wasn't a team player.

The outrage over ISIS' brutality came from ordinary, moderate Syrian citizens, not from Al Qaeda.  Al Qaeda only chose to fight ISIS in Syria because ISIS wants to be its own power."
"FYI, the Surge did not ""work.""

For one thing, the troop max during the surge was nearly identical to levels it [had already been](http://www.languageandpeace.com/blog/surge.gif).

What really happened was:

* Petraeus actually is a much better General than Casey, who I considered not much more than a sock puppet.
* We started buying the allegiance of Sunnis in the Awakening movement.
* al-Sadr (in part seeing the writing on the wall) declared a ceasefire."
"I think you're generally correct, but I don't think this is a new event. I think this is a conflict that goes back at least to the Iran Iraq war. 

But yes, to blame the US is to ignore the Shia Sunni conflict that has undermined stability in the region for at least the past 35 or so years. "
"Good analysis.  I largely agree.

I would add that the entire situation can be couched in a broader theme throughout the region, from N. Africa to Syria and to the eastern border of Iraq.  This is the end of a 30 year regime cycle.  The bottom line is that, even without US involvement, these dictators were getting old, and with age comes weakness.

It's hard to argue that the Arab Spring was the doing of the US.  I think the situation in Iraq, as you noted, is a result of the situation in Syria, which traces its roots to the Arab Spring--not the US invasion.

What scares me most is the age of the Saudi prince.  If this mess finds its way to the Gulf, oil prices will spike to unseen levels, and then shit gets real."
It has everything to do the US. Tell me where ISIS come from?
I wanted to say the EXACT same thing but couldn't find the world. Very well written sir. My utmost respect for understanding the situation rather than being brain washed by biased media cuz every region that has an independent or dependent media is biased towards that region or its producers.

"How is the ISIS under protection from Russian when Russia is funding Assad? By Russian do mean the States since they are funding anti-Assad forces? I mean there is a direct link between American allies and the ISIS, specifically speaking Qatar & Saudi Arabia. In addition a number of videos show American weapons in the hands of ISIS (TOW Missiles). I know that others could have sold it to them, but that seems more as just channel to get that weapons to ISIS.

When and where was this said? Curious about the context
Americans murdering and lying!? Never!
"No, not at all. What youve got to understand is, Islam spread wide and it spread [fast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate#mediaviewer/File:Mohammad_adil-Rashidun_empire-slide.gif). But while conquest and change of administration can happen quickly, people change much more slowly. 

Societies in a demographic and cultural sense cant change overnight. People tend to forget that places like Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Libya, and Anatolia were all (Eastern) Roman provinces for several centuries right up until the rise of the Caliphate. On the other hand, Persia which was conquered out right was a land of Zoroastrians 'fire worshippers' as it were. While the Qu'ran was being 'revealed', the Persians and Romans were embroiled in [war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_602%E2%80%93628). The Byzantines at this time were getting absolutely dominated, and the Persians had pushed deep into core territories. Meanwhile, in Arabia, the first Muslims (when they numbered in the hundreds if not less) were at conflict with the Pagans of Mecca. In this case, the Pagans were on the side of the Persians to oppose the Muslims who were supporting the monotheistic, orthodox Christians. When defeat seemed imminent, the Pagans were jeering at Muhammad and co. to the extent that: 
>""Look the fire worshipers of Iran are winning victories and the Christian believers in Revelation and Prophethood are being routed everywhere. Likewise, we, the idol worshipers of Arabia, will exterminate you and your religion.""

Thats when surah Rum(Rome) was revealed and made a bold prediction, that the Byzantines would be successful after they are defeated. Incidentally, the Byzantines would go on to pull one of the biggest upsets of that era. But by the end of this, they and the Persians both were exhausted, and the stars just happened to align for the Arabs that were about to emerge. 

The reason I elaborated on the circumstance is because the context is very important. These were two of the world greatest historical empires/regions. They had had states and civilization for a long time. The Arabs are a people who up to this time, had never formed a single state. But with a combination of the exhausted giants, legendary military leadership, and an extremely powerful intrinsic drive to expand, they managed to build the largest empire the world had ever seen. But theres a problem. Now a quarter of humanity lives in the lands youve just conquered. These lands have civil institutions, they have customs, cultures, languages etc. No way you can hold that down if you come in with an extremely aggressive 'my way or the highway' policy. So ultimately, my point isn't wether the Caliphate was accepting and tolerant of native ways of life and customs, what im saying is,  *it had to be*. Why else would the people be ok with it? Due to the tax systems, the state stood to make money either way. As long as the taxes were paid, you are free to live as you were. And I could/can argue that the former Byzantines and Persians preferred the 'new guard' to the old, cus if they didn't, they wouldn't have been complicit with it and so accepting of the new leadership. This is why places like Persia and Egypt didn't become the 90% Muslims as they are today until 7/8 centuries after conquest. If you want an actual historians take, refer to these passages from Hugh, Kennedy's ""The Great Arab Conquests"" 

Chapter 3
>[Speaking on the conquest of Iraq] In field battles at Qādisiya and Jalūlā, and cities like Ctesiphon at Tustar, the Sasanian forces were decisively defeated. With the collapse of the Persian army, the Arabs were prepared to make fairly easy terms with the rest of the population - they did not massacre townspeople and villagers, they did not seize their houses or their lands, they did not interfere with their religions and customs, they did not even settle among them. They demanded only that taxes be paid and that the people did not aid their enemies. Whether the taxes were higher or lower than they had been under the previous administration we cannot tell, but we can be certain that most people in Iraq thought that it was a bargain well worth making.""

Chapter 12
> ""In many ways acceptance of Muslim rule was the result of Muslim policy towards the enemy: it was almost always preferable to surrender to the invaders and to make terms and pay the taxes than to resist to the last. The Islamization and Arabization that followed conquest over the next two or three centuries would not have occurred if political conquest had not already succeeded, but they were not a direct and inevitable consequence of that conquest. Instead, it was a gradual, almost entirely peaceful result of the fact that more and more people wanted to identify with and participate in the dominant culture of their time.""

One final thing I would like to add, that really sets the original 3 Caliphates apart from a group like ISIS, is an example and directive set in the Hadith or life stories of the Prophet Muhammad. His Companions, the Shahabah were very adamant in their ways and wanted to spread Islam in an aggressive, ""written in stone"" manner. The Prophet explicitly tells them not to spread the religion in such a way that drives the people away from it. Everything must be handled in context, with understanding, and with mercy above all other principles, because their God is a merciful one.  Obviously, what with 500,000 people fleeing Mosul, ISIS doesn't seem to get the message that their way of doing things isn't something that is acceptable either in the religion or in society. I know this was kind of lengthy, it has to be to properly get the ideas across, but I hope you can see the difference in thinking and action of the Caliphates and a group like ISIS, and how the latter's deeds are deviant from the example of the Prophet who's mission they claim to represent. ISIS lacks knowledge and they lack empathy, and this is fatal. Or maybe they have both and the whole ""restore the glory of the caliphate"" is a war cry and means of gathering the support of a distraught, miserable populace. Maybe their actual purpose and intentions are far more insidious. Who knows?

"I'm not sure that this exactly ""our actions,"" given that the current group involved in the fighting is primarily a product of Jihadist fighting in Syria (which wasn't initially funded or supported in any fashion by the West). Futhermore, at the time of US withdrawal Iraq was a fairly stable country and its only thanks to Al-Maliki's poor governance and hamfisted response to opposition that has caused this current crisis. 

Would this have happened if we left Saddam in power? It is impossible to tell. People didn't think it was possible for there to be credible opposition to Assad's regime either. I think it's a bit of a fallacy to attribute everything to Western malfeasance or incompetence.  "
"""Better a thousand years of tyranny then a day of anarchy"". Is an Islamic proverb that comes to mind."
"Never forget about what people did after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. People RUN to the most well organized form of community (i.e. social framework) during the times everything goes to shit. In this case for Empire, the Roman Catholic Church was a well structured political framework to which most looked to for guidance in a completely chaotic vacuum of weak and corrupt elite. The same is situation is occurring in Iraq. The U.S. has been supporting a sebaceous cyst overwhelmed with pus so deep that when everything collapses like a caldera the only solution is for the cavernous wound to fill itself with the blood of the many. Sadly those who will give their blood are motivated for the right reasons but ultimately giving everything for the wrong people. Whether we choose to believe it, deep down we all know the leaders of ISIS are legitimized psychopaths with an obsession for their religion. The large consensus among the extremist leadership for how society should be organized is ancient and we need to do what we must to help the pissed off, voiceless, and forgotten silent majority of boys benefit humanity, not to the few who will profit or build on the graves and bones of people who want justice. 

People have far too long looked forward for a cause that leads to more of the same. Human beings are the most important resource we have. The few are powerless without a loyal base of followers. For christ sake we live in a time when we can communicate across the surface of a large rock that can evoke a meaning of either love or hate. Vitriol exacerbates our difference to such a degree that it is seemingly impossible to grow out of thinking about one group needing to fight against another. Are individuals the only entity capable of logic? Are we in a state of perpetual chaos against order that will end when this our understanding of the conscious organization of the universe (us) decides to finally destroy the legacies of our ancestors, inherit challenges we have overcome, and erase all evidence of the fact that we existed? Will another civilization much like ourselves, desperate not to be alone, discover our cries for companionship only to look where the signal was sent and see us destroy ourselves from within? I'm disappointed with being a human but thrilled at the same time. We are capable of nothing short of miracles, vastly making our predecessors obsolete. With our outlook of our individualist drive fixated on the belief that we can do better and be better tomorrow than we are today, it is a wonder to me that no country exists where the meaning of the statement is practiced and championed by all. 

My wish is that I am cynical. If every advancement in our ability to communicate with one to another brings the inevitable successors to the center of attention in a world dominated by their mothers' and fathers' then we really are better today than we were yesterday. My optimistic view of our role in the future we will be forced to consume ourselves in is ensuring social changes happen with shorter intervals, more progressive tangible improvements, empathy and understanding for others in a way that fosters individuals independent of the idea of ""normal,"" and above all absolute sincere desire to be humble to others. I'll finish by stating that I may think I am correct, but I know in the long term I am not. Nobody will be correct forever. If ideas emanate from a familiar source (absolutely-equal for each generation's desire to improve) during each emergence of the new, then perhaps we are creatures gifted with the ability to dynamically evolve our conscious interpretation of reality due a bizarre yet truly unique birth that is relatively premature compared to all other animals. Instead of waiting for change on a molecular level we are exposed to learning about change from the moment our brains are developing. 

We are the thinking collection of infinitesimally miniature ejaculate of whatever our universe was before its existence (assuming there was a beginning at all) to such a degree that we have somehow orchestrated subconsciously and consciously the forced obligation to progress. Young men old enough to be called boys in Iraq deserve the society they help create. To the sadness of progress women will probably still be subject to oppression. These boys could become the men who give birth to the generation that desire a best friend and partner and not a tool to continue a social order reliant on a religion of Abrahamic origins. These boys deserve better. Iraq deserves better. Civilization deserves better."
"The real irony is that *this is almost EXACTLY what we did in Iran before Iraq!!!* We took out a secular democracy that wasn't convenient to us and paved the way for Islamist extremists to eventually take control. 

We have essentially spent the last century acting as an enzyme to the destabilization of the entire region (and sending our military and secret services into many others), all the while making decisions based primarily on what was most profitable for a tiny corporate elite. The number of innocent lives we've jeopardized through our imperial meddling and pro-capitalist world-shaping is beyond inestimable. Our leaders have fucked up colossally and there's no sign that they will *ever* change course unless we demand it."
"Yeah, in fact Saddam's ba'ath government spent some time fighting the anti-Western Khomeini after the 1979 Iranian revolution. What we say compared to what we do are two different worlds"
">There's a twisted irony

I don't know about that - since the ACTUAL reasons we invaded/occupied were almost certainly not those that were stated."
"Actually, there is also a factor that a lot of the ISIS guys were aligned with Saddam, so in another way, they are just trying to take back what was theirs before we overthrew them."
Saddam would never have let this happen ... sadly.
Our reason was WMD. And that is notirony
USA never linked Saddam to Islamic Extremism. They falsely accused him of having WMD's.
Iraq had a secular government in 2003?
"We had no business being there in the first place. Bush and Cheney said there were weapons of mass destruction and we sent troops there. By the time we figured out there were no weapons, we were in too deep and continued with the plan to hang Sadaam Husein. 
Yes, it is very ironic that we overthrew a government because we believed it was led by Islamic extremists, and now they appear to be the ones gaining the upper hand because of what we did.
IIRC; the Iraqui people were perfectly content with Husein, and his hanging was mostly attended by American soldiers."
"Iraq was more than an islamic extremist, he was relatively not extreme as regards sharia law etc... but was sunni.  However he had already launched several reckless wars, used WMDs even if not in possesion, and the sanctions in place as a result of the gulf war were being evaporated.

So Saddam was really dangerous to have in power.  I do not know why it is insisted that Iraq not divide into sunni and shia provinces, well I kind of do, that it benefits the saudis as well as the US to have the nation unified.  But their are many extreme groups there and it is inevitable that the most violent/extreme will gain power unless the west assists in maintaing order to some degree.

The way the nation was structured I don't think was ideal and I don't think it was ideal to have a complete withdrawl of troops."
This is entirely incorrect.  Saddam went down and his country got freedom because of the prospect he had WMD's. You suffer from a revisionist form of history. This sort of supple recollection is exactly what will supply the will for future mobilizations. 
Who could have seen it?  Any expert you asked. 
"Yah, they'd be better off still under Saddam."
I remember reading about this fact as a kid in Richard Clarke's *Against All Enemies*
"What do you know? When you invade a country on false premises of WMD, execute the strongman in charge leading to a power vacuum and sectarian war, then withdraw your troops ten years later after wasting trillions of dollars and thousands of lives, the corrupt government you propped up isn't stable enough to repel a gang of bandits?

HOW could that be?! I just watched Fox News, good ol' Megyn Kelly, and this is definitely Barack Hussein Obama's fault! American troops should stay in Iraq for at least another decade, maybe five or six, and he's taking them out. No good!"
And now we see why traditionally the US favored installing puppet dictators in countries where we had contributed to the overthrow of the government. 
Does this mean that effectively it was all in vain?
I'd say they were all along. 
The fact that Muslims can't get along isn't Americas fault. This has been their own problem since the founding of their religion.

The results of the US backed funding of Islamic Extremist terrorist groups and the US invasion of Iraq

Iraq has been a bloodbath for a decade, it's economy and infrastructure have been ruined. Over 500,000 Iraqi's have died during the US occupation, millions have been displaced. Numerous major birth defects and other illnesses are being reported due to the US using depleted uranium in Fallujah. The US also used white phosphorus, which is banned as a chemical weapon under the Geneva convention. N.B. Iraq was never ""pacified"" by a troop surge as the Neocons claim. The Sunni's were bribed with billions of US tax dollars to keep quiet for a while - but this bribe money has now dried up.

The CIA engineered civil war in Libya, in support of Islamic Extremists from Benghazi, has turned Libya into a bloodbath with various armed militias shooting each other. It's economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins.

The CIA engineered Syrian civil war has turned Syria into a bloodbath with 140,000 (on both sides) killed. Syria's economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins. Millions have been displaced and have fled as refugees. The Islamic Extremists (which comprise almost all of the actively fighting ""rebels"") have been losing the war against Assad in Syria so they have now turned their attention back to Iraq with some major gains by ISIS including taking over $400m from Iraqi banks (we await further developments).

The US war against Pakistan has killed hundreds of innocent civilians with drone strikes including 170 children.

The civil war in Yemen where the US has used cruise missiles, cluster bombs and drone strikes in support of a corrupt dictator has turned Yemen into a bloodbath.

Boku Haram which is covertly funded and armed by the US proxy Saudi Arabia, via islamic extremists in Libya is murdering christians in Nigeria.

Mali's legitimate government was overthrown in a joint US & French military coup in 2012 to be replaced by a puppet President trained by the US at military bases in the US.

The Afghan poppy crop which had been reduced by 90% with the Taleban's ban in 2000 is now greater than ever. More Afghans are now subject to drugs warlords (of which Karzai & his brother are both major ones). Afghanistan remains a bloodbath and a hot civil war.

A semi stable government in Somalia was overthrown by Ethiopia in a US backed coup. Somalia is in chaos, with elements of this chaos murdering innocent civilians in Kenya.

More than 200 million more people now support Islamic Extremism than they did in 2005.

Ukraine has been turned into a civil war zone by a US engineered illegal Coup D'Etat in Kiev. Ukraine is joining Iraq, Syria and Libya in the utter misery, violence, death and poverty that comes with US ""liberation"".

It wouldn't be quite so bad, if the nett result of all this US mega stupidity wasn't the ruining of the US economy and the very dramatic quickening of the end of the petrodollar system and the end of American hegemony to hand over the reins of power to a SE Asia dominated world, centered on China - with Russia, the Brics, Africa and South America as allies. "
"It's not about ""us"", or even the US. This is a domestic matter. My guess is that the mainly Sunni army has conspired with ISIS to overthrow the Shia government. That virtually writes off Assad through encirclement and with him the Shia in the North. That leaves Iran...  And, separately, Turkey.

It reportedly cost $750 million... and now it might end up destroyed before the week is done.
I guarantee that NAVCENT/C5F is not having the best of days.
The US military is already planning an evacuation. My guess is they'll deploy a limited amount of troops inside the embassy to keep the lunatics out and then go back and forth between there and Kuwait Saigon-style. 
"This map needs updating, ISIS is fighting soldiers in cities as close to Baghdad as Taji (from the north) and there is fighting surrounding the city of Kirkuk between ISIS and KRG."
">will they ever give it back?

Probably not. And frankly, I can't blame them. Looking at the state of Iraq for the past 10 years, separatism is a totally rational response. "

"Yeah, would splitting up Iraq, Syria and (potentially) parts of Turkey (though the PKK has calmed down a bit recently) into separate Kurdish, Sunni and Shia states be that bad an idea? Kind of like the Balkans. Self-determination and clearly agreed borders might help the whole thing calm down and be beneficial for long term peace."
"They're probably going to take mosul and then negotiate for independence. They'll probably get it too.

The kurds are looking to be this war's only winners."
Iran isn't going to fight peshmerga because they want good relations with the KRG.... it's a pointless hypothetical
"The country is in turmoil and all anyone cares about is whether kurds will give back Kirkuk or not :/ they did not steal it, they were simply defending and now they have pressed forward towards protecting baghdad. I'm kurdish btw."
"Present borders in the Middle East were cut out by Western powers. They, like most borders, do not match up well to the different groups of people living within them.

Kurdish people deserve autonomy, just as all people do.
"
"Bloody hell, they're not hanging around are they. Seem to be taking over the country faster than even the US-led coalition..."
"Because the Kurds are a nation of people who traverse many of the borders in the middle east, and creating a Kurdish state would require taking land from Turkey, a NATO ally. Turkey will never give up the land willingly, and if they form their own state and attempt to take control of their land, we are required by law to defend Turkey.

It's similar to the Crimea situation, except that Ukraine is not part of NATO. If they were, we'd have been obligated to go to war to defend that border, regardless of the wishes of the native people living within those borders."
"I think this experience is going to show further that the Kurds are an active force for stability in Northern Iraq, and a force with some backbone.  Some type of additional support will be forthcoming, maybe quietly to keep the Turks from getting too upset.  Rather that from the US directly more likely via the Iraq central government.  "
"im american and i agree with you, we should give the kurds much more support. I've thought so since 2003 with the beginning of the invasion.  The Kurds should make themselves a state, the Sunnis should make themselves a state, and the Shiites should make themselves a state.   They should all just fast-forwars through the bullshit and just go ahead and demarcate borders, save everyone a bunch of problems. "
"I'll always have respect for the Kurds. Everyone in the region hates them because they're a bunch of separatists, but throughout all this shit they've been the only local force capable of maintaining it's own security while also not giving into complete and total extremism. "
"Some of us do care, but we're just citizens...all the power lies in our government and we see how screwed up our government is.  Hell they gave arms and training to these bastards in Jordan and then sent them into Syria and we continue to back terrorist in Syria.   So blame this on the people in charge - the US,  Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.  They are backing these radical assholes."
"> Why doesn't American media/Americans support the Kurds?

Probably because the Kurds don't really have anything to offer the US in political terms AND possibly because our allies the Turks don't like them."
"America loves underdogs ... until they turn into the Taliban, aka mujaheddin."
Yeah sure. Put Kurds(non arabs) in power in the middle of I don't know ARABIA?

"What is happened is that ISIS is the backbone of the fighters, but a bunch of disgruntled Sunni and pro-Saddam militias are fighting with ISIS. So its not just ISIS, but aligned sunni militias, with ISIS providing the biggest punch. "
"Wow ok - I've been reading on ISIL/ISIS and I also found an article talking about Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri here :
http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/iraq-crisis-saddam-husseins-generals-fighting-jihadist-isis-insurgency-1452365

Which one is it? Baathists or radical islamists?"
Here's a trick I do for news. Any report of news wait maybe a week or two or three before reading  a variety of reports. It helps filter out a lot of the fog of war journalism that happens from anecdotes and hearsay rather than hard information
"Porque no los dos? Militants need skilled ex-Saddam officers and they are happy to join them (if they are Sunnis) because after invasion, USA pissed on Iraq army, discharged everyone and created brand new one (which is now useless)."
Now I hate 3 weeks. 
That's what happens when the Iraqi army drops their weapons at your feet and runs
"If that means chemical weapons, that's bad, if that means things that one needs to be highly trained to use, it probably won't make much of a difference."
I agree the Saudi's are the source of the extremist version of Sunni Islam that has inspired and mobilized people for violence and terrorism. The money may not come from the Saudi gov't but I suspect the gov't at the least turns a blind eye to its subjects funding extremists.   
Most of the 9-11 terrorist attackers were Saudis. But we invaded Iraq.
"The ISIL is what happens when insurgent groups gain strength through victories, where smaller groups merge into larger ones. It's similar to how tribal armies (which is a factor here) form into a more coherent force. 

In this case, though, the ISIL are  also now led by some former Iraqi generals, who helped reorganize their command structure after several years of defeat by the US military and the Awakening Councils. Combat against Assad in Syria has made them more effective, and better armed, too.

It's a pretty good demonstration of how a military force evolves if it lingers around long enough."
"Da3esh is a highly trained international group that is folds more determined on creating this caliphate than al-qaeda.  

ISIL used to be Al-Qaeda in Iraq until this february when they decided to break away.  

ISIL has bean funded by Turkey, The USA, and Saudi-Arabia so that it can overthrow Assads regime in Syria.  With all their weapons, they decided to go into Iraq.  They already controlled half of syria so why the fuck not try to go to Iraq?

 Anbar province is the home for the ISIL members, that is it's capital.  Tuesday, it invaded Mosul and today it got to Tikrit.  By this rate they'll overtake Iraq in a week, however that is not possible.  With Turkey protecting the north and Iran protecting the South and Baghdad, There is no way ISIL can control the whole country, unless they work REALLY hard.  This muddled group of extremists has their own government, own military, and own supporters.  They are basically a Mini Jihadi caliphate at this point.  

God help the people in Iraq, and God damn the Da3esh members.   "
"Western press is calling the attacks the work of ISIS but the real force is former members of Saddam Hussein's army.  Saddam's army had hundreds of thousands of soldiers that were denied positions and opportunities in the new Iraqi regime after being disbanded in 2004 and when the Shia government was installed the dissatisfied Sunni soldiers began forming the Islamic State of Iraq.  

Meanwhile, there was also a coup to overthrow Assad in Syria by several other rebel groups.  If you remember, the US supported the anti-Assad rebels by providing weapons and training.  Well, one of those rebel groups called Jabhat Al-Nusra decided to join forces with the Islamic State of Iraq creating the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

ISIS then used the weapons they received from the US to take over military bases in Iraq... giving them access to all the military weapons and equipment the US gave to the Iraqi government to protect its new Shia regime.

So now ISIS has a large army, *tons* of money, and an arsenal of weapons.  Iraq does have a large military but they're not loyal to their country instead they're divided Shia against Sunni so the conflicts are militias against other militias."
[Pretty good explanation as to why Iraqi forces ran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Hn1GXBrG4&t=5m46s)
"The army is much bigger and has much better weaponry; however, they are not battle-hardened soldiers, but rather regular people looking for jobs, because Saddam's army was disbanded, as they were loyal to him and weren't thought to be trustworthy. Imagine office workers with guns being asked to defend a city from crazy militants...it doesn't matter how many more of them there are: they don't want to die, so they just drop their guns and run.

">I think ISIL is screwed

Granted I only first heard of this organization, like 5 days ago -  but I tend to agree.

I find it hard to believe they have any concept of how to run the nuts and bolts of two large cities. IF they are primarily Syrians, I doubt the native population will be very cooperative in obeying their orders. At least when the US occupied Iraq they could wave cash in people's faces or at least the HOPE of cash.

Afghanistan is mostly villages - where I'm sure it was much easier for the Taliban to send a couple of jeeps full of people to take control of things - but a city is a complex animal."

"The list of names of all those who have not attended need to be public to the Iraqi people. 
They can't just let them hide while they can blame one guy."
"Uhm, maybe those guys already fled south towards Nassiriya and Basra?"
Well I thought they raided stockpiles of advanced weapons the US had sold to the Iraqi military. I would pretty much expect them to have all sorts of fun toys right now...and millions of dollars from the banks they also raided. How fun. We can forget about Ukraine for a while.
"Think that's scary watch some if ISIS's propaganda videos. They film themselves murdering off duty Iraq Security Forces and police along with their wives and children and brag about how much good they're doing. And they're not just your run of the mill insurgents, these guys are well trained and very well equipped. They could end up taking over a lot more of Iraq and Syria very soon"
That might have something to do with Donald Rumsfeld's decision to completely dissolve the Iraqi army after the 2nd gulf war. 
"There is a good possibility that Iran might get involved over there. After Saddam fell, Iraq turned from Iran's worst enemy into one of its closest allies. Their proxy group from Lebanon, Hezbollah, is stretched quite thin in Syria fighting the same terrorist group (ISIS/ISIL). The Revolutionary Guard might have to step in if this is not halted. 

I wonder what Sadyr and the Mahdi Army will do as well, they are a quite powerful Shiite militia in Iraq. "
"Stand for nothing , fall for everything. "

"> The question remains, where did all of these weapons come from, Libya perhaps... are some of the arms, also from the Syrian Terrorist that Obama is arming?

From what I've been hearing, most of the weapons they are using are remains from what they've captured from the SAA in Syria. I mean, just look at their gear it's all typical terrorist stuff - Kalashnikovs, RPGs, Toyota trucks.. from the footage *I've* seen at least, it's not US gear."
"Obama is not arming the extremists in Syria, you need to get your facts straight. He is arming the FSA, the original rebel group, whom are now at WAR with both the extremists as well as Assad. 

When senior FSA officers started getting assassinated by ISIS and Al Nusra over a year ago, the FSA declared war against them, and they are losing. The extremists are very well funded and well trained, with their funding coming from Qatar and Saudi Arabia. 

The crazy part is that even Al Qaeda broke ties with ISIS, labeling them ""too extreme"". Currently, Al Nusra, allied with the Islamic Front are fighting the ISIS after Zawahiri gave ISIS the boot. 

Syria is an utter mess right now, the extremists, especially ISIS have gained too much power and strength. Even some fringe FSA brigades have joined Al Nusra in fighting them, and ended up disbanding the FSA and joining either Al Nusra or the Islamic Front. 

The FSA is a moderate rebel group, composed of both regular Syrian civilians wanting to oust Assad for his brutal crackdown on unarmed and peaceful protestors, as well as many defected members of the SAA, who refused orders from Assad to murder civilians. A lot of them are fleeing, as they cannot face both Assad and the extremists when all they have in their arsenal is mainly small arms. "

"I tend to agree with that assessment but I think the gains they made in the last few days (monetarily and equipment wise) can very possibly mean that the tide in Syria turns once again towards the Anti-Assad groups.

"ISIS would have zero support in Kurdish territory, and I would expect they're aware of that and aren't going to press their luck hard there.

Peshmerga have the advantage of having a decades long history of fighting guerrilla conflict. And they're fighting on their home turf (if ISIS is advancing, not if they agree to try to push them out of other areas) for their own people. Soldiers don't run from battle very often when it's *their* family who those attackers are coming after.

They're not really equipped for open war against a conventional military, but ISIS is a guerrilla force primarily. Even if they loot equipment, they're not going to be able to stage, maintain, organize, etc it to make it particularly effective.

In short, I'm not sure about their effectiveness for trying to push ISIS out of other parts of Iraq, but I would be pretty confident that they are not going to lose territory to them. Ironically, if one good thing might come out of all this....it *might* get the Kurds and Turks to get on slightly better terms."
"I'd imagine the Kurds will keep ISIS out of their territory without too much effort. The Syrian Kurds have been fighting ISIS for a good while now and have done very well against them. I have faith in the Iraqi Kurds to do the same.

But the Iraqi government might have offer some incentives to get them to push out from their territory. Defending Iraqi Kurdistan would be their top priority.

Edit: In terms of weaponry the Peshmerga seem to have fairly old cold war era equipment and some users over in /r/syriancivilwar seem a bit concerned over their equipment. The Iraqi army is much better equipped than the Kurds. And if ISIS captures much equipment it could get tricky. But in terms of resolve I'd say the Kurds have the advantage there. They also have been offered support from the PKK and YPG though the YPG is in no state to lend troops or equipment and the Iraqi Kurdish government probably doesn't want the PKK in their area.

"You know, many Americans would agree with the majority of your post, but it also speaks of a general ignorance of America that undercuts the point you're trying to make.

It seems that you, and many others, believe that the general American populace exerts a great deal of control over its government. In reality, that is less and less true every day. The US government is controlled largely by entities over which the average American has no influence over, and which are a detriment to our society as well as others around the world.

You're absolutely correct that the US government, military, and business interests do not learn from the past. We have 'intervened' and caused catastrophic failure to so many functioning, peaceful representative governments that it's difficult to believe we still pursue that course of action. We've sanctioned mass killings, brutal regimes, and we're currently working very hard to strip freedoms at every level, at home and abroad. But again, you misunderstand the way American government works and is controlled. You must understand that the very rhetoric we're hated for - freedom above all, etc - has long since lost its credibility, if it ever was there. 

Many people have found great freedom in our country, but there is no way that number is higher than those we've negatively impacted around the world in Chile, Argentina, Iraq, Iran, and the myriad others over the past 7 decades.

No, Americans are not totally absolved of responsibility for the actions of our government. But the blame needs to be placed on those with undue money, and therefore undue influence, in the US government. Please keep in mind - the American 'freedom' rhetoric is a very effective communication, but it is not very accurate. more than 1 in 100 Americans are in prison, the vast majority black or hispanic, poor, and serving time for nonviolent offenses. 

All your criticisms of America are pretty spot-on, but you must understand that at this point calling our government 'representative' is very inaccurate, moreso the higher the position of the office held."

"It's eerily reminiscent of Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge weren't as strong until the US decided to carpet bomb their opponents, virtually wiping out most of the Khmer Rouge's opposition and allowing them to take control. Ultimately resulting in millions of Cambodians dead under Pol Pot's totalitarian despotic rule. The ISIS are just as radial, despotic and totalitarian in their conduct as the Khmer Rouge, though obvious they're ideologically opposed. "

"The problem is not right now - now is set in stone.

The problem will be tomorrow, when whole cities die under sieges and mass-beheadings. The problem is when thee guys actually use the chemical weapons strewn around Syria like candy. 
"
"On the last point, ISIS aren't smaller or weaker. This is a battle hardened group that, while outnumbered, have carved out a bit of Syria for themselves and have sent the Iraqi army running alongside an immense amount of civilians. They've done it exceptionally quickly and a lot of the gains appear to be based on reputation - yes, they've been taking Sunni areas but the vast gains of late show more that ISIS are more formidable than the Iraqi security forces than that ISIS are just steamrollering a friendly area.

You get a small amount of elite fighters against a large amount of fairly green troops and this ends up happening. Probably the biggest threat to ISIS are the Kurds rather than the Iraqi military. 

So dedication to the cause isn't so much a factor for ISIS as momentum, etc probably tips the balance in their favour unless the West intervene. Which they have to and which, thankfully, it seems Obama is looking at doing.

BTW, I was against the 2003 war in Iraq. Intervention in that case was morally wrong, but ISIS are far more dangerous than any threat faced then."

"An organisation calling themselves the ""Islamic State of Iraq and Syria"" (ISIS), who were founded shortly after the 2003 Iraq Invasion and who want to establish a new Islamic Caliphate, have taken over territory in Northern Iraq. This organisation was once allied with Al-Qaeda, but Al-Qaeda distanced themselves from ISIS because apparently ISIS were too extremist. This organisation is also fighting against Bashar Al-Assad is Syria and also have control over a significant amount of Syrian territory. Ironically, the US may have actually aided in the sudden growth spurt of this organisation as the US is providing assistance to rebels in Syria. The eventual goal of ISIS is to conquer the entire Iraq and Levant region (which includes, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Israel) and establish the ""Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant"" (ISIL). "
"Surprised everyone. My own analysis is that everyone knew Iraq was weak both in military and government but it's apparent those weaknesses were much deeper and problematic than anyone from Academics to politicians realized or were leading on. (at least in the mainstream)

ISIL must have had a good reading on that and launched a strong offensive into Iraq. 

The question is how much of this success is due to panic among the Iraqi military and how much is due to competency on the part of ISIL. 

Iraq's forces are melting away without resistance due to low morale or (worse) sympathy with ISIL (Sunnis in Iraq feel their Shiite government is fucking them over). 

ISIL has just moved into their positions and the sooner they're pushed back the less time they have to entrench themselves. The US is pussy footing, Iran is stepping in to help and the Kurds seem gassed up to go to war (possibly to take parts of Iraq away from the central government they've been arguing over since the invasion). 

Why is this happening now? ISIL probably just saw the opportunity and took it but this seems to have caught everyone off guard. I'd imagine ISIL didn't expect to have such little resistance given what they've faced in Syria. Hopefully, that means they're over extending themselves but if effective counter attacks aren't mounted soon, [Iraq is going to look like this](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a8c_1402490070) for many years to come."
"People who have been watching have known this was coming. Most people just have not been paying attention. Falujah has been in a state of siege more or less since December of 2013.  Iraq has been making repeated requests for the US to bomb ISIS since about this time. 

Behind the scenes in the US, the Obama administration has been caught in a no-win scenario. They do nothing, and either Baghdad will fall (which may be the most merciful thing, at least for a bit) or the Shia death-squads and Moqtada Al-Sadr get involved and you have a civil war that makes Lebanon look mellow, with no US to keep the peace this time. 

On the other hand, if the US bombs, not only does the US get re-entrenched, Obama and Biden look like idiots for not listening to their advisers who predicted this would happen when the US leaves. 

Worse, the US basically declares war on a full scale army (not just a terrorist group) that apparently has chemical weapons, and a deep dislike of any thought after the year 692. The casualties of the Syrian Civil War in 2 years is roughly equal to the number of casualties (verified) in the Iraq Civil war in 6.

"At this point, all the Iraqi's have to do is blame themselves, and their region. The US empowered ISIS, but it did so by failing to respond when Syria crossed the ""red line"".

Al Malaki inherited a stable Iraq, with a working arrangement built between the Sunni's via the Awakaning Council.

This is not correct.  There is no such thing as a homogeneous rebel group in Syria which has morphed into ISIS. There are dozens of factions fighting the Assad regime and they are also fighting each other.  The U.S. did not give weapons to ISIS.  They gave weapons to the FSA which has been in direct combat with ISIS and other extremist militant groups.

"> ISIL isn't the primary force, but instead Bathist and local forces in Iraq make up roughly 75-80% of the forces fighting that have been labelled as 'ISIL' by the media.

THANK YOU - this is sort of what I have suspected ever since this situation came on my radar (although guessed that ISIS itself primarily consisted of ex-Saddam military).

IMO US politicians/media are using the 'terrorist' bogeyman probably to deflect attention away from Saudi/UAE participation in all of this and protect the vast miscalculations of the Bush regime and to an extent Obama's willingness to cover for them."

"You're right...it's not like it's our problem or anything.  Oh wait...yep, yep it is.
"
"I by no means am an expert, but I have been following this kind of closely, I'll try to fill you in.

ISIS started as an insurgency group in Iraq when the US was still occupying the country.  They were pushed out into Syria, where, over the last few years have gained strength and support, partly because they were working with other, more moderate rebel groups, that collectively received international aid (including from the US).  

Recently ISIS has moved back into Iraq.  First they took parts of the country more sympathetic to their beliefs, but now they are moving into other parts of the country, that are less prone to supporting the group.  They initially made quick gains but were eventually slowed by the Iraqi military and Iraqi citizen groups that rallied to resist the advances by ISIS.  

In the last day or two ISIS is reported to have taken control of the biggest oil refinery in the country, a major airport, and, although it may be speculating, execute the judge responsible for sentencing Saddam Hussein to death (ISIS is made up of many people who were loyal to Hussein).  

The US, which in a way supported ISIS while they were in Syria, now is trying to intervene diplomatically and by sending ""advisers"" to Iraq to help train their military and security forces to better resist ISIS."
"The problem with that attitude is it assumes we ever had a viable win state in the first place. We never did, we were supposed to be gone in a month after being greeted as liberators, remember?  The war was pointless the second we invaded.  The only thing staying would have done is increase the body count, to someday end up where we are today.  We gave the military top of the line gear. Gear they are leaving in the street as they surrender and flee.  Just like they surrendered to us forces. Now ISIS is gathering up all that gear."
Just like Vietnam. 
"Two years ago, now, five years from now, it was never going end up good."
"I dont think that was actually Bush's position. Bush, after all, put in place the first SOFA. He just blindly assumed that the US and Iraq would work it out in a way that was reasonable in the future. 

That was the bad mistake. "
You are forgetting about SOFA.  Status of Forces Agreement.  GW Bush agreed that all US Forces would leave Iraq by 12/31/11. If they remained and people were killed troops could be prosecuted by Iraq for war crimes. The war was always for nothing but money and oil.  We never should had invaded Iraq.  Saddam kept a lid on things and now it has exploded.  Why the hell do you think Bush is never heard from and stays home painting pictures of doggies?  The top of the Bush administration created this environment. They committed war crimes.  Blame them.
It was all for nothing from the very beginning and everyone with any intelligence and education told you this from the very beginning. And flag waving right wing idiots like you didn't listen and will never listen and 10 years later you still think you were right.
"I honestly agree with you on this. The entire war was weighed down with antiwar sentiment towards the end, so I guess Obama didn't have a choice. And now with large parts of Iraq descending into chaos, it is easy to see this whole war as pointless. Ultimately I think the ones who will benefit from this the most will be the Kurds, who will no longer have to deal with Baghdad when it comes to oil deals.  "

"""They hate us because of our freedom."" Get the fuck out of here with that bullshit.

America did not create the idea of an Islamic state but we did create extremist rebels, trained them, and armed them. Osama was trained by the CIA and turned against us when we turned against him when it was politically convenient. This is long before 9/11.

The US has a long history of going around the world and training/arming rebel groups to create disorder and unrest in other nations that we leverage to obtain certain goals. It has an equally long history of those groups realizing that the US was playing them and them turning on the US in addition to their original reasons for rebelling."

3. ISIS/ISIL is tough, but they're not immortal. They have enemies completely surrounding them, and nowhere to hide. And if the U.S. ends up going ahead with air/drone strikes, well that won't make things any better for them."

"The world did not accept what happened in Crimea. Russia is still under sanctions for it. Russia got away with it cuz they have nukes, and no one wants to deal with that shit. Iran, isn't that strong. If they tried to absorb 1/3rd of iraq, the mullahs would be getting JDAMs courtesy of the US airforce."
"> Most people in the world agree with the idea of self-determination. A locality has the right to decide for itself what it wants to do. The people of Crimea voted to join Russia and the world (begrudgingly) accepted it as the will of those people living in Crimea to decide their own future.

Well the U.S has interest in Ukraine period. The U.S was caught trying to decide for Crimea and obviously attempted to setup a puppet government. There was also suggestions that the we, the U.S., attempted to do what we do better than everyone else, disrupt a established sovereignty. We had no right to do what we did and neither did Putin. The world & U.S. had no choice, but to accept the people's decision. It's rare to see that in this day and age. 

>So what if a large swath of local citizens in Iraq vote to join Iran? Would the world accept that it's the right of those people to determine for themselves what country they wish to belong to, as the people in Crimea did?

If the southern 1/3 of the country (vast majority Shia) voted to join Iran, would the world allow Iran to expand their borders? 

Simply no. It wouldn't solve anything at all. Those muslims will still fight each other regardless of what happens or changes. Weapons will continue to fall into the wrong hands. Regimes will be overturned with or without us [U.S.] pandering in the region. It's another pointless islam religion war so someone will have to pick a side one way or the other. Both side has extreme members. ISIS is currently getting all of the press and has the most money at the moment.

"no, there are already lots of US weapons that ISIS got in Mosul appearing in Syria. like US humvees and else."

The CIA does initially. They're like a Venture Capital firm in the terrorism business.
"There primary (maybe temporary) goal is to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq and now Syria. They do not show intentions to spread to Baghdad. They don't even recognise Iraq as a legitimate state to fight for, they are redrawing the borders to create their own state with parts of Syria and Iraq."
I see no evidence my earlier hypothesis was not right - that this is the Iraqi army that vanished like ghosts when the US invaded - now that the US is gone they have reformed to take back the country (with some financial  help from Sunni billionaires in other countries).

"There is a big problem with that idea, which is that The U.S economy largely depends on the middle east for crude oil. Not only because the U.S uses so much of it but also because the dollar is tied to it. If the U.S lets them resolve it on their own the U.S loses its leverage to borrow more money from china and because of other factors the world currency would probably turn to the Yuan.

"I posted [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/27z1kx/very_confused_about_situation_in_iraq_here_are_my/) in r/politicaldiscussion the other day - and got a lot of not helpful or semi-helpful replies:

**Very confused about situation in Iraq - here are my questions that I feel US media is not addressing:**

1. Where is the money to bankroll ISIS coming from? Well-armed armies don't spring out of nowhere.

2. Armies are a totally different animal than 'terrorism' - so does this suggest either ISIS has little or no connections to Al Qaeda OR Al Qaeda is abandoning terrorism as a tactic?

3. Combining 1 and 2 - AFAIK the main source of financing for Al Qaeda comes from Saudi Arabia - so does that mean ISIS gets funding from the Saudis?

4. How much of ISIS ability to overtake cities in Iraq is based on cooperation from people in those cities?

5. If Isis is based out of Syria - how can anyone expect that Iraqi civilians are going to put up with taking orders from foreigners with no carrots to offer (as the US held out the carrot of money)? To compare Iraq and Afghanistan (which was taken over by the Taliban) seems far fetched to me because Iraq is a (relatively) far more modernized, urban society.

6. SO - possible sources of funding/support for ISIS: Saudis, UAE, Russia (who had been funding Syrian govt), US Military Contractors (not wanting US to withdraw from Iraq), Westerns who had funded Syrian rebels (they used the arms to establish new territory after not being able to topple Assad?), US govt (A group of Iraqis have been siphoning off US funding into a shadow army). I have a hard time believing Iran is in on this as ISIS is Suni and they are Shiite with ties to the current Baghdad govt. Any other ideas?

I am adding one more question that was not in the original post:

- How does Israel fit in with all this?

I agree completely with your sentiment but I hate people who publish allegations with no sources. Could at least dig a little. Sunnis do obviously fund al-Nusra and other groups, not so sure about a direct link to ISIS. It's more likely that ISIS benefits through interactions with other groups that are in fact funded by the Sauds."
"Do you have another source for this? It would seem odd for Gulf states to fund such a destabilizing regional terrorist group. Especially Qatar. I know they've funded certain fundamentalist groups but ISIS was banned from Al Qaeda...

"This isn't about fears. It's about accurately following what is happening. Almost all of Al Qaeda in Iraq was wiped out by the awakening and the surge.

This is also because for the most part what happened in Iraq is still misunderstood by most. The witches brew in Iraq wasn't just Al Qaeda - it was sectarian violence between A group of Shia groups (nicknamed death squads for some reason, instead of terrorists) and Sunni groups (mainly ex-baathist military) went after each other and the civilian populations. While Zarqawi claimed he was part of Al Qaeda, Bin Ladin and Zawahiri were not fans of his, in any way shape or form. While he apparently pledged intelligence, there is a ton of documentary evidence that Bin Ladin and Zawahiri wanted nothing at all to do with him. You can make a very good argument that part of the reason the civil war occurred was that the US was so focused on Al Qaeda, they completely missed what happened with Sadr and the resurgence of the Saddam Fedayeen until way to late.

Indeed it should be noted that the ISIS is growing out from completely different conditions than the original Caliphate. I do think it's a rallying cry (though partially also a reaction to the government). We misjudge the nature of support they have and who's supporting them when we think they are some mythical evil force coming out of the desert. From what I've heard they've learned their lesson and are doing things to reach out to the population (such as making road repairs, making electricity run etc... people will side with them when it comes to this, and they'll be able to recruit more people). This matters, and will make any insurgency stronger. One person interviewed even said that there was more (forget the city?) electricity than in Saddam's day. "

"Al-Qaeda is an entirely Saudi/Yemeni organization. The Taliban came about  in 1996. We ( the United States) assisted Afghan Mujaheddin against the Soviets, many of them were religious..but we supported them under the guise of combating the Soviets.

">you also created the Islamic Militants in the first place with the help of your friends in Pakistani and Saudi Arabian military intelligence

Can we slow down a second? I think you may have misunderstood the situation, or perhaps you've simply never read a book about it. There are scant, if any connections between the CIA and the ""creation of Islamic Militancy"", including Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Al Qaeda is certainly funded by Saudi's, but the Government's direct connections to that funding is hard to prove. On the surface SA is much like Pakistan: it openly opposes Islamic terrorists and supposedly attempts to stop their operations in their countries.

Now, the ISI (Pakistan) most certainly created the Taliban, that much has been proven. They were created to destabilize the Soviet regime which they saw as a huge risk to their own sovereignty at a time when they felt India and the USSR were a little too chummy.

Now, back to the CIA ""creating the Islamic terrorists in the first place"". This is patently false, and most any book you read will tell you that. Joseph Collins ""Understanding the War in Afghanistan"" is a great Primer to read if you want a deeper understanding of how AQ began operating in Afghanistan. If you think all the Muja's were Wahabists, you have another thing coming. Its untrue, unsubstantiated drivel that gets repeated time and time again. Pashtun or Tajik mujahideen were not necessarily interested in the same things we associate with modern day wahabist Islam. Not even close.

The short version of it is this: The armies fighting the Soviets was a combination of Pashtuns, other ethnic groups, Al Qaeda, and what would become the Taliban (i'll just call them that for the sake of clarity). 

AQ Saudis came to Afghanistan as an attempt to gain power through noteriety in war against the soviet. They were never fully integrated into the Pashtun or Tajik resistance groups. They were seen as outsiders with a bizarre and outrageous new form of Islam that the Pashtuns really didn't like or understand. Pashtun culture is distinct from AQ which at the time was primarily Saudi rich boys playing Crusader. The Pashtuns were even distinct from the Taliban who were primarily from a particular part of Pakistan known for it's extremist madrassas. These groups worked together to expel the Soviets, but I assure you they are separate and not necessarily good friends.  Their brief alliance was to expel a larger enemy. When that enemy disappeared, the infighting between the larger Pashtun culture, the taliban, and the rest of the ethnic groups in Afghanistan came out. Al Qaeda aligned itself with the Taliban who were also Islamic extremists, but they were not one and the same at any point.

So when you say that we created Islamic Militants, you're outrageously off base. We supplied weapons to primarily the Tajik and Pashtun warlords (basically to the ""Mujahideen"" as a larger group). The ISI provided training, likely funneling some US funds into that effort, but they weren't training AQ guys, they were training ethnic Tajiks and Pashtuns. Now some weapons may have found their way into the hands of AQ or Taliban fighters but this was at a time when:

A. Those groups already existed, we didn't need to *create* them and;

B. Those groups were fighting a mutual enemy.

Also keep in mind that the CIA did not train these groups in military tactics or ""create them"", we simply gave them stinger missiles and told them how to use them against the Soviet helicopters that were starting to turn the war. All training was done by the ISI, and the training was distributed across multiple ethnic groups most of which were not interested in the Wahabist idealogies of AQ. "
Him specifically? Fuck that guy.
"> created the Islamic Militants in the first place 

It's a complicated thing, but I would guess the main role the west has played in the phenomenon of Islamic extremists has to do with the foundation of Israel as well as the situations with the Palestinians. 

These things are the main unifying factor bringing various Islamic countries together who otherwise would probably spend a lot more time arguing amongst themselves."

"ISIS is not a product of fighting in Syria! The group that is now called ISIS was founded as a response to the US invasion in Iraq in 2003. ISIS moved into Syria. Allegedly first by helping to found JaN. But then they wanted to reunite with JaN which was denied and as a result they moved in their own forces which resulted in an open split between AQ and ISIS. (And the rebels in Syria got plenty support from the West and Turkey.)

Iraq wasn't stable when the US left. The US simply started to pay off the Sunni tribes. The Shia militias stopped their attack due to the US promise to withdraw. Yes Maliki's actions certainly accelerated the escalation again. But claiming that Iraq was fairly stable and things were well is just ridiculously superficial.

"I think people miss this point because of short memory. ISIS is a symptom of tribal warfare in Iraq, but ultimately grew into an actual force during the Syrian conflict. It's really a sign of bad foreign policy by all parties involved that they didn't get that situation under control. The West chose to help out Libya because it was easy, but they should have kept their eyes on the prize in Syria. The longer a civil war, especially one involving religious sects, keeps on going in a country the more likely they will gain strength/resources and spill over into neighbors."
"I think it has a lot to do with ""our actions"" Saddam was a horrible mad man, but he kept Iraq together, when he went, the sectarian strife came to the surface. the US doesn't not understand culture well, and how loyal people are to their own tribes, families ect. they make the same mistakes every where they go.

I guess its still the same old path of divide and conquer.

"Both probably. Most Baathists are Sunni, and they have been marginalized in Iraq by the Shia who gained power after the US invasion. Baathism is dead, but Sunni nationalism is alive and well and the former Baathists are the logical leaders for ISIL. Powerful in reputation and their communities but marginalized by the Baghdad government, they have been fighting since 2002."
"Yeah, that is the guy I was reading about, apparantly he was high up on the US wanted list in Iraq but got away. There was an interview in an english newspaper with one of Saddams daughters who also claimed that it was Baathist forces that were on the move."

"Iirc, a few minor princes had accidents after 9/11. Saudi Arabia does not really have a modern state entity. It is an absolute monarchy with thousands of princes and closely related oligarchs who basically live lawlessly on what would be state oil money. As long as they don't upset the senior princes or king, they can buy their way out of trouble abroad and are immune from the tiny bit of Saudi civil law."
"Last time I checked we invaded Afghanistan in direct retaliation to 9/11, not Iraq. Al-Queda was in Afghanistan at the time, protected by the Taliban. We invaded Iraq two years later for multiple reasons, but mainly for the WMD we thought were there. The Saudi government exiled Bin Laden. Why would we attack them lol?"
"In addition to that training you have an effect where once the ball gets rolling and enough cities fall to them, the defending forces of the next town simply don't want to get involved. There will be minor resistance, but not enough to stop them."
"The numbers in the Iraq Army are very impressive (Active: 271,500, Reserve: 528,500, Total: 800,000.  vs ~10,000 ISIS.  But numbers are never the whole story.  The ISIS troops are religiously motivated and very violent.  The Iraq military is disorganized and critically lacks the will to fight.  So the Iraq Army 'melts away' when force is applied.  The US was there over 10 years training, but you can't give someone else the will to fight.  "

Matter fact you'd get shunned for stating that it is a part of Iraq. The same issue goes for Baghdad, they'd never accept the Kurds to be their own country (whether Shia or Sunni this is the only thing they agree on); relatively speaking the regions around the Green Zone are safe with the occasional shower of missiles every couple of Tuesdays, but going out driving in a car is the worst of all, I depended on a sygic maps, and let me tell you it was like guessing where you'd hide. If you enter into Shia sectors you're fine but get this awkward feeling that everyone is staring at you ( probably cuz they're), in the Sunni walled sectors you're just asking to be killed. Looking at the whole situation they just don't stand each other (Fundematelly since each has a rooted enmity that goes back to the prime time of Islam), and each resort to rather an unusually way of solving their issues, Shias used to have militias which they forced to go dormant, and sunni's long for the past of Saddam's glory. Out of experience many families are FORCED to side with either Sunni or Shia to keep their families safe, they are not sectarine but you must understand that once you've a family to protect, you won't risk by being ""right"" or even just, people might get beheaded right in your street and you're supposed to be happy and cheering for them, or face the same fate.

"Okay wow I am really not super well read up on this.

BUT! I did find an a document published by the CSIS that talks about the situation in Iraq (circa 2012) while looking for information to prove to you that America is to blame more than any other party.

In their report, the authors state that America invaded, removed the government that was in place (not arguing for or against it just the facts here) and proceeded to ignite a five year Sunni-Shi-ite civil war all the while failing to have any real plan to build a stable, functioning nation. This can be attributed the world consequences of their invasion under false pretenses which they did not anticipated in addition to those which they did. 

You can say I read what I wanted to read from the piece but all I want to say is that one would have to have been well-educated by to say that the USA has no share in the blame for what's going on in Iraq right now. Yes, there are, of course other people to blame but that does not absolve America of their role."
You're right how could the invading country that reignited sectarian violence amounting to an all out civil war be to blame for destabilizing a country? How could I *possibly* be so un-patriotic?

Saddam was not a religious extremist, and I presume all this talk of ISIS ""Jihad"" and being linked to Al Qaeda is a fabrication (some of it probably coming from dishonest ISIS propaganda itself intended to mislead).

It would make sense to me that Al Douri is taking advantage of anti-Shiite sentiment in the Sunni world to garner funds - but that this is almost totally a power grab from the late dictator's circle that is primarily politically motivated.

Yes, religion and politics often get intertwined. People feeling under threat will often retreat into religious/tribal affiliations. But in this case it does seem 'faith' is just a pretext for the need by Saddam's former military for political and financial bases of power."

The NSA's Mass Surveillance programs are only useful to the government - they make everyone else LESS SAFE http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-nsas-mass-surveillance-programs-are.html

"No, but to the turkish army. The ISIS will be the reason for a military action"
"Actually, ISIS would have been sponsored by Saddam, just like the Fedayeen where. The probably would not have gone into Iraq, but what they have done in Iraq is a pitance next to the death and destruction they are tied up on in Syria.  "
"You need to pay more attention if you think this. Saddam would have co-opted this much earlier (Saddam was a big backer of terrorist groups, and even had one named after him). A chance to destabilize a Shia neighbor? Saddam would have loved that.

There are far too many people in this thread who think Al Qaeda == ISIS or that this is some sort of long running blowback. ISIS is not Al Qaeda in Iraq. That terrorist group was decimated by the Awakening and the Surge. This core of this group really cut it's teeth in Syria, and their core mission has nothing to do with the US (other then to raise money), and everything to do with killing anyone who isn't Sunni in this terrirotiry. These guys have done something al qaeda never managed to do - form a actual militia with a standing army and government. Al Qaeda tried that, but the brutality drove the Sunni into the American Arms, and the Americans managed to keep the Shia and Sunni from killing each other long enough to neutralize the Jihadis. 

These guys are far far more dangerous. They are tempered in the hell that is Syria, and they are willing to do what Al Qaeda failed at doing - deal with backlash from brutality by amping the brutality level. They probably have chemical weapons, they definitely have more technical know how. They have a power vacuum to step into.

"Sounds like a normal war to me, I wonder how many people died in the War on Drugs"
"Actually...there is a slim chance it could, depending upon your view of what constitutes a world war. 

If this turns into an all out religious war between the two factions the US will ultimately be forced to ""choose"" a side. And no doubt given their increasing need to be valued in the international community, Russia could the same with the other side. You start with a proxy war any anything can happen. Additionally, if there is any spill-over to Israel you could see them knee-jerk and start launching a campaign against one side or another. Nothing like the Israelis to galvanize two divergent sides and have them focused on then beating Israel into the ground, which would then invoke a defensive response from the US.

Again, all unlikely scenarios, but possible. It depends upon whether the Iraqi army is actually able to hold back the charge and if they are able to institute some sort of reforms to incorporate Sunnis into real governmental positions of power and influence."
all the world bombs all the shit out of one terrorist group
"ISIS pushes into Turkey and Iran.  Russia sees this as an opportunity to annex the rest of Ukraine.  Terrorists begin to destabilize some of the weaker Eastern European countries and it snowballs.

">Of course, they have their shit in order and probably would be a separate country by now if not for Turkey not liking that idea.

A landlocked country in the middle east, surrounded by enemies? I'm sure that'll work out great."
"The kurds have not forgotten that the US was arming and supporting saddam up to the point at which he decided to start gassing them.  They're also fully aware that the US is a Turkish ally.

Am I the only one who things that Saudi Arabia is behind that because they want the oil of the kurds?

"I have seen an Abrams tank(looking abandoned) in a (will not name) TV news report about Iraq. That's what really bothered me most because even if they have humvees with mounted .50 cal, they are not as formidable as an Abrams tank and just one or 7 of these tanks in formation will surely topple Baghdad."

Actually Turkey and the Kurdish autonomous region are two of the closest allies in that region. Not that that is a hard thing to become since everyone else in that area hates each other. Trade between the Kurdish region and Turkey is double that of all the trade between Turkey and the rest of Iraq at 8 billion and it will grow once Kurdistan starts exporting oil to Turkey.

"There was a broad agreement to get a SOFA that would allow the US To leave some troops - and more importantly - continue to act as a mediator between Shia and Sunni. As Bob Woodward has documented, and is being widely reported now - Obama really wasn't interested. But by not being interested, I dont mean not wanting the SOFA. Obama's advisers felt it was necessary, but Obama was not really interested in being personally involved in negotiation, and delegated it to Biden. 

Biden, who famously said:

""During the conference, Biden proclaimed, “Maliki wants us to stick around because he does not see a future in Iraq otherwise. I’ll bet you my vice presidency Maliki will extend the SOFA (status of forces agreement).” 

Obviously he was wrong. 

The same thing, more or less, happen in Afghanistan as well. Bush was meeting weekly, personally, without any staffs with the leaders of both Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama completely nixed this when he came to office, and it immediately started introducing drift in the relationships between the countries.

"c-span has the only real news left in this country. common news channels are focused on ratings and just deliver fluff for you to inhale. newspapers are just as bad. primary sources are the way to go if you want the best version of the truth. im sick of hearing all these different variations of ""whats happening in Iraq."" think about it, we have been around here in the u.s. for almost 250 years or so. these fuckers have been fighting for thousands of years and i say that we just let them work it out. no danger of nucs there, the recent chemical compound they took over is useless. they have u.s. tech and cant even use it properly. if we let them figure it out themselves we will be in a much better position to be able to align that with u.s. interests. point is, these fucks have been doing their religious and cultural fighting for  every. we cannot help them anymore. if, and thats a big IF, isis is able to take control a baghdad then the surrounding regions, we will see ourselves priming the ""big bombs"", and will end up starting the biggest insurgent war this planet has ever seen. then you will truly see some soldier death numbers rise again.

my solution to all this is toset up enough proxies around the world to buy oil from, while fixing out alternative energy situation here at home. These dumb fucks will eventually kill each other, or one side will kill the others. eventually order will prevail and Iraq will become stable again.

another option is to divide that fuckin sand pit into 3 different countries; one for the Kurds, Sunni, and Shiites each with their own military, economy, and laws. This could be done relatively easy, diplomatically, and with incentives to help finalize the deal.

The group was composed of and supported by a variety of insurgent groups, including its predecessor organisation, the Mujahideen Shura Council, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, Jaysh al-Fatiheen, Jund al-Sahaba, Katbiyan Ansar Al-Tawhid wal Sunnah, Jeish al-Taiifa al-Mansoura, etc., and other clans whose population profess Sunni Islam. It aimed to establish a caliphate in the Sunni majority regions of Iraq, later expanding this to include Syria. In February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties to ISIL.[27]**

True but actually Obama did not adhere to that time line. He went way beyond the status of forces agreement deadline and didn't leave until Iraq literally kicked us out. 
Implementing shitty plans pushed by the previous administration isn't an excuse.  Its just another sign that Obama doesn't know dick about foreign policy.
"Well when the entire world is screaming at Bush to get troops off the ground in Iraq, he had no choice.  We cant just pin this on Bush.  It was the pressure of the world media, us citizens, etc.. to get out of Iraq.  Setting any timetable in war torn region was never a good idea.  "

Iran has been promoting violence and terrorism across the middle east which results in an equivalent response from the various sunni factions.

A dictatorial shia Iran meddeling in iraq, syria, lebanon, ensures the status quo.  Iraq cannot stabalize with it's neighbor supporting terrorism.  The result will either be Iranian dominance of the country, or a counter insurgency dominance of some form of sunni terrorists/dictators.

I read that Iraqi soldiers were ordered to surrender.
Surely there is some sort of chain of command. If they were not prepared for the loss of generals then there are even bigger issues.

Even an army of cowards fighting like rats would've put off a fight, but not if HQ command surrenders on the spot."
"I edited it, it should be clearer now."
"The soldiers still should have held their positions, instead of abandoning 2 million people to ISIS. They outnumbered them 30:1, they could have put up resistance even without a central command. I imagine Iraqi security forces are pretty lacking in competent NCOs and junior officers capable of stepping up in situations where high command fails. At this point Iraq's best hope at turning the tide against ISIS is the Kurdish Peshmerga. Iraqi Shia may also want to think about bringing back the Mahdi army to defend themselves as well. "

"ISIS is a Sunni coalition.  So they're funded by Saudi Arabia.  Also, you many not understand that when the Syrian gov't cannot control its internal borders, that's an opportunity for a well placed opponent to raise money through coercing the Syrian locals, and having a border base in Syria which Iraq can chase you.  

Oh yeah, did you know that ISIS originated in Iraq, and was in exile in Syria?

Oh yeah, as for 2), Al-Qaeda doesn't exist as an organized threat to US, or even to local interests.  They don't have money, because the US can shut down all their banking, they don't have a base to operate from (Afghanistan), and they've destroyed their welcome in every Sunni sector of the Middle East, by trying to terrorize Sunni localities and attracting unwanted attention from Uncle Sam.  Al Qaeda can't even maintain communications with its branches without US monitoring its scheming.  Al Qaeda is Potemkin threat maintained by the US gov't, in order to justify its foreign excursions, and to spy on its own bosses.

Israel benefits from Syria being cut off from its Iranian benefactor, and having Arabs kill themselves, rather than focusing on Israel as a target.  They're not the mastermind, or calling ISIS's shots, but I'm sure the Mossad will help out ISIS with any intelligence services they may need.

Oh, and you do realize that the big wildcard now is not Iran, ISIS, or Iraq, but what the Turks will do, now that it looks like Kurds may finally establish Kurdistan?  (They just took Kirkuk yesterday.)"

Things were fucked up before, but Bush fomented the tensions and allowed an environment where they could spill over.

"The Quran discourages making a likeness of the human figure, to deter idolatry. But it is for this reason, to prevent idolatry. These artifacts were historical pieces, not something people were worshipping. To break them is really the definition of ignorant extremism.

So when Islamic rulers were arguably the most powerful men on the planet, and had the ability to destroy these things, they elected not to. What does that tell you?

Besides, chaos immediately devolves into tyranny, as the people with the strongest convictions and military capability take it upon themselves to control the situation. And in the case of Iraq, that means the *actual* terrorists that have a possible Islamic state to lose if they lose the war. In the case of Hussein, he had a state to lose if he messed with the US, which was shown by the Gulf War in 1991. The guy was even given chemical weapons by the US in the 80's so as to further their foreign policy. So the incentives are radically different. The radicals in Iraq come from a background that is vehemently anti-US, and they're not afraid to show it. "

The rise of Radical Islam has a large number of factors. This obviously includes animosities based on the dilineation of traditional regional ethnic borders but there are much larger socio-economic questions at play. The Sykes-Picot agreement and other legal documents from the age of imperialism are just indicators of the true root causes.

That must be why mujahideen were secretly trained in Scotland by the SAS, so that the CIA could have plausible deniability, and American interference was less conspicuous. This is straight from the Wikipedia page on Operation Cyclone.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

You're telling half truths to make the CIA and the United States look better than they are. The CIA used the ISI and the GIP as proxies because, indeed, back then a worldwide proxy war against communism legimated alliances with jihadist groups.

"It's becoming a popular ""What If?"" had the US decided to not overthrow Saddam in 2003 and if he was left to rule.  

I'm against the Iraq War, was back then and am today, but I truly believe that had Saddam been left in power the Arab Spring of 2011 would indeed have happened in his country.  It would have been bad, it would basically be Syria's situation given Saddam's notorious history of force against his people.  ISIS would likely be at war with Saddam's military (he would have held onto power if Al-Assad is still able to) and it would be bloody.  This is assuming that Saddam is so busy fighting a civil war in his nation that ISIS slips across the border and joins the Iraqi rebels.

What I'm getting at is the US isn't to blame for ISIS' formation and the Iraq War didn't change things aside from ISIS facing a less effective enemy in Iraq."
"> ISIS is not a product of fighting in Syria!

Well, except for the addition of the last S after the original ISI. Which means that part of the reason why Syria is so fucked now is the Iraq War.

Reminds me of Powell's pottery barn rule: *""You break it, you own it.""* I'm aware that the Iraqi government had asked the US to leave, but still. Those Freedom Fries left an aftertaste."
"Iraq was most certainly not stable and even if US troops stayed there it was still a powder keg of three groups (Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds) who didn't like each other and had history against one another.  ISIS was the spark that hit that powder keg."
I was more referencing the fact that ISIS is doing most of the fighting in Iraq. Since ISIS is a listed terrorist organization I doubt the US government was trying to funnel aid to it.
"I would counter this with the fact that Mubarak, Ghaddafi, and Assad all ""kept [Egypt/Libya/Syria] together"" for years. Ghaddafi was brought down by sectarian violence and Assad's regime almost suffered the same fate. It's impossible to know what would have happened if Saddam were in charge when the Arab Spring came to Iraq. 

ISIS has been able to mount this offensively because it has gained a safe haven in the collapse of Syria. Prior to this ISIS (then Al-Qaeda in Iraq) was largely defeated in Iraq due to the efforts of US and Iraqi security forces. Only the Syrian Civil War and Al-Maliki's misguided strongman rule have directly resulted in the current conflict. If ISIS had launched this offensive in 2010 then perhaps you could attribute it to US action, but frankly the lead up to US withdraw was fairly stable."

An extended siege is unlikely as I explained. ISIS is not going to take Baghdad. But even if it did happen the embassy seems to be designed to withstand a siege long enough for US forces to intervene.

Few laser guided bombs.
An extended siege against a US embassy? That WOULD force the US to do massive bombing campaigns

This is not something that you want on the other side of a war. Whomever is commanding the rebels knows this - he wants to give as little reason as possible for a direct US intervention and just ride out the fact that the US is tired of war."

"there wasn'ta  religious factor in vietnam though. ISIS is sunni, the area around baghdad Shi-ite. Vietnam had a different issue. Many south vietnamese suported the north vietnam forces and the military was a prop up by a hugely disliked 'authoritarian democracy'.

Unlike the northern cities ISIS have taken, the heart of shi'ite iraq is centered around baghdad. "

"I do not see them conquering the Shi'ite parts of Iraq either, given that their policy on Shi'ites basically mirrors Hitler's policy on Jews, I expect the Shi'ites to be *very* motivated to fight.

">Oh you mean this FSA? Top U.S.-Backed Rebel Commander Flees Syria.

And what is the argument here? How does that statement conflict with anything I said in my previous post? I already said: *""When senior FSA officers started getting assassinated by ISIS and Al Nusra over a year ago, the FSA declared war against them, and they are losing.""*

I also said: *""Even some fringe FSA brigades have joined Al Nusra in fighting them, and ended up disbanding the FSA and joining either Al Nusra or the Islamic Front.""*

Of course some of the FSA are fleeing Syria, because again, as I already mentioned, they are getting their asses handed to them by the well funded and well equipped extremist groups in which they are at **war** with, combined with the fact that they are fighting Assad's SAA and Hezbollah on the second front as well.

The FSA are not terrorists. Do you even know how the conflict in Syria began, or how the FSA formed? The timeline of the conflict is well documented not only with reputable sources but there are tons of videos that could nearly tell you the entire story....

>Moderate rebel groups **have** worked closely with the al Qaida-aligned Nusra Front and the Islamic Front, one of whose factions, Ahrar al Sham, includes al Qaida members among its founders.

The key word here is **have**. They had a shaky alliance in the beginning, because the core of the FSA are moderate and do not wish to overthrow Assad for religious reasons. The FSA is comprised of regular Syrians and defected SAA soldiers. That alliance broke last year when Al Nusra began assassinating senior FSA commanders, and then both Al Nusra and ISIS, whom were still aligned at he time, started killing just regular FSA members. The FSA then declared war against Al Nusra, as well as ISIS.

The paragraph you quoted, and the paragraph *right below it*, which you conveniently left out of this article:

http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/11/us-syria-crisis-usa-idUSBRE9BA08820131211

>ISTANBUL Wed Dec 11, 2013 (Reuters) - The United States and Britain suspended non-lethal aid to northern Syria after Islamist fighters seized Western-backed rebel weapons warehouses, highlighting fears that supplies could end up in the wrong hands.

And the paragraph you purposefully left out, which is right below the one you quoted from the article:

>*The rebel Free Syrian Army fighting President Bashar al-Assad said the U.S. and British moves were rushed and mistaken. ""We hope our friends will rethink and wait for a few days when things will be clearer,"" FSA spokesman Louay Meqdad said.*

I normally don't kick a person when he's down, but since this is information you should learn to prevent you from spewing intellectually dishonest bullshit, I'm doing a good thing here (hopefully).

And just in case you're wondering what happened in the wake of outgunned and under-trained FSA being at war with the very powerful extremist factions, as well as the very powerful SAA and Hezbollah forces fighting for Assad, some FSA members have given up fighting and fled, as they simply cannot face both the extremist groups *and* Assad's forces at the same time and expect to win. 

Some fringe FSA brigades that had a better relationship with the Islamists than the moderate core FSA (the FSA is quite disorganized due to being spread thin) even disbanded and left the FSA, and joined the extremists:

"I think /u/cactusetr420 has a point. I mean, US and Europe can meddle and bargaign better in unstable countries that are easier to control and corrupt. But this has a high economical and human price.

It works sometimes, but not always. Iran and Iraq (under Saddam) were getting strong powers in the region, same for Sirya. And let's not even talk about Libya and how Gaddafi (who can be blamed for many things) transformed a country into a very powerful and influent in the Mediterranean sea (economically and politically) and was leading north african countries to form an alliance. Hell, when he came to Rome Berlusconi even kissed his ring:

because Italy was becoming dependent on Libyan resources (and even investments).

But I don't know, looking at the never ending Israeli conflict I just can't believe that trying to force the region under control, cornering those populations (with a religion that gives them excuses to sacrifice themself till the end) under your influence can bring you any good.

If we don't let middle east people to themself and let them fix their problems on their own (in their ways and on their timings) and we don't compromize and actually try to build something positive instead of pumping money into the war machine we will always have to watch at middle east the same way Israel has to watch Palestine.

Now he does have the economic power to pose a very serious threat to the world economy.  
    *Which brings back the point* that the U.S., excuse me, the ""Coalition"" didn't have to have an acutual textbook victory, as long as the threat of Saddam controlling over half of the worlds proven oil reserves, or for that matter, one quarter, was no longer existant.

What should we do?  Take up arms?  You wouldn't, nor would any other sane person in our situation.  Not only is the military more powerful than the rest of the worlds' combined (not that it wouldn't be marginalized given a civil war), but mainly we're complacent as fuck because even if you're poor in this country, you're still living more comfortable than most of the world.  Why would anyone jeopardize that?  Why would anyone put their lives, or the lives of their families and loved ones, in jeopardy because things could be a little better here, and because our government is a dick to others?  Would citizens of other countries take up arms against their government to stop their meddling in others?

You can argue about what happened in the past - it's the national sport in the middle east. But the events that most directly have led to the current situation - given the relatively stable shape iraq was in post-surge are:
1) The Syrian civil war. 
2) The ongoing trivlization of Sunni's in Iraq.
3) The transformation of Syrian conflict from a broad based moderate movement into a ISIS led reactionary one.

As far as your assertions go, ""any real plan"" is loaded. Was Bremmer a idiot for disolving the Army? Yep. On the other hand, there were plans, and they were well-funded. In fact, Bush pivoted from those plans (remember Stay the Course?) to the Surge, and that plan even worked. It left behind a working arrangement where Shia Sunni and Kurd all basically wiped out the Jihadis.

The onerous is on the consumer now, to dig deeper, few cable news channels would have their ratings go up if they spent an hour mapping the tribal structures of a an Iraqi province or the frequently shifting alliances between a spectrum of barely pronounceable Syrian opposition groups.

Doesn't mean he wasn't taking advantage of using islam as a tool to stay in power.
"if he was an effective leader, he wouldn't have lost his country."
What difference does that make?
"First of all, you need to read the BBC article again. The 80% of western fighters who joined ISIS does not refer to fighters on the western front but fighters from the West (e.g. Europe, North America). The next paragraph after your quote reads as follows:  ""ISIS claims to have fighters from the UK, France, Germany and other European countries, as well as the US, the Arab world and the Caucasus.""   Who knew? Also from the same BBC article: ""In January 2014, rebels from both Western-backed and Islamist groups launched an offensive against ISIS, seeking to drive its predominantly foreign fighters out of Syria.""

Second of all, my position has nothing to do with liking Obama or wanting foreign intervention.  You are forgetting that long before foreign jihadis showed up on the scene, Syrian civilians staged demonstrations against the Assad family which has been in power in Syria for 30+ years.  Ignoring the fact that there are a sizable number of Syrians against Assad, who aren't religious fanatics or blood thirsty terrorists, is an insult to Syrians who have been suffering under bombardments of barrel bombs, starved and imprisoned because they live in areas that were strongholds of resistance against Assad's dictatorship.  Take a look at the pictures of Homs.  The whole city is dust.  Over a million people have been displaced to refugee camps. It's foolishness to believe that all this was the result of fighting a few thousand radical jihadis.  It may not be the right thing to arm moderate groups in Syria, but it's disingenuous to state that the U.S. is arming ISIS when that's not the case.  

And BTW, I wrote a letter to my congressmen opposing military intervention in Syria. That doesn't mean I wouldn't like the international community to do something to stop the carnage if it could.  I find it morally questionable that so many people seem to turn a blind eye to atrocities committed by foreign leaders against their own people (or as Assad calls them ""terrorists"") as long as those leaders are in opposition to the U.S. It's fine to be against American foreign policy, but it's myopic to to be so anti-American you excuse every other bad actor on the world stage.  Call out the U.S. when they do something wrong, but don't distort facts to serve your narrative."

What are you implying?
They don't need Kurdish oil. KSA has the second largest crude reserves in the world. 
Your statement makes no sense on multiple levels. 
"You are correct that the Saudis would probably like oil and control. You're just wrong about who they'd be targeting. They want to crush the Shiites and get control of their oil. 

First, because the Shia areas are where the majority of the oil is. Only ~20% or so is up in the North/Kurdish areas. (That's still a LOT of oil, but not as much as the South).

The second is because control of the oil is really about regional power, the Saudis aren't hurting for money. Kurds are not a concern for Saudi Arabia. Even if they got their own country, they are a minority in the region and generally want to stay apart.

Saudi Arabia's concerns are a strong, Shia-controlled Iraq. That's the big split and broader power struggle. Iran and Iraq are majority Shia and Lebanon has a sizable Shia population. The Gulf States are all majority Sunni.

That said, all this conjecture has one major issue, which is that ISIL is openly hostile to the Saudi government as well."

We built a military for them comprised of moderate Sunnis and Shiites that needed to work together and in some cases they did very well.  We underestimated the power struggle it would be between sunnis and shiites in the region.

Iraq was found to be used as the safe haven and training ground for the terrorists who attacked us. We also needed a foothold in the region to go after the threats. Pretty straight forward to me if you look at the facts minus the politics.
"Somehow I don't think establishing a Sunni Caliphate that encompasses Iraq, Syria, ALL of Israel, and ALL of Palestine fits into that narrative. It's ridiculous to pinpoint objectives of a group and find ways to blame it on outside forces. Nor does it make anything they do legitimate even if that was true. You can find ways to justify anything in life, doesn't mean its right. I find it hard to believe that a group as radical as ISIS is deeply concerned with humanitarian concerns based on their past behavior. "

Not sure why you're being downvoted.  ISIS may want the Iraqi government to turn to the Mahdi army.  That in turn could bring the country to an all out civil war or a similar situation that happened in 2006 and 2007.  
Do you think the Kurds have any interest in territory beyond Kirkuk?

These are not random killings.  During many of the scenes in which an individual is shown, a brief statement about that individual is made showing how he collaborated with either the US or the ""Shia government.""  If you look at some of the executions, you will see that they pull out a green flag.  This is a Shia symbol, and the militants are using both that and various photographs as ""proof"" of the victim's guilt.

These scenes are then interspersed with videos showing ""recruitment and liberation"" of Sunnis.

You will also notice that the militants sometimes dress in uniforms.  These are Iraqi Army uniforms.  They do this to gain entrance to homes without a fight, or even to set up fake checkpoints.  (They do both in the video.)  You will notice in those checkpoints that they are identifying specific individuals and letting others go.

Short story: these aren't just random killings.  They are targeting specific individuals, and attacking military and police units in the open."
This kind of violence is so scary because its so confusing...  Why are they doing this?  is it just random violence to keep people scared? fun? whats the point of it?

There is no taming the Middle East. It's a plague that cannot be cured and will always be at war with extremists. Britain has tried before, they failed as well.

"Dude Pakistan (and to a large extent Saudi Arabia) created the Taliban. The U.S. didn't care about who got what, they just wanted the Soviets to suffer.

Although the Afghan mujahedeen were very religious, they weren't straight up extremists like Bin-Laden, Mullah Omar, Hekmatyar etc. Most of the Mujahedeen formed the Northern Alliance to fight the Taliban after the Soviet Withdrawal."
"> That must be why mujahideen were secretly trained in Scotland by the SAS

1.Are you lying or misreading? There is not mention of Scotland in the article on Operation cyclone. But I digress: All Operation Cyclone's wiki page says is what I said: that the CIA funded the Mujahideen that were ALREADY operating in Afghanistan, providing them primarily with weapons.

As I mentioned in my above comment, the crux of the argument that ""The CIA created modern radical islam"" is that A. the larger body of mujahideen fighters in afghanistan were ALL radical islamic fighters and B. that there is a direct lineage between the mujahideen and the modern day wahabist cells that operate in places like Syria, turkey, afghanistan, iraq, etc. Both of those claims are patently false.

>The CIA used the ISI and the GIP as proxies because, indeed, back then a worldwide proxy war against communism legimated alliances with jihadist groups. 

Again, you confused jihadist groups with the mujahideen. While they were islamic fighters, their actual ties were more to their various ethnic groups and even more so to their individual tribes. Only two groups of the Mujahideen can be tied directly to ""jihadist"" fighting of the recent decade: Al Qaeda, and the Taliban. Neither of these groups were directly funded or trained by the CIA. Al Qaeda themselves deny the connection between the CIA and them. The Taliban appeared in force only later, after most US involvement had ceased and their lineage is more closely tied to Pakistani Madrassas that in Northern frontier areas of Pakistan (madrassas likely funded and idealogically based on wahabist groups from Saudi Arabia

Al Qaeda is a Saudi Arabian organization funded by extremists in that country. The US never gave them money because they never needed to. They had plenty of their own money and by and large wanted nothing to do with the US. The Taliban was created explicitly by ISI, without CIA help. The CIA never liked the idea of the Taliban and wanted to install a democratic government after the Soviets left. The ISI wanted a group of radical extremists they thought they could control. Therefore, the CIA neither created nor trained the Taliban or Al Qaeda, therefore you are wrong.

>The United States most certainly created Islamic militants.

 It is well documented that Bhutto expressed concerns about the Mujahideen, but the United States was convinced that funding all ethnic groups across the board in Afghanistan would prevent any single group from becoming too strong. The Pakistani ISI had other plans, and created the Taliban. The Mujahideen as a whole were not a Frankenstein, the Taliban was. If you want to blame the creation of the modern islamic wahabist movement, blame guys like UBL who used his money to create the groups and brought fighters to Afghanistan for Jihad (even though they had no realy claims to be there...hmm sound familiar?) or blame the ISI who used Pakistani money to fund and train the Taliban so that Afghanistan would be largely under Pakistani influence. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf now admits to supporting the Taliban until 9/11...so who are you really going to blame?

"The point isn't the numbers but the fact that the defenders has a superiority in numbers and parity or superiority in equipment to the attackers.   Normally you expect an attacker to need a three to one ratio to win but the NVA was outnumbered 2.5 to one.  Despite the propaganda the NVA were not supermen.  They lost every major battle they fought against the US.  

They did however fight every one of those battles.   Like the ISIS forces they had tremendous morale and were willing to take on any opponent .  When faced with a disciplined adversary, like the US military, this only lead to massive casualties.  However when faced with a demoralized and poorly lead force it resulted in nearly instantaneous victory.

The key here is not that the Iraqi army is losing battles.  An army can recover from a loss, especially when it is on the defensive and has numerical superiority.  What is troubling is that the Iraqi army is not even fighting.  If you don't have the will to fight, nothing else, not numbers, weapons, logistics, or prepared defensive positions can save you."

My point is that while the US might've smeared the floor with militants' brains when they had all the heavy support and numbers, that doesn't mean they will do it now. When it's just a few officers, instructors and mercs, ISIS presents a pretty notable threat."

In Syria, they made it halal or lawful to kill us even though we are Muslim. In Iraq, they've killed Sunnis, Shiites, women, children, people who have surrendered. In Islam, during a war, regardless of that person's religion when they surrender you cannot kill them! "

Would the Kurds be willing to accept less in order to have their own independent state?
Two wrongs don't make a right do they?
"It's true that many misconceptions exist about what Al Qaeda actually is.

Al Qaeda exists of a core alliance of men who swore an oath to Bin Laden ('Bayat') and various loosely linked jihadist networks who came to Bin Laden with plans and a request for a financial injection to bring those plans to fruition. Hence the oft-repeated phrase ""believed to be linked to Al Qaeda"". Al Qaeda could be described as a venture capitalist firm for ambitious jihadis looking for material support to realize their 'business plans'.

"Fortunately, unlike many in Iraq's military, most of the Peshmerga aren't in it for the money. They're in it to defend their homes and families, from hostile forces on all sides. Money or no, they'll fight with everything they've got if ISIS tries to invade Iraqi Kurdistan, just as they've repelled every attack on Syrian Kurdistan. "

"Their defense is also an excellent power play.  They have taken control of oil rich Kirkuk and will not want to leave regardless of the outcome of this war. They've been trying to get into Kirkuk for the past decade.

Their ultimate goal is still independence and the chaos that ISIS is causing will be to their benefit one way or the other.   Kirkuk is going to be an excellent bargaining chip against Al-Malaki.  Should Iraq fall then they get to keep it anyways and be free of Baghdad as they have always wanted.  "
The Peshmerga are a dedicated force that believes in what they are fighting for and are protecting their home area.  They will fight to the death paid or not.
its easy to talk shit from behind a computer.
"Oh obviously that's true. 

Given that Iraq seems like a standard 3rd world tinpot regim...ummm I mean democratically elected government. Chances are the money is 1) Going directly to bank accounts of politician and 2) To whatever sectarian patronage networks related to people with power over oil revenue and 3) By extension of 2) into funding sectarian militias who they view as more reliable than the army for their personal interests."
"According to HRW and others, government priorities include fucking over the Sunni and backing the Shia."
"The thing is chances are the guys who are defending Mosul don't actually live there. I might be wrong but I seriously doubt whichever Iraqi unit assigned to defend Mosul happens to be composed mostly of soldiers living there.

The problem is that you are looking at this from the PoV of western nationalism where the people in question would be defending coherent states with legitimate governments going back hundreds of years. But the current Iraqi government have existed for all of 10 years or something like that. Why die for a government which may or may not be legitimate and couldn't be bothered to pay you to bleed?"
Yeah pretty much this
"Basically somebody probably stole the money that's suppose to be paying the troops with. When they are buying weapons and stuff directly from the US (somebody probably took a cut out of it anyway) you can't really screw over the US with no consequence. 

Screwing the average Iraqi private though is pretty much consequence free until they desert like now. But I'm not sure if even that's enough to stop government officials/army officers from keep stealing the money."
"Well, I never said that they did.

But it's not that inconceivable because you have to understand how utterly corrupt the Iraqi (or any third world) government is, if they promise to pay you $500/month, there's a pretty good chance your CO takes a cut, everyone on the chain of command takes a cut, and the politician takes a cut so you may or may not get half as much in any given year. And once in a while somebody in the government/army probably stole a big chunk of the budget in which case good luck ever getting the years of backpay owed to you ever."
"Yeah, definitely yes on the mentality part. 

I've posted this a few times already but people ITT are thinking of Iraq like they would a cohesive nation state of the type you see in Europe and East Asia. But in reality Iraq kinda fell apart between 1991 and 2006. It's hard to give your life for a homeland (which was artificially and arbitrarily designated by the British in the first place) and which underwent several wave of sectarian conflict between 1991 and now.

>>I think that the Kurds would be more willing to defend their territory, considering their strong identity, without the possibility of getting territory from Turkey and Syria, they will be much more ready to fight for what they actually have. Maybe the international community should be helping them more.

Yeah definitely, unlike the current Iraq national army the Kurds have being fighting for decades so they aren't just gonna fold.

Same goes for the Shiite militias."
"I read it is not even clear whether ISIS has any pilots at all, much less capable military pilots, and as far as I know modern combat helicopters like those are particularly challenging to operate. They would probably just crash those like a 12 year old attempting to race a stolen Lamborghini.

They could probably buy some support with that $429 million dollars they have.
"I've no idea where the Iraqis have/had them deployed and haven't seen this claim before, but considering the US sold them over 100 reduced-capability export models, they're with some unit or at some armory *somewhere*. I'm sure ISIS wouldn't mind grabbing some if the oppertunity presented itself."
"Not to mention that ex-military were a huge part of the insurgency, and often had the best IEDs and training of the various insurgency components."
"ISIS didn't exist  before the U.S. invaded Iraq.  US military aggression in the Middle East helps militant groups recruit young, jobless males who feel disenfranchised and humiliated.  There are less than 10,000 ISIS militants now.  If the U.S. invades again there will be 10's of thousands in a few months time.  The solution is for governments in the region to stop being corrupt and playing on sectarian divisions to maintain power. It's a long game, but the only solution.  "

"Yeah, they killed 1700 prisoners they took in Mosul, and today they killed 100 reinforcements trying to sneak into Samarra.

Edit: they've also captured the top army guy for Ninewa and I'm pretty sure they killed him this afternoon, but I didn't hear any update."
"ISIS ""seized Western-backed rebel weapons warehouses"".  ISIS seized FSA's weapons werehouse, *regardless* if the US or the UK wanted these arms in the hands of the slightly less palatable liver eating terrorists. (this was close to the beginning of the year)

The paragraph I ""purposefully left out""?  Of course the FSA does not want the vast flow of arms, money, and training to stop.  After arms moved from the moderate terrorists hands into the liver eating terrorists hands (same one's who seized Mosul by the way) the US and UK temporarily stopped the flow.  The ""purposefully left out"" paragraph indicates the FSA wants the flow to continue.  ""We hope our friends will rethink and wait for a couple days"" then continue to send us money, weapons, and training.

You completely ignore the Frontline story from less than a month ago.

> Moreover, **many both inside and out of government fear U.S.-provided weapons could make their way into extremist hands, particularly in a place like Syria, where alliances and foes change with breakneck fluidity**. Moderate rebel groups have worked closely with the al Qaida-aligned Nusra Front and the Islamic Front, one of whose factions, Ahrar al Sham, includes al Qaida members among its founders.

> Perhaps because of those reasons, Congress has never publicly signed off on funding for a training and arming effort, **and officially, the United States only provides non-lethal aid, like food rations, clothing and first aid supplies.**

The point of the entire Frontline, on location with interviews of the terrorists in the field > even though ""officially"" they are given non-lethal aid, in actuality the terrorist themselves say they are given arms and training.

The kicker at the end.
> The United States has **refused to confirm its growing efforts to help the fighters.** Neither the Pentagon nor the CIA would comment on Frontline’s findings.

The FSA is better funded then the entire Assad regime.  The Financial Times reported that Qatar had funded the Syrian rebellion by **""as much as $3 billion""** over the first two years of the civil war.

Given that arms from Syria, and Obama's failed Libya foreign policy have fallen into the hands of the liver eating terrorists, as well as your Koko Haram child kidnapping and child raping variety, sending any aid to the moderate FSA terrorist group is clearly a bad idea."

"Not to come across as rude, but you are wrong. 

Its empirically proven that unstable countries are not easier to control or corrupt, and neither are they better sources of business for American MNCs. Sure, a tactic has been used to de-stabilize a country temporarily to bring a more favourable person/party into power, who then restores order and gives concessions to American firms.

However, neither country is a particularly US-loving state right now, particularly Karzai led Afghanistan. So even ignoring the human cost to US citizens as well as Iraqi/Afghani citizens, from an economical point of view, the wars have not provided any great boost to the American economy, particularly since the majority of the benefits have gone to high tech defence companies that do not generate too many jobs.

And definitely from a tactical military standpoint, the US has not won either war. As the thread sugests, Iraq is already under attack by militants less than 3 years after US troops leaving. Most of Afghanistan is under regional militia control and we will see a strong surge in Taliban attacks the moment most ISAF forces leave by the end of this year.

Sure it's more hindsight a humanitarian decision and one out of self-interest, but the argument can be made.

Nah, the only difference is that Muslims are still fighting repeatedly and are very unstable. Their genetic pool is screwed up. I won't even go into the amount of incest that goes on within that religion. With extremist taking their book to the extreme. Let's not even compare other religions to Islam. Other religions have reached the age of reasoning. 

I don't know why Muslims feels that the world is out to get them. They will never be the only religion and there will always be BILLIONS that will not accept and denounce their religion. Who cares. No one, but Muslims. As the world moves forward that religion simply takes steps backwards. Even U.S Muslims are afraid to go live amongst their own people in the Middle East. "

"No, it was immediately after the deaths of Mohammed, and that is when use the Shia believe that Mohammed has entrusted Islam to Ali in the event of Al Ghader Al Baea, there is no denying that that event has occurred clarifying  the fact that Shia are actually the ones whom were following the right ""path"" whatever you may call it. Yet after the death of the prophet and while Ali was mourning and preparing the burial ritual of Mohammed, behind the scenes him Abu bakir and all the others collaberated to take a part of Islam as they saw Ali to be way too young to handel Islam the way the want it… and it continues on where Ali's wife is murdured by Omar, but Ali is not to take revenge since he is not allowed to kill him, since the prophet has made him promise to not hurt any person. In order to keep the integrity of Islam, consequently by the time of the third khalifa Ali was already in his thirties, living in a mud house away from all the people who lived in a semi luxuries, where he took it as a heaven to live with the poor and feed them ( good characters if you ask me). Soon after, upon the rebilion in egypt against Othman (the third Khalifa), people simply saw Othman as a ruthless dictator whom wouldn't allow anyone outside of the Ummayed family into the ruling of states of Islam (egypt mainly), Ali sent both of his sons to protect and try to resolve the issue but the palace was overrun and then in the process Othman was killed. 


Aisha the prohphet's wife was one of the very supporter to overthrow Othman, matter fact she agreed to rip Othman apart. Muslims then felt astry, like no time else. Many has by then started questioning their faith, people then took up to 50 years old aged man Ali as a khalifa. Ali refused them and told them that after his brother commands to them in the Gahdear event in front of them all before he died, and you disobeyed him (Mohamed and Ali were raised in the same house matter fact Mohammed even said "" I and Ali are from the same tree, rooted in heaven…"" and numerously saying that him and Ali are the same), after a lot of convincing Ali understood fully the situation at hand. As Ali took over the ""Mukhalifien"" (the opposition) made their own armies and started threatening that they want justices for the spilled blood of Othman, awkwardly enough even Aisha said the same. Ali couldn't satisfy all of them and this opposition started cutting routes and beheading people (this is from where the ""Islamic"" killing originates), a war followed whereby Ali won by the sheer power saving Islam yet again from another downfall. 


After Ali was murdered in his prayer, his son Hassan was to be the next to inherit in the line, Muawea Ibn Abi Sufian, went on rampage saying that how can this be possible etc… Hassan gave up Khilafa but in the agreement that his brother is to be khalifa after him. Hassan's startigical thinking saved Islam as whole, as any more wars and people would have completely lost their faiths… 6-7 years later Hassan was posioned (by his own wife who was promised by Ummayed to be some sorta of princess weird huh?). When Hussain was to become the next in line Muawea instated his son Yazid as the next in line, Hussain was angered and avoided them at all costs to evade any war until Yazid sent him a messenger asking him if he will go with him in a bayea (it is just like agreeing that Yazid will be the next leader : voting ), Hussain immediately replied "" the likes of me will never go to agree to let him rule that drunken infidel"",vYazid was infuriated, though Hussian did not say anything that was untrue, this has caused many to question Yazid's power… eventually leading to a war whereby 70 men fought a thousand (ya Hussain was a bit I don't know how you say it but weird), each man with Hussain could've killed hundreds only by the will of his sword (the 70), Abbas the half brother of Hussain by himself pushed a whole army to retaliate by his sheer power till they started shooting arrows that pierced his body, it might seem fictions and I quite honestly think it is, but even opposition do not deny it. 

Anyhow mainly Shia are the one that stuck with Ali and his sons (12 to come) untill the end, the last son of Hussain has mysteriously dissapeared and reappeared several times, many question his existence. Shias claim that he is Mahdi the promised one whom is still alive and will reappear for our salvation, while Sunna disagree and say the promised on is yet to be born. Sunna's are the one that went from a Khalifa to another following their rules and guidance, Shias only admit the sons of Hussian whom are a direct line to the prophet; why, because Mohammed wed his daughter to Ali ( again I repeat they lived in the same house the father of Ali is the uncle of Mohammed whom had taken him into his house after he was orphaned)

They are not going to step outside there unless it's doing something for them or necessary to their security, IMO. I'd expect they'd be willing to in exchange for Iraq recognizing the territory they just took and their oil deal."
"Nah, they just want all their ancestral lands back (which includes Kirkuk - Saddam pushed them off of it and they've wanted it back since, and they've also retaken Tuz Khurmatu which is a smaller city nearby that is also historically Kurdish).

They have rich oil fields, they're sitting pretty up there, or they could be if only people would buy more of it... everyone is afraid of pissing off Baghdad, which claims that Kurdish oil is actually Iraqi oil and therefore not theirs to sell unless the give a big cut to the Iraqi government (see [this](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-13/as-iraq-burns-kurds-try-and-fail-to-sell-more-crude))."

Thousands died to give Iraq a chance, despite most people thinking they would fail.  Their deaths were not in vain, there was always a chance of success.

Well, Dick Cheney and friends had a solution: secure the 2nd largest reserve of light sweet crude, before the Chinese do it.  The problem?  It happened to be Iraq; we burned them a decade ago in the 1st Gulf War, and kept our flying boot on Saddam's neck the whole time.  Now the flying boot was about to be removed by UN (lack of) resolution.  So, after losing the World Trade Center & the pentagon gets hit, do we focus on killing Al-Queda, and our occupation (rehabilitation) of Afghanistan?  Nope.  This is why Fed Reserve Chair Greenspan made his unfortunate observation a few years later about why the US went into Iraq.  

What's just as pathetic, was that Cheney/Rumsfeldt belonged to the dinosaur era of international politics, and thought the US could just permanently occupy Iraq, just like the US won Vietnam.  And the irony of it all, is that even if that 1990's paper was true, we will have staved off the ""peak oil"" crisis anyway, with technological advances in natural gas production (fracking) and alternate energy.  If only the ""Powers That Be"" believed in the papers put out by scientists indicating a future climate crisis in the next 20 years, due to the world's hydrocarbon consumption."
"> America has always needed Saudi oil. Or never did. America never imported much Saudi oil, even in the 1970's. The problem is that Europe and Japan did. And now class, we learn the meaning of the word ""fungible"". 

The issue isn't so much who uses the oil, but how much it costs. 

Oil doesn't have much regional price discrimination. The price of a barrel of oil in Japan costs the same as the price of oil in US. The reason is most oil is shipped via tankers which can go where ever they can fetch the highest price. This is quite different than say natural gas which is shipped via pipelines, and so has a lot more regional price discrimination. The effect is that there is a global price for a barrel of oil, and everyone pays that amount (or something close to it).

*This* is why the US cares about what happens in the middle east. The US is the largest user of oil, and more than any other country is sensitive to changes in the price of oil. The has a huge interest in making sure that the price of oil stays low, or at the very least climbs slowly. A quick rise in the price of oil could see a repeat of the 70s oil crisis. 

This is why the US keeps the Saudi's going. It's not that they keep selling to the US, it that they keep selling. This is also why after the Iraq war China got so many contracts, as long as someone is selling that oil and keeping the price down the US economy can stay afloat. "

ISIS/AQ rose to power in Afghanistan (with Taliban help) and in the Syrian civil war (for ISIS). It had nothing to do with Saddam ruling with an iron fist.

The US did not create the Islamic militants. **ISIS has nothing to do with Pakistani, Saudi, or American intelligence. ISIS is a spin-off from Al-Qaeda,** which is a separate group that has always fought against Saudi & American intelligence. The AQ did have an alliance with the Taliban who were at one time controlled by Pakistan but Pakistan lost that control long ago.

ISIS is more direct in they take up arms and violently overthrow governments and seize territory.  The Caliphate gets established more quickly via violence and brutality.

Al-Qaeda doesn't so much disapprove of violence (I mean, 9/11, folks) as they realize that what ISIS is doing could BRING America into the Middle East which they do not want."

"> I don't! I know something like .5 million died in the war with Iran, and he killed many thousands of Kurds too. But this is over 25 years, and most of them in the early part of his dictatorship.

Its somewhere between .5 and 1 million people in the invasion of Iran. 150k in the genocide of the Kurds. 60k in the annexation of Kuwait. And thousands more tortured and killed by Saddam's police state every year. Additionally, his aggression and his use of chemical weapons caused UN sanctions which caused another million premature deaths in Iraq. 


> The pay off of Saddam is regional stability,

The invasion of Iran is not regional stability. The annexation of Kuwait is not regional stability. Open uprisings by the Kurds is not regional stability. During his reign there was massive civil wars in Yemen and Afghanistan and continued violence in Israel-Palestine, and massive revolts and massacres in Syria. What stability are you talking about exactly? 


> and a natural balance of power vs Shia Iran, who now have much more influence internationally, especially in Syria and, probably soon, Iraq, to defend Iraqi Shias and Samara.

From everything I can tell, expanding Iranian influence has been a generally good thing for the region, particularly in their support for stability and democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq and their fight against Al Qaeda in Syria. They are a much better power for the region than Saddam ever was. Iran is now being balanced again by Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, and Pakistan, but the removal of Saddam has been nothing but good for the region, even if it enhanced Iranian power somewhat. 

> edit: Also, Saddam hated religious extremists (And many speculate was secular himself, and certainly ran a pretty secular/religion blind dictatorship), and ISIS/L would have no place to hide in Iraq, Sunni or not.

The new Iraq also hates religious extremists. Their laws are similar. The democratic government has even more liberal laws towards gays that Saddam had, although the civil society is as hostile as ever towards them. Iraq is very much trying to wipe out ISIL. Its hard with a civil war raging next door which is drawing fighters and resources from across the region. Remember that when Saddam tried to put down the Kurds he had to kill 150,000 people to do it. Lets not pretend that Saddam was some peaceful oppressor. He was not. He had uprisings against him all the time which he massacred hundreds of thousands of people in order to put down. "

>The U.S. Air Campaign over North Vietnam would thus be somewhat of a lost cause, not significantly hurting the communist North enough for Ho and the senior leadership to contemplate ending the insurgency in South Vietnam. Chinese troops in North Vietnam would eventually withdraw, for the most part, by 1970 as the Sino-Vietnamese relationship began to sour over the Paris Peace Talks, and the USSR, among other things. In addition to the AAA umbrella over the North, China would also provide the sinews of modern war that would enable the North Vietnamese Army to undertake modern, large scale offensive operations against South Vietnam in both 1972 and 1975. Chinese trucks, tanks, Surface to air missiles, MIG jet aircraft, 130mm artillery pieces, 130mm mortars, and shoulder fired anti-aircraft missiles, were all moved south. The PAVN had enough first class material to launch a 20 division mechanized Easter Offensive in 1972 into South Vietnam, more divisions than ever commanded by General Patton in Europe during World War II, as one American Officer would point out. [56] The North Vietnamese would pay a terrible price for this gamble, thanks to U.S. airpower and advisors on the ground, losing an estimated 450 tanks and over 100,000 troops killed in action during the 1972 offensive. [57] **China would, again, make up for much of the PAVN equipment lost, after the Paris Peace Treaty was signed, in 1973 and 1974, enabling the North Vietnamese to reconstitute units for another offensive in 1975.** U.S. forces would not be present this time to help its South Vietnamese allies as 18 well trained and equipped PAVN divisions rolled to Saigon in April of 1975, effectively ending the Second Vietnam War. [58] Both Vietnam Wars, from 1946-1975, ended in victory for North Vietnam against the west, but without the massive amounts of military aid provided by the PRC, most likely the outcome would have been different.

Stop being an idiot.

"We didn't go into Iraq because we wanted to spread democracy. As Jon Stewart said, that vile Colin Powell showed the UN wasn't freedom juice he was looking to spread around. We went into Iraq for the stated goal of defeating Saddam because he had weapons of mass destruction, and for the unstated goal of liberating his oil reserves, which were not being utilized to their full capacity and which were under the control of a state-owned company that was being destroyed by the sanctions just like the rest of the country.

In the public pre-game it was all about the link between Saddam and AL-Queda, and the private pre-game all about how great it would be for the world market to liberate that oil. "
"You get a gold star.

But there are factors in the petroleum industry which ends up affecting the pricing of oil in regions.  Part of what makes Middle East oil valuable is that it doesn't have a lot of sulphur contaminants.  That's why they call it ""light, sweet"" crude.  And that's why Alaskan oil and Albertan tar sand oil is less ""valuable"", because it costs more to convert into usable petroleum products.  

Also, transportation costs are a factor.  Yes, a tanker can circumnavigate the globe, but no one buys its oil, if it has to charge too much for transit costs.  That is what makes the Keystone pipeline such an energy irrelevant project.  The US already gets Alberta tar sand oil; it doesn't end up in a major export port.  It ends up in refineries in the midwest, and it makes petroleum fuels cheap in the midwest.  The Keystone pipeline is about moving that tar sand oil to refineries in Louisiana and Texas, where it becomes easy to ship overseas.  Its about increasing profits by cutting transport costs and increasing competitive bidding from newly accessible markets.

Nevertheless, I do believe Iraq was invaded to be able to control who would be able to access the oil (the West or the Chinese).  Oil prices may be fungible, but in a future political crisis, it may be handy to deny access to oil based on political blocs.  Oil prices control who rules."
". (On mobile, saving comment)
Great great explanation!"
"American interest in Middle East oil is largely about control. This was made very clear in the 1940s, as the United States moved into the Middle East. The point has never been access for the United States, but control over our rivals via oil."
America is somewhat sensitive to the changes in the price of oil but I would hardly say it borders on very sensitive. They have mechanisms in place to basically even the American Market during price surges. It's much too big of a country to be overly sensitive to oil and the production/reserves helps that out.

"> The biggest mistake of the US Bush administration was to disband the Iraqi army and those jobless commanders who lost their pension may have joined ISIS or other insurgents in the area.

I'm not sure about that. According to [this](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/06/14-iraq-military-situation-pollack#.U53JQJVVct5.reddit) excellent article, U.S. military advisors gutted the Iraqi military because it was largely non-secular and incompetent.

""*American military trainers and advisors were able to marginally improve the military effectiveness of the ISF by introducing rigorous, Western-style training programs and partnering closely with Iraqi forces in ways that allowed U.S. personnel to get to know their Iraqi counterparts. As a result of this familiarity, over the course of many months, the Americans figured out who were the good Iraqi soldiers and who were the bad, who was connected to the terrorists or militias, who was connected to organized crime, who was smart and brave, and who was lazy or cowardly. And the U.S. military then went about systematically promoting the best Iraqis, and pushing out the bad ones.*

*The greatest impact of these American efforts with the ISF in 2006-2009 were to depoliticize it, both to modestly increase its combat effectiveness and to make it professional, apolitical and therefore accepted as a stabilizing force by all Iraqis. Again, this was largely performed by promoting professional, patriotic Iraqi officers and removing the sectarian chauvinists. The U.S. also pressed Baghdad to accept more and more Sunni and Kurdish officers and enlisted personnel into the ranks. As a result, the ISF became a far more integrated force than it had been, led by a far more apolitical and nationalistic officer corps than it had been before. Indeed, in 2008, when Prime Minister Maliki sent heavily Sunni brigades from Anbar down to Basra to fight the Shia militia, Jaysh al-Mahdi, the Shia of Basra welcomed the ISF brigades and fought against the Shia militiamen.*""

He continues to say that Maliki destroyed the U.S. military's progress by removing the Sunni and Kurdish officers in an effort to secure power, unwittingly replacing them with the same incompetent Shiite officers the U.S. had worked so hard to remove. This also had the critical secondary effect of removing the ISF's secularity, turning it from a modern, secular fighting force into a Shiite militia.

">SIS also arranged for Mujahideen fighters to be trained in heavy weapons on islands off Western Scotland

That is interesting but the website doesn't provide a source. I'm not saying it's impossible, I've just yet to find a verifiable source that it occurred. As I mentioned before, however, the point is completely irrelevant. The vast majority of the mujahideen were not interested in the Wahabist movement and in fact there was quite bad blood between Al Qaeda and other groups within the Mujahideen.

>I don't confuse them, I know the difference, and I find that difference to be marginal in the moral and definitional sense.

Your oppinion really doesn't matter. Most experts agree that Al Qaeda was disliked by most of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan. They were viewed as war tourists who had no reason to be in Afghanistan. The average muja was not a wahabist.

>Why are you utterly full of it? There are jihadist in every sense of the word. It's in their freaking name.

The term Mujahideen is inappropriate in the context of Afghanistan, but it's simply the word that was used to describe the anti-Soviet fighters. The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of the Mujahideen who fought against the soviets were not Wahabist or Jihadists. They were local born fighters repelling an invading enemy. If they picked up and Jihadist rhetoric along the way it was likely from northern Pakistani Pashtuns under heavy influence from Saudi Wahabist clerics operating free ""schools"" out of Pakistan. It is likely the average Muja simply went along with this rhetoric, the vast majority did not become Taliban or Wahabists.

>because they were funded and trained INDIRECTLY by the CIA.

The ISI was training local Afghani fighters to repel the Soviet invasion force. Do you honestly think that all 140,000 or so soldiers trained by the ISI became hardcore wahabist fighters? No. The vast majority were regular people who went back to their regular lives after the war.

>I prefer to listen to the prime minister of Pakistan, now dead because of jihadist infiltration in the Pakistani government and especially the ISI.

The ISI is a border-line Jihadist organization. It created the Taliban. They weren't infiltrated, they invited the Jihadists in.

>Before that? I blame Zbigniew Brzezinski and Jimmy Carter, Charlie Wilson and Ronald Reagan. And men like Gust Avrakotos.

Wahabism was not born out of thin air when the CIA decided to sent money and weapons to locally born fighters in Afghanistan. Sorry, that story is not substantiated by ANY historian or expert. You can dance around it all you want, but ultimately you have NO connections between Al Qaeda/Taliban and the CIA."

Under Saddam we wouldn't have the full-on civil war we are about to experience (unless the international community stops ISIL).  Kurds, Shia, and Sunni are going to butcher each other.  Under Saddam this would flatly not happen. Sunni or not, Saddam was a moderate Sunni.  

Without him we have a power vacuum in Iraq that was filled by the Americans.  Without the Americans, it's a sectarian free for all, with Saudi backed Sunni and Iran backed Shia vying for power and revenge.  Its amazing to think that Al-Qaeda and Hezbollah are no longer fringe elements of extremist Islam, and now we have this international mujahadeen that is well organized, well funded (reportedly took ~$400m from Mosul central bank yesterday), and in control of HUGE swathes of land.

If you actually did the math you would know that you are very wrong. Saddam killed way more than the USA. 

> funny you mention the iran iraq war.....the US played its part in that

We helped him use chemical weapons. It was a terrible thing to do, but it doesn't excuse Saddam. If we are comparing the reign of Saddam to the post-2003 Iraq then this counts against the reign of Saddam. However I do believe that the USA should apologise to Iran and pay it reparations for its support for Saddam in the Iran-Iraq war. 

> the kuwait invasion? you guessed it... the US told saddam they were fine with him invading...

No they didn't. This is the dumbest conspiracy theory ever. Ambassador Gilespie told Saddam that ""we have no opinion on your Arab-Arab disputes"". At the time Saddam was taking legal action against Kuwait for slant drilling. She had no idea that he wanted to annex Kuwait. She was not giving him a licence to annex Kuwait, obviously. What would the motivation for that even be? This is just plain ridiculous. 

"
The sanctions were there because SADDAM used chemical weapons. All he had to do was give them up and let the UN make sure he got rid of them. That's all. Instead he let a million of his own people starve to keep his genocide weapons. 
"I'm still waiting for the source of your claim.

Even though Iraq is turning out badly, the people in Mosul **definitely** do not want the Americans back. How is that for an endorsement of our previous efforts?

Saddam was a vicious ruler, but in 2001, 2002 and (a brief bit) of 2003, he was just a typical tyrant, and not engaged in anything particularly nefarious. 

Saying things ""would be better with Saddam"" misses the point, for lots of people, and maybe Iraqis overall, things would have been better without the US-initiated war."

"No, I wouldn't because if it's France or Denmark getting attacked it means a major crisis in Europe itself which NATO has to deal with because the countries which actually calls the shots within NATO itself have their core interests threatened. 

Turkey's strategic value in the cold war was mostly a flanking state on the Soviet border so if the Russians come down south yeah NATO will probably protect it. 

But Turkey has more or less being fighting a low-intensity war within itself/occasionally in Iraq against the Kurds since forever. And some ISIS raids or rocket attacks or w/e will never threaten any core interest of NATO states in the same way that the red army occupying Ankara or Istanbul would have being because this isn't too different from what has being happening over the last few decades."

Oil is a critical strategic resource, that gave us an economic reason.  Finally, there was the idea that the middle-east is a pit of ignorance that breeds extremism which led to 9-11, and is desperately in need of a real democracy to bring some enlightenment.  It is easy in hindsight to tell stories about ""well it was really done because of X"", but in reality when you are pushing for something huge like invasion of another country, you have to marshal as many different arguments as possible.

"I am not Jewish or Israeli. But I think you are being too hard on Israel. 

Israel is a democracy in the region. It has in fact given many hundreds of thousands of Arabs & Palestinians: Israeli citizenship. Even given them representation in their country and rights to them.

The Arab states sometimes reject Palestinians unlike Israel.

The problem is that the religious extremism in the area has made it very toxic for Palestinians to ever want to try to integrate with Israelis. This has in turn caused many decades of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Israel too has done wrong in this area by use of settlers etc.

The care for Israel may not be just religious from your girlfriends parents. It may be because Israel is a western-leaning society, promoting democracy, civil rights, and modernity in the region, while the Arabs in the region do the exact opposite. I don't see why anyone would not support them.

I think during the wars with Arabs, the Israelis could have conquered more of the land and simply annexed them and given them proper representation from the start, educated them, and made them part of the Israeli state. It would have become a melting-pot country. 

Instead they've created walls, separated areas, left other areas for the Palestinians which were horrifically managed by Palestinians. And this has had some consequences. 

Palestinians have unemployment and a huge influx of religious propaganda and outside-players meddling in their affairs (the Arab neighbors). This leads to a lot of hopelessness, bitterness, idle hands, and anti-semitism. A dangerous cocktail fueled by religion and nationalism."

The mujahideen were trained by the SAS, at the request of the CIA. The United States is single-handedly responsible, through yet another one of their foolhardy eastern anti-communist campaigns, for the growth and festering of fundamentalist forces in Afghanistan, forces which diversified, further radicalized and later evolved to attack them.

Welcome to the Middle East. Its been this way for a very long time. It used to be that the Sunni countries of the Middle East came together to sponsor Saddam Hussein's invasion of Shia Iran, killing around 1,000,000 people. The idea that somehow the US opened up a can of worms here is ridiculous. The sectarian strife was ongoing.

Rumsfeld admitted there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but what does it matter? Casus belli was made to the public and it was effective.

"I agree regarding the Sunnis and Kurds having their own state.  Iraq is just not meant to be a multi-secterian or multi-ethnic state. It lasted this long because Saddam kept it together with an iron fist.  The animosity between the two larger  sects goes back centuries.  The kurds as a distinct ethnic group are caught in the middle. As I said in another comment, the Kurds are very progressive and have done well for themselves in years after the first gulf war. Its about time they got to determine their own future with an independent nation of Kurdistan.

Of course, The USSR was a threat to its own people and anything within it's reach. Hundreds of millions will attest to that. But that reach was regional while the US's is global. No competition really.

The real threat of the Soviet system was ideological, from the very beginning. They were never a serious threat.

All of these books say the same thing: Wahabist Islam was created and grew out of Saudi Arabia, and took root in Afghanistan only AFTER us involvement in the Soviet war left when the Taliban (funded by ISI after US withdrawal of funding and support) took over Afghanistan with the help of Al Qaeda.


>You want to impress on people that you represent the historical consensus on the matter. Hence all the semi-authoritative jive talk.

You realize the SAS is not who publishes that website right? lol...do yuo not know how to identify proper sources? You should take a community college class on that or something...

>Yeah, whatever. Take some fucking responsibility for a change. 
When did I deny responsibility for our involvement against the Soviets? I'm just denying that we created modern Wahabist terrorism through our funding of the war against the soviets. If we created Wahabism, we only created it by spreading capitalism and western liberal democracy into countries that are so ass backwards their only choice was to turn to violence and extremism to fight back.

>If all people read was your mendacious 'analysis', they wouldn't be equipped with the facts to hold the right people accountable.

Something tells me you'll always find a way to twist logic so the US is responsible. I take responsibility for our meddling in the middle east, but no one with any academic credentials believes the US created Islamic extremism.


>Yeah, direct links to Bin Laden were sparse to non-existent.

Direct links from the CIA to bin laden are not sparse to non-existant, they are literally non-existant. The same can be said of Al Qaeda and the CIA. The same can be said of the Taliban and the CIA. You can hide behind tinfoil hat theories about how the CIA funded the ISI and said ""hey create the taliban in a few years after we leave so that they can plot to destroyt he twin towers with AQ and then we can pass the patriot act!""

Lol that's your whole argument in a nutshell."
Not entirely correct. . . The American people spoke for years to politicians and they finally listened. Nearly 95% of Americans didn't believe in the Iraq war and our economy suffered. We only wanted the boys and girls to come back home. 
"Saddam was the president of Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, he started the whole war himself. How can you say it's not his fault? And so what his kill rate was less in the 3 years before the invasion, it is hard to find people to kill when he already preformed a half successful genocide. And He personally ordered the Anfal campaign. Seriously look things up before you spew this BS

> He was just a tyrant who didn't follow the ACLU guidelines for the death penalty, and had murderers and rapists executed without high quality trials.

What the fuck are you on? The 5,000 Kurds were all murderers and rapists? Even the children and babies"
"Well maybe they should have thought of it, but they didn't. They did not know that Saddam was going to take ""we have no opinion on your Arab-Arab disputes"" to mean ""go ahead and annex another sovereign member of the UN""."
I don't see why one is inherently worse than the other. 
"So what if the west gave them to him (Which was actually Europe, the US only gave him conventional weapons), Saddam is the one who used them for genocide. Had even if he didn't have any more chemical weapon all he had to do was let the UN verify that. 

Saddam could have gotten rid of the sanctions easily but he just didn't care if his opponents starved. "
"I guess you couldn't afford college and never wrote a paper. If you make claim group X killed more than group Y, you are expected to provide reputable source(research, report, etc.)  for it, otherwise your paper gets thrown out of window.

"What about Vietnam? 

Also I thought the first Iraq war also went horribly...hardly any of the equipment worked as it was useless in desert environments. Maybe I'm wrong but that's what I've heard."
"Way to miss the point. The point is that hubris is the enemy of any military, our dependence on our technological powers is just waiting for one well placed EMP attack. Or a well executed hack."
"Straightforward military offensive how, exactly? With Iraqi army disintegrating and on the run, I doubt there's anyone there to make it a set piece battle. They can roll into Baghdad from any number of directions, and make it a confusing urban battle in a heartbeat.

I guess the government could set up a perimeter and prepare to defend Baghdad, but unless the ISIS delays, they might not be able to prevent infiltration. Ironically, now the hopes rest on Iran being able to stop it."
I am just saying the claims that US troops will destroy the ISIL are unfounded and overconfident. The real reason for us superiority on the ground has always been lots of heavy support. Right now they don't really have any. 8 hours is a long time - and heavy bombers operating at extreme range are hardly the same as A-10s and Apaches in constant readiness to support any unit on the ground.
"I realize that. However, they're not untrained, unwashed guerillas, many of these guys have experience from fighting in Syria, and it's likely they're loaded with missiles, mortars and heavy machine guns that make attacking infantry hardpoints a viable option.

EDIT: To the issue of concentration leaving them vulnerable to air attack, well, there's limited support available. Also, these ones, they're likely to end up in the city through infiltration and prevail through chaotic, confused street fighting against opponents prepared for a different kind of fight - tactics they've used against both the regime and the FSA in Syria, and apparently now in Mosul too."

"That is correct, but cultural development has been shown to correlate with economic development.

Like, a culture will typically be more progressive if it is set in high economic standards of living. People *tend* to gradually become more open-minded if, on a wide scale, their society can enjoy economic success.

The undevelopment of various cultures can be observed almost invariably in countries where living standards are poor. Conversely, nations with the highest living standards are the most progressive.

Look at how Western culture developed over time. Historically, it was utterly barbaric, yet over the past 100 years it has drastically improved due to living standards.

>From what I see is a country disturbed with war, violence and poverty surrounded by a bunch of neighbors that hate them. And only ability to stay alive is relying on America's interference.

Yes it is disturbed by war, have you ever been to the Middle East? Jews are universally hated there. Go in a taxi and ask them what they think of Jews...  It's a mix of propaganda, nationalism, religious bullshit, and conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the world and destroying everything. It's irrational and you need to stop giving the Arabs the benefit of the doubt. 

Israel also does not rely on America. Most modern nations trade with Israel. Including Turkey, a predominantly Islamic country. You know why? Because Turkey has a history of secularism and lack of religiousness, that is why they aren't so hateful of Jews and why they were allies for so long. The Turks, know what it's like to deal with the shitty Palestinians and Arabs. That is why they had a soft spot for Israel. 

Of course until 2002 when Islamist party took over Turkish politics.

Also this issue is not a ""biggest problem of your generation"" it is greatly exaggerated thanks to Palestinian apologists, and anti-Israel propagandists. I mean really, even if I say something semi-positive about Israel, I will get attacked by tons of people on reddit who are brainwashed to hate Israel.

"The US does not have secret prisons. It has safe houses where they use to transfer prisoners. There is no such thing as a secret US prison. Go find one and come back and show me.

Saddam was a terrible man. What kind of sick human being do you have to be to want him in power.

Our entire foreign policy has been very productive with minor setbacks and most of the time the lesson is: We didn't do enough. We did too little to make a dent in the Middle Eastern problems.

Lies on WMDs were more about the lies of AQ-connection and yellowcake. But otherwise, the information was just flat out wrong, but not because they made it up but because they were wrong.

You have nothing positive to say about the US because you constantly listen to Anti-American propaganda on reddit and blogs. That's not a surprise, once you decide to actually study Middle Eastern history and politics as I have, then you will start understanding that what the US did has been mostly positive.

But you cannot know that by listening to Middle Eastern politicians. You can only know that by understanding what the effects of US foreign policy is from an objective perspective. 

The US has made mistakes such as disbanding the Iraqi army in 2003. Such as neglecting Afghanistan after their war with USSR (which led to the Taliban and Pakistan messing with the country and making it a home of AQ). Such as not nuking the Chinese in North Korean border area. A botched attempt to save Iranian hostages. The Iran-contra affairs. South-American policies that backfired. These were objective mistakes. They cost many lives as a result, but only indirectly and not directly (except for the botched rescue).

But you can't put everything the US does as evil and bad and wrong and stupid. That's just irrational."
"Well what happens is due to anonymity of the internet, the comfort of your own house, and the fact that the topics are always somewhat controversial... The most extreme comments get upvoted the most. The most rabid rants get upvoted and memorized and repeated. 

Thus, the redditors then start to have a bias to hate the media as well because it's not as extreme/rabid/harsh as the reddit comments they see daily.

It's a very funny vicious cycle."

> the US also trained their militants in the early days and worked closely with Bin Laden during the time when camps were set up to fight the 'soviet agression'.

No, they didn't. Bin Laden and his cohort during the Soviet invasion in the 70's were not a threat in any sense and did not in any way contribute to the ousting of the Soviet army. In fact, the mujahadeen found them to be a nuisance. Bin Laden and company were a gaggle of incompetent, poorly trained Arabs that hung out in the mountains. They were on no one's radar because they were laughably insignificant. 

And the other fallacious argument is that the CIA trained the mujahadeen. No, they didn't. Pakistan did. However, the U.S.'s big mistake was partnering with Saudi Arabia, who was exporting radical Islamic ideologies that would poison the entire Middle East and Southeast Asia for years to come, and funding and funneling weapons through Pakistan who was left in charge of overseeing operations and weapons distribution in the region. "

Uh-huh. Actually you're a clown who pontificates with books instead of reading and citing source material directly, who lies about training by US-British CIA-SAS forces of what would later become terrorists, questions mainstream sources out of sheer desperation when confronted, and who is now starting to panic knowing that his little whitewash of covert alliances with terrorists in Afghanistan.... is falling apart. In your defense, you keep getting up after getting smacked down. I admire that in a clown.

> Britain also directly trained Afghan forces, much of which was contracted out to 'private' security firms, a policy cleared in Whitehall; the main company was KNS - 'Keenie-Meenie Services', the name given to mercenaries fighting for Britain in the brutal war in Kenya in the 1950s. **KMS training, led by former SAS officers, was provided to small numbers of Afghan commando units at secret MI6 and CIA bases in Saudi Arabia and Oman;** the latter bases were also used as staging or refueling points for supply flights on their way to Pakistan. **In 1987, the Observer reported a secret proposal from KMS to the CIA to send small teams of ex-SAS instructors into Afghanistan to train rebels in 'demolition, sabotage, reconnaissance and para-medicine'.**

> **Ken Connor who served in the SAS for twenty-three years says that he was part of a team of 'ex-SAS' soldiers who trained selected junior commands in the mujahideen in Scotland and northern England in 1983. The Afghans were smuggled into Britain disguised as tourists, and trained in three-week cycles at secret camps. 'They were well-armed and ferocious fighters, but they lacked battlefield organisation,' Connor writes.**

> **Training involved various military activities, including the 'planning of operations, the use of explosives and the fire control of heavy weapons - mortars and artillery', 'how to attack aircraft and how to lay 
anti-aircraft ambushes aligned on the centre of a runway' and mounting 'anti-armour ambushes'. Connor notes that there was 'strong empathy' between the British trainers and the mujahideen but that there was little warmth between the mujahideen and the British government; 'it was strictly a marriage of convenience between two organisations that had nothing else in common.'**

> Various Afghan groups were supported by Britain. **One initially favoured forced was the Mahaz-i-Milli Islam (National Islamic Front of Afghanistan or NIFA).** Unusually, it was *led by a layman rather than a cleric*, Sayyad Pir Gailai, and supported the restoration of the former king, Zahir Shah - a policy in tune with Whitehall's historical preference for monarchs; Whitehall appears at first to have regarded Zahir Shah as a possible future leader once the Soviets had been defeated. The NIFA forces trained by Britain were commanded by Brigadier General Rahmatullah Safi, a former senior officer in the royal Afghan army who, after the king had been deposed, was living in exile in Britain. Safi later claimed to have trained around 8,000 men in NIFA's camps; **by the late 1990s, he was still living in London and had become the European representative of the Taliban, now in control of Afghanistan.**

> **Britain also supported the Islamist groups. One of the MI6 officers in Islamabad coordinating British assistance to the mujahideen was Alastair Crooke who, it was later reported, 'got to know some of the militants who would become leaders of al-Qaida'.** He was described by Milt Bearden, CIA station chief in Pakistan in the mid-1980s, as a 'natural on the frontier' and 'a British agent straight out of the Great Game'.

> **Training was provided to the forces of Hadji Abdul Haq, a military commander with the Younis Khalis faction of the Hezb-e-Islami. As a favour to the CIA**, MI6 ran the operation to supply Blowpipe missiles to Haq in 1986. Haq was one of those figures whom MI6 introduced to the CIA in 1981, which then had very few Aghan contacts; the CIA subsequently began a long relationship with Haq. After the latter had raised a fighting force, the CIA began shipping weapons to him and he became an intermediary between the CIA, MI6 and the Kabul front. **Haq's office in Peshawar, the organising centre of the resistance in Pakistan, was often full of MI6 and CIA operatives who supplied him with maps of new Soviet targets they wanted him to hit.**

> But Afghan resistance operations were not confined to Soviet military targets. **In Hadji Abdul Haq, Britain and the US had backed somebody prepared to use terrorism to achieve his aims. In September 1984, Haq ordered the planting of a bomb at Kabul airport that killed 28 people, many of them students preparing to fly to the Soviet Union. Eighteen months later, in March 1986, he became the first Afghan commander to be welcomed to Britain by Margeret Thatcher, and subsequently held several meetings with US President Reagan. Responding to British criticism of his role in the airport blast, Haq said that the purpose of the bomb was 'to warn people not to send their children to the Soviet Union'. A Downing Street spokesman said at the time that 'the prime minister has a degree of sympathy with the Afghan cause inasmuch as they're trying to rid their country of invaders.'**

> Another of the military commanders in Younis Khalis' faction of the Hezb-e-Islami was Jalaluddin Haqqani, who received a large quantity of US weapons, much of which were used to help equip the Arab volunteers. **A later US Defence Intelligence Agency report noted that Haqqani was 'the tribal leader most exploited by the ISI during the Soviet-Afghan war to facilitate the introduction of Arab extremists.'**

> **Milt Bearden later wrote that Haqqani was 'America's best friend during the anti-Soviet war.'The CIA and the ISI came to rely on him for testing and experimenting with new weapons systems and tactics. Haqqani would go on to become a leading military commander in the Taliban and the 'Haqqani network' is presently one of the major Taliban factions fighting the British in Afghanistan. Another of Khalis's junior commanders in the 1980s was Mohammed Omar, who would go on to lead the Taliban as Mullah Omar.**

(LOL!!)

(... Section about Massoud skipped ...)

> Britain also extended backing to the extremist Hekmatyar, who was invited to Downing Street in 1986 and met Foreign Office officials in London in 1988. **Most US aid went to Hekmatyar - by conservative estimates, at least $600 million. Hekmatyar was also a ruthless killer, famed for skinning infidels alive, while his group was responsible for some of the most horrific atrocities of the war, such as the slaughter of members of other Afghan groups that were seen as rivals. Hekmatyar worked closely with Bin Laden and took a virulently anti-Western line: Saddam Hussein's Iraq and Qadafi's Libya were also funders. A US Congress task force described his group in 1985 as 'the most corrupt' of the Afghan parties.**

He is also a suspect behind the 5 September 2002 assassination attempt on Karzai that killed more than a dozen people.

Well said.
"I know this is way late, and I agree with almost everything you've said in this thread, but waterboarding is most definitely torture and is extremely painful.  Drowning is one of the most painful experiences a human can endure.

Waterboarding is one of the worst forms of torture.  It's not only physically excruciating, but it's psychological effects are immense and can last forever, often causing PTSD.  Breathing is such a primitive bodily function that it cannot be prevented voluntarily, when faced with the possibility of not being able to breath, humans will do anything, that's why it is so effective."

"It depends on what aspect of culture you mean.

I am talking mostly about how much ""social justice"" a culture has, or how ""progressive"" it is - that is, how much it has respect for individual freedoms, gender equality, racial equality etc.

To an extent, gender inequality could hold back an economy. In a traditionalist society where women are denied equal opportunity, that's a *lot* of lost potential of female workers.

However, that may limit *how* successful an economy can be, but it won't stand in the way of overall success. The Western powers developed rapidly throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s despite being misogynistic and traditionalist societies.

Aside from that point, I don't see how an undeveloped culture could ""hold their economy back""."
"Oh dear... Oh my... You realize that the fighting in Syria started mainly after US troops left Iraq? You didn't know that?

SOI did not give the Sunnis a supply of trained fighters. It didn't. They did their job and were their own group after that making their own decisions. It has nothing to do with the US. Trying to tie them together is nonsensical.

Sunni and Shia militias get funding from a variety of sources in the region itself. There is nothing surprising about that and has nothing to do with SOI."
"The whole point of waterboarding is that it is psychological (in your head) and not physically painful. It's very annoying and hurts your throat. It provides great stress.

It does not mean pain.

If they wanted to make it painful (the most painful) they would use Iron Maiden, Electric shocks, and fingernail breaking etc. That's more painful.

Waterboarding is something even our own soldiers go through to train against it. Because it isn't that painful and doesn't have that much damage. 

It certainly can have traumatic effects though, but that is something soldiers must train for.

You need to provide scientific evidence that it is ""the most painful experience"" not just testimony from some journalist or something like that in a mock exercise. Because such a person cannot compare it to fingernail-breaking etc."

My argument was, and is, that the industrial-scale clusterfuck that was Operation Cyclone set in motion a chain of events which caused 9/11 to occur. This is a position shared by various serious critics of US foreign policy, including the goddamned **former prime minister of Pakistan** Benazir Bhutto, various [commentators (editor of the Guardian)](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/20/mythsandthemujahideen), and many others. So, that sorry-ass strawman argument is now dealt with. Permanently.

You were caught lying about direct training of the Mujahideen by the US and the UK. I say lying because you persist in the face of plentiful reliable source material. (Reeve, Curtis, [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-13185306)) You were caught attempting to obfuscate the direct links between the networks funded and trained by the US-UK-ISI-GIP alliance and the terrorist networks we now wage 'war' against.

"It wasn't ""thousands by death squads"", it was hundreds by a (admittedly flawed) legal system.

I am not saying it didn't matter, but the death toll from the Iraq War II was a half million, while if we had let Saddam stay in power, and he had kept up his behavior _of his last few years in power_, the death toll would have been in the low thousands.

"I agree that all the Sunni fighters are essentially the same since their beliefs don't vary much. That much is true, but to the citizens of Iraq they are still losing their homes to people who weren't born there. I wouldn't consider AQI anything major anymore. They were destroyed by the US military presence so bad that a lot of fighter left to join other groups like Al-Nusra, ISIS, and the some other groups. They would still be using the term AQI if there leadership wasn't so scattered and so many people killed or captured. If you were a Sunni militant, would you join the group already being decimated or the newer group kicking everyone's ass in Syria and taking cities in Iraq? "

Disbanding the SOI was an Iraqi decision and it happened over time.

"*Waterboarding is torture. It causes severe physical suffering in the form of reflexive choking, gagging, and the feeling of suffocation. It may cause severe pain in some cases. If uninterrupted, waterboarding will cause death by suffocation. It is also foreseeable that waterboarding, by producing an experience of drowning, will cause severe mental pain and suffering. The technique is a form of mock execution by suffocation with water. The process incapacitates the victim from drawing breath, and causes panic, distress, and terror of imminent death. Many victims of waterboarding suffer prolonged mental harm for years and even decades afterward.*

I'll stop here, because you've closed the door for any objective debate, by telling me what I need to do.

">My argument was never that the United States created Wahhabism; you were arguing with somebody else...

>We will never have a discussion on equal footing because you're painfully dishonest.

Painfully dishonest? You're the one trying to pass off an SAS fan website as a primary source (lol). Then, time and time again you try and connect the CIA to Al Qaeda and the Taliban and you simply cannot do so because the link does not exist. Every single respected historian and regional expert agrees that the ties between CIA funding and training and Al Qaeda or the Taliban are scant if non-existant. **The Taliban was created AFTER the CIA left Afghanistan**. Al Qaeda **had plenty of funding from Saudi sources, and the CIA outright says that the locals disliked AQ and didn't play nice with them because they were seen as war tourists** So you have nothing...you're wrong. No one agrees with you except Pakistani politicians with an agenda and tinfoil hats who hate the United States.

Let me break down the conversation for you, and how you've utterly lost every step of the way:

The original point of contention was: the USA created Islamic Terrorism. 

My response was: No, Wahabist Islam existed well before the USA became involved in Afghanistan and no direct training or money has ever connected members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban to the CIA (even money funneled through the ISI).

So, how you have failed:

1. You fail to connect the average Soviet-era Afghani rebel fighter to the Wahhabist movement(the core of the modern jihad movement). Just because they called themselves Mujahideen does not mean they considered themselves part of the Wahabist movement. Furthermore, Wahabism caused the dissolution of the coalition that fought the soviets as soon as the soviets were defeated. 

2. You fail to prove that CIA money was given directly to any Wahabist sect operating in Afghanistan despite mountains of evidence from numerous sources to the contrary. 

3. You refuse to accept that the ISI is a Wahabist influenced organization that is by and large responsible for the explosive growth of the Taliban and AQ post-US withdrawal of funding.

4. You refuse to acknowledge that the Taliban didn't even exist until after the withdrawal of us funding and training in Afghanistan.

5. You refuse to admit that AQ is a Saudi Funded, Saudi trained operation with ties to radical clerics associated with rich people in Saudi Arabia

6. You refuse to acknowledge that Wahabism was created well before Operation Cyclone and that its primary purveyors (Al Qaeda and associated groups) have always operated independently of regional conflicts. They simply take advantage of regional conflicts to justify their horrible acts of violence and subjugation. 

You're wrong, you lose. GO back to your cave."
"There's a difference though. the CIA dropped pamphlets on Saddam's army, telling them to go home and stay there until the US recalled them after Saddam's government had collapsed. The CIA and DoD were in talks with some of Saddam's top generals before the US invaded, and agreed to allow Saddam's army to stay after the initial invasion, as long as they didn't fight back, and as long as they let them purge out the Saddam loyalists. Paul Bremer went against the White House, the CIA, and the DoD and disbanded Saddam's army his second day there on the grounds of ""this army fled from us. Lets build a newer and better one"". Yeah, they fled from you... they were gonna work with you!

TL;DR: 2 different situations and you can't compare the 2"
"Because when the religious movements tried to overthrow Saddam for being secular he wouldn't have started more genocide. 

Calling me ""sick"" (whatever you think that means) doesn't make your argument any less idiotic "
"Ah boy is mad, still waiting for the source of your claim: US killed more Iraqis than Saddam."
"According to the quote I provided, from the National CounterTerrorism Center, AQI _became_ ISIS.

"My son joined before George W. Bush lost his mind and led us to war over lies. My son joined to defend America not fight, kill and possibly die over lies. He did not volunteer for that. So when you join and suddenly become a hostage to an insane leader it not what you signed up for. "
"answer is simply war,every decade there has been wars in the region,big or small,and west(and russia or ussr) always has a part whichever conflict you could name past 2 century.they couldnt teach anything to their children cept the faces of many enemies.One party gains power and rules over other parties,later other parties gain power and rules and complete the cycle.Afghanistan was stable till west saw them as a danger with russians,look at the fucking view of afghans now,gaving birth to el-kaide meanwhile

"Legal experts are not scientists or experts in torture or pain or neurology.

I'm a legal expert, but I don't go around writing open letters about a topic out of my field of expertise. I just write it on reddit.

>I'll stop here, because you've closed the door for any objective debate

No you've closed it because you have solidified your opinion on the basis of other peoples' opinion rather than any scientific or testable measure.

>, by telling me what I need to do.

When you don't understand how to provide evidence, of course I will tell you how. To teach you because you clearly don't know.

>it's not something that is up for debate, it is painful and the idea that it isn't torture

It is up for debate. Again see: you are the one closing the door for debate. You are unable to emotionally detach your hatred of the Bush administration from the reality of whether waterboarding is truly torture or is thought to be torture by the political hype surrounding it.

If the goal was to cause pain then waterboarding would not be used by the ""evil bush admin"". They would be using fingernail breaking, constant cuts, iron maiden, squeezing with leverage, beatings, electric shocks etc. These are how you provide pain. 

Instead you are trying to argue about something you have not experienced. Something you cannot provide a frame of reference in the ""degree of pain."" Something that even the military trains for, because it is not as painful or permanent.

Hey I hate the Bush administration too, but you're arguing about a different matter."
"Now you are asserting you know how history would have unrolled if we hadn't invaded? You are mentally deranged, delusional, and should seek help."
"""mad"" is one thing i dont get over anything internet....i just have little time for conceited little shits"
"What do they provide as evidence? I don't believe a word my government has to say, they also denied the mass global spying. I only listen to facts and reason. My government has more to gain by saying they are the same enemy than admitting things are more complex than they say.  "
"yeah because Europe and America haven't had any wars in the past few centuries... /s

you obviously don't even have a basic understanding of history. I suggest you get an education before spouting your ignorance next time."
"Waterboarding is torture, plain and simple.  ""Great stress"" is part of the definition of torture.  It is one thing to go through simulated torture as part of survival school, but it is an entirely different thing in practice.  There's no justification for torture by the Land of the Free.  We are above that and you are scum for even thinking this vile filth.  I would postulate with great certainty that you, sir, are no legal expert.  If you are, I pity the people you advise.  "

"after Yugoslavia brokeup into small pieces , a 3 year war between Boshnaks and Serbs took place which became an international conflict very quickly.Please tell me how well-developed those 2 compared to others in that region.Now that war lasted only 3 years but the middle east never had  peace  thanks to many small(including terrorist) groups who kept fighting , and the invasions of big groups.

if you know about the wars(history) in Europe and can not deduce this outcome it is time for you to educate yourself"
I am a legal expert. Great stress is not torture. It's a key component in any interrogation to produce pressure for the person to confess. That is what we do in the land of the free to protect the free from the oppressive.
"i said i had little time not no time

you dont seem to know what ""hypocrite"" means either

I would believe people actually in that region. 
the middle east has been a shit hole since before the Bosnia conflict... you're not even able to follow this conversation.
"Torture is a form of oppression with the ultimate goal of coercion.  If America condones torture, then it is not the ""Land of the Free.""  You don't even know what you're saying.  

While it is true that ""great stress"" is a component of the waterboarding experience, the major component is the drowning and repeated resuscitation, which is an experience that could only be classified as ""great stress"" by a sociopath.  It is painful and it is just as bad as having your fingernails popped off.  "
Still waiting for the source.
i compared them to tell how armed conflicts can influence the development of countries
"Torture is an interrogation method created mainly to induce either fear or coercion. However, it is either or. It can be oppressive if used for the purposes of coercion. But it can also be useful if it is meant to be safe and only applied for the purposes of fear and compel cooperation.

Yes, it is the fear of drowning that is what gets people to be compliant and cooperate with the authorities. Great stress is induced and great fear rather than the pain of injury (which is what a lot of other torture is about).

I mean if it was about coercion/oppression and a form of inducing pain, sadistically, then they would just be breaking nails and causing permanent injury or electric shocks. This is clearly not the goal. They use waterboarding because it simulates drowning, inducing fear without the full permanent damage or injury or harm.

It is not as bad as having your fingernails popped off. 

Your comparison is clearly false. Every single torture could be assigned a number in terms of pain factor. None of them are equal to the other.

The choice of what to use is absolutely relevant to the goal they are after. The US is after information and cooperation. Not after pain or sadism or punishing the enemy. Now compare that to how Russia or China does it."

Ultimately this is all a local issue requiring local players to sort it out.

I've watched western intervention in conflict zones my while life.

Not one has worked out.

I have family members who have been watching the same their whole lives.

They tell me, like Google searches, that it hasn't worked out.

From big ones like Korea and Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, through to smaller forays into African States like Somalia and Latin American countries like Bolivia.

The only reason I can see that people aren't 100% behind withdrawing US troops from places they have no right to be is because Trump ordered the withdrawal.

The alternative was another decade of occupation of foreign territories, with all the fear, hatred and ill will that generates. 

My american friends, how often do you have to do something before you fucking learn?"
"So Putin backs the Syrian's right? Which means his cockholster, sorry i mean Trump, will now too?"
"Syrian troops fighting Turkey on Syrian territory is not civil war. We do have situation of “bad guys” fighting other “bad guys”, but in this particular case, Turkey is the real “bad guy”. Not to mention that the real reason Turkey fight Kurds in Syria is to suppress Kurds in Turkey."
The Syrian Civil War has been a proxy war for 8 years already.
"Devil's advocate: what role do powerful countries play in promoting peace? At what point is one morally required to intervene? 

Non-interventionism was US foreign policy...until WWI. Appeasement had clearly failed after Hitlet annexed the Sudetenland, because it didn't stop him from invading Poland. Non-interventionism failed again, and it wasn't until Pearl Harbor when we realized our mistake.

Countries have allies - what do you do when your ally calls for help?

Saddam invaded Kuwait with the clear intention of annexing the country. Had it not been for the coalition intervening, Kuwait wouldn't exist. 

In my opinion, intervention should be limited in scope, but I don't think isolationism at all costs would make for a peaceful world."
"I totally agree with you that USA foreign policies very seldom result in “promoting pice and democracy” (Kuwait war is the only example I can think of, when the end result was some what positive). However, just pulling all US forces from Middle East is not a solution. 

There is a two part saying, with first part going like this: “all complicated problems have simple solutions”... unfortunately the second part is: “and it is always wrong”. Most of Americans object to US withdrawal from Syria not because it was initiated by Trump, but because it is absolutely the worst possible way to end US involvement in Middle East conflicts. 

Come to think of it... there maybe one somewhat simple solution which would help a lot... if we can agree to stop selling arms to **any** countries involved into active military conflicts (regardless of if we think about these countries as “good guys” or “bad guys”)... that may help."

Big guys use the little guys against one another so that they are no held directly responsible, little guys call out the big guys when they no longer uphold their end of the bargain, which they really do. I think it's a power game between the east and the west, being played out in the middle. I think there's a lot of divide and conquer going on, I also have a feeling all the big guys know exactly what's going on and keep the citizens and little players in the shadows so that they can keep playing their game of life on a macro level while everyone else struggles to make sense of the chaos on a micro. I suppose what I mean is, superpowers have always played the game of shadows, and we get a lot of misinformation constantly as we aren't really observing directly, only secondhand sources, so I think that the big guys as always, are just playing their power games without regard for common humanity."

"I know, that’s my point.

Almost all the direct action the West has taken as blown up in our face."
Is his rationale flawed?
Yeah because fighting for a concept like nation is backwards and obsolete. You and your family are far more important than something like an area of land with borders that often change and never remain in a constant state throughout history.
"So leave your house while that ""nation"" fights for it just so you come back and retake ""your"" house?"
"That ""nation"" is Assad. You know that right?

Half of these people left because of him. And you want them to fight for him?

"Perhaps because or military service my view is that this equates to abandoning one's post. 

I'm not wanting anything of anyone. I'm asking how after fleeing for safety from Assad's ""nation"", does it make sense to complain when said nation assumes ownership of your residence after a failed civil war?"
"The key was a chemical called hexamine, which seems to be unique to Syria's chemical weapons recipe; no one else has been known to use it when making Sarin. The other key is that Sarin is highly unstable, and has to be stored in binary form in special containers until hours before its used, making it highly unlikely that anyone but the Syrian government carried out the attack. It's not something that can be brewed up in a basement, and even if rebels had captured stocks of the binary agents, it takes a specialist to mix them properly and load them into the rocket for delivery.

Independent experts (and even some amateur commentators like the Brown Moses blog) have been writing about the hexamine connection for several years now, but this is the first time the professionals at the UN and OPCW have confirmed that they too believe hexamine may be a ""smoking gun"". I wish I could talk more about how hexamine is used (it may be used as an ""acid scavenger"" in the recipe, but that's been debated) but for obvious reasons the experts aren't really willing to publicly discuss what might be a shortcut for rogue states to more easily manufacture nerve gas."

*The methodology has been described earlier in this report. However, due to the ongoing conflict, it was not possible for the site to be secured and the team was not able to visit the site. The team therefore relied on: interviewees, who were either identified by other entities or accessible in hospitals; samples (lacking full chain of custody by the team) as made available by the interviewees; medical records; and biomedical specimens, both those for which the team had full chain of custody and those taken by others.*  
  
*Although, some witnesses advised that the release was due to a munition dropped from an aircraft, the FFM was unable to retrieve any items from the site which would indicate the means of dispersal of a chemical. After analysing photographs and video supplied by witnesses, the FFM could not establish with a great degree of confidence the means of deployment and dispersal of the chemical.*  
  
*Whilst the conditions for a safe visit to Khan Shaykhun were not met, the FFM concludes that a large number of people, some of whom died, were exposed to sarin, and that the release that caused the exposure was likely initiated from a release in the vicinity of a crater in the road, located close to the silos in the northern part of the town.*"

"My knowledge of organic chemistry is limited to undergrad, but isn't hexamine used pretty commonly? How difficult would it have been for an unknown group to intentionally add hexamine to their sarin gas supply to frame Syria?

[deleted]
"But how do they know for sure that there was hexamine in the weapons used? And only Syrian chemical weapons contain them? I'm not saying I don't believe the state used Sarin, but it sounds strange that only Syria developed this recipe, considering the fact that they aren't a leading nation on weapons development. "
During a civil war parts of the official military usually join the rebels too along with equipment and expertise.
"You gotta remember that the rebels once controlled over half of Syria, including military bases, chemical weapon storages etc. And a recent report revealed that over half the rebel casualties are foreigners, which hints at their composition. It would not be hard for rebels to find or even hire a chemical weapons expert who would be willing to assist their cause. Saudi Arabian money flowed freely to AQ, ISIS and other rebel groups, they can surely muster at least one person who can build a chemical weapon.

You have to look at who benefits to determine who used these weapons. And the only ones who benefited are the rebels. They got to paint Assad in bad light and attract financial and military assistance from the west. Luckily, it wasn't enough to destroy the country.

Also notice that all the chemical attack sites were not strategically valuable for Assad, they were random places with no combatants. One of them occurred just in time for international experts to arrive to investigate chemical weapons. A little bit too convenient I think. You can claim Assad is a harsh ruler, but he certainly isn't insane and doesn't do insane things just for fun. If he used weapons, that would be to achieve a strategic gain, all they did was make life harder for him in reality. It is beyond any doubt that the rebels used chemical weapons in an attempt to discredit the government of Syria. Luckily it seems they ran out of the chemicals by now and will no longer be able to commit such atrocities."
"Why would Syria ever use chemical weapons though? They can much easier and cheaper achieve the same result using conventional explosives and have literally 0 international lash back from using them?  
  
Using chemical weapons will give righteous freedom Casus Belli to US to drum up for war against Syria.  
  
It would be about the dumbest strategic decision imaginable for Syria.  
  
I don't buy it."
"Thanks for the info, and adequate username btw."
"Assad follows the Russian way, deny deny deny"
You would be surprised of the amount of people still trying to find some wierd explanation as to how it's the rebels that gassed themselves.
People think Assad is on their side protecting Western civilization so they give him a pass. If Assad was targeting anybody but his people they would be wanting to off his head
"I believed it was Assad from the start, and supported the tomahawk missiles we used against them. 

But, to be fair, the other side of the argument was convincing in some aspects. Particularly the line of logic that, given the fact Trump was cozying up to Russia and seeing every non-government combatant as a terrorist just as Assad says, the fact that Assad would press his luck with a chemical attack just didn't seem likely. What strategic objective could that achieve the constant barrel bombs couldn't?"
">The fact there are people out there that tried to deny this is hilarious.

What' really gonna bake your noodle is that the majority of posters in the main subreddit about the Syrian civil war (/r/syriancivilwar) do deny it and think it was a false flag to justify an invasion of Syria."

Except that the government claimed that they never lost control of their own chemical stockpile.
"I don't think you understand. This is a delicate chemical compound we're talking about. It's needs extreme care and handling and timing. You can't just sneak in, grab a canister and get in a jeep and drive off, it needs special transportation and special handling. Like an earlier comment said, even if the rebels have stolen some, it takes a specialist to brew it together. And let's not forget how it would be executed if it was carried out by rebels. You'd need to know precisely when and where the bomb would come, so you could get the sarin gas in place. You'd need to brew and fix it properly in time, get the hexamine in it to frame Assad, and also you'd need to kill yourself and your entire family with it. "
"Always trying to excuse Russia/Syria/Trump.... Even with the most damning evidence...

We know where the chemicals came from, we know which plane launched the weapon. But ""WHERES THE PROOFS!""

Meanwhile: ""OMG CIA VICTORIA NULAND XAXAXAXAXAX!"""
No non-state actor is known to have ever flown a helicopter in the Syrian civil war. The Saraqib attack was back in 2013; at that time only Syrian helicopters were known to be flying in Syrian airspace.
What standard is being applied to Assad that wasn't applied to the U.S.?
"Two wrongs doesn't make this a right.

Assad should still pay for this if there is any justice in this world."
"You have your timeline mixed up. The attacks in question occurred in 2013, whereas Syria handed over some of its weapons in 2014 as part of a deal between the USA and Russia to prevent the USA from bombing the stockpiles instead. The chemical analysis was carried out on samples of the chemical weapons surrendered to the UN in 2014.

So a better analogy would be finding a murder victim, making the guy you suspected of shooting that victim turn over any guns they owned, then running ballistics analysis and confirming the bullet you dug out of the victim was fired from the gun the suspect handed over."
"Under Bush Senior, the US established a no-fly zone in Iraq after Saddam gassed his Kurdish populations. It was a little more tricky for the US to establish a no-fly zone in Syria due to Russian intervention, but to say that the world doesn't do anything when chemical weapons are used is not exactly accurate...."
Problem is the stockpiles were looted when that airbase was overrun. So just because Syrian government stockpiles does not equal syrian government use.
"The attack happened when a Syrian regime aircraft bombed a site in Khan Sheikhoun so if this conspiracy theory is correct:

* They would have had to know exactly when a Syrian regime aircraft was going to bomb them
* Have sarin ready (extremely difficult) with the hexamine signature to frame Assad (even more difficult) prepared at the site  and mix them together just as they were bombed
* Kill themselves and their families in the process

If they were actually capable of such a sophisticated forgery they'd be able to inflict far more damage on Assad himself by using it on him or assassinating him. Somehow they can't do that yet they can use extremely sophisticated chemical weapons on themselves. "
"This why conspiracies don’t get exposed.

When a group has the Human Resources pooled towards a certain objective they can then feasibly pull it off despite what it might seem to an individual as impossible.

So when someone says;
The reason why it’s not possible because there was no specialist because apparently no one cared enough to frame the Syrian government so why would there be a specialist?

That’s not really a convincing argument."
"Not really relevant when the government claims that they never lost control of their stockpile before ""turning it in""."
A brutal murderous dictatorisnt going to act rationally  
"Gassing people is what dictators do and it's rational (but criminal) for him to do in a war, as it was rational to nuke Japan in WW2. "
"> Why would Syria ever use chemical weapons though? They can much easier and cheaper achieve the same result using conventional explosives and have literally 0 international lash back from using them?

It's for spreading fear and because they're running out of actual weapons (hence the use of barrel bombs). Nothing spreads fear like chemical weapons.

> Using chemical weapons will give righteous freedom Casus Belli to US to drum up for war against Syria.

Nope. They knew they had Russia to veto any UN security council resolutions and protect them from any US invasion."
"> Using chemical weapons will give righteous freedom Casus Belli to US to drum up for war against Syria. 

The real world isn't a Paradox video game."
"Think about it. Bombing your people to bits, and you expect them all to be faithful to you afterwards? No, Assad feels that he needs to be in control this time, and that under his watch, there won't ever be another group against him again. But the question is, what's the best population control you could ever use? It's fear. Every country uses it, be it Europe going on about refugees, US going on about guns and Muslims. These things get people in line. Assad thinks the same way, but carries it out differently. Sacrifice the few, to benefit the many. You need to make ""examples"" for people to understand what NOT to do. The Syrian people know exactly who sent the chemical bomb, but the rest of the world is conflicted. They think of every logical and rational reason why Assad wouldn't do this (Basing their opinions on what they see in the media), but this isn't about reasoning and opinions. This is about FACTS. And here is the ""conspiracy theory"" finally proven."
"> I don't buy it.

It doesn't matter how stupid it is. It was done, and because of people like you it will likely continue since there will be no punishment against something (that against all evidence) is ""impossible."""
"Well, two things, first, people are dumb, and 2nd,  Obama said chemical weapons were his red line, and then it turned out he was just talking. So, the Syrians might have decided we wouldn't do anything. And I think its fairly safe to say we're not getting involved deeply in Syria, as in, we're not deposing Assad. we're not in the mood. And the syrians probably know that."

">the fact that Assad would press his luck with a chemical attack just didn't seem likely.

It's almost as if Assad is prone to constantly overreacting to events?

Much in the same way that he responded to relatively non-violent protests (largely about economics and opportunity for Sunnis in Syria) with machine guns and death squads, Assad saw Trump's reluctant acceptance of his existence as a blank check.
"
"Pretty much all the chemical attacks have happened while Government forces had an upper hand. The attacks were also more or less ineffective and the only thing they accomplished was to gain support for the rebels.

The attacks in Iran were extremely effective, the ones in Syria were hardly more effective than an airstrike or an artillery barrage. The scope is completely different. 

If you look at who helped Iraq develop its chemical weapons and who is in the coalition backing the Syrian rebels it's easy to see why people are skeptical. Especially because the US government and intelligence agencies backed Iraqi claims that Iran was behind the chemical weapon attacks. "

I guess I took issue at them saying they were the only POSSIBLE culprit.
I don't know if it is a reasonable doubt, but since Saraqib is only 50km (about 15 mins flight) away from the Turkish border and the whole region was controlled by rebel groups it seemed possible to me that a helicopter could have come from there. Was there anything stopping such a short flight? 
If there was, would that not be able to identify the helicopter responsible? where it flew from? etc..

"I think the concept was that a bombing on a rebel group released the the chemical weapons they had stockpiled. Ultimately, Trump decided it was Assad and struck back at Syria for what the international community sees as a dick move.

Rebels captured at least some Sarin from the Assad regime.  They are known to have used it on multiple occasions.  The most plausible theory I've heard is that a Syrian jet struck a rebel weapons cache in Khan Shaykhun that contained some of the Sarin that they had captured.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_chemical_weapons_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War

Depends on what you mean by useless. Are you of the belief half the missiles missed or fell out of the sky before reaching the targets or are you saying the goal of launching the missiles was not achieved?
Has Assad carried out another sarin attack since?

Anyone sensible would know the context of what I meant.
"Except the stolen chemicals theory doesn't work either since the chemicals were released when a Syrian aircraft bombed the site. The only plausible theory for it not being Assad is if somehow a third party stole a Syrian military aircraft, loaded it with sarin from the regime's own stockpile and then bombed a rebel site and then flew back without anyone being caught/arrested. This makes no sense."
"Main argument against that would be that rebel areas are replete with aircraft spotters who would have seen it. Also, the Syrian radar network would've detected such an intrusion and no such intrusion was claimed.

But the deeper problem with that entire line of argument is that it presumes that Turkey, a democracy which doesn't even use cluster weapons due to their being illegal, would be as likely to mount a chemical weapons attack against civilians as a pseudo-democratic totalitarian dictatorship which commits war crimes on a weekly basis. The latter is far more likely and so the onus of evidence must reflect that."
"No, its not obvious. Syria has been called out and investigated for using chemical weapons, and the U.S. has been called out and investigated for using depleted uranium rounds (not that those are chemical/radiological weapons, but whatever), among a whole lot of other things in Iraq.

What's the double standard?"
"I remember, and can understand the logic, especially after seeing events unfold in Iraq and Libya. The US public's desire to become more entangled in the Middle East was extremely low. On the flip side, the rebels may have stood a much better chance had we done so...But hindsight is 20/20. I'm sure the former president now sees his decision as a mistake. "
Republicans threatened Obama that if he did anything in Syria resulting in an American death they would impeach him.
"> I think the concept was that a bombing on a rebel group released the the chemical weapons they had stockpiled. 

Except Sarin isn't stored that way, in completed ""ready to deploy"" mode. It's a mixture of at least two agents that are stored separately, in separate canisters. The explosion would have to not only rupture both canisters, but also perfectly mix the two binary agents once released, instead of just burning them up as is much more likely.

Seriously, high explosives is a terrible payload for releasing poison gas, as it tends to just burn up the gas. Terrorist movements experimenting with chlorine gas IEDs found this out in Iraq, when their bombs barely released any of the chlorine and instead just destroyed most of it. Syria's chemical bombs on the other hand contain just enough explosives to rupture the bomb's outer shell and release the gas, which is why so many relatively intact chemical shells have been recovered after a bombing."
The concept isn't based on any reality though. Bombing a sarin stockpile doesn't release the gas and kill people - it explodes and creates a huge fireball. 
"> I think the concept was that a bombing on a rebel group released the the chemical weapons they had stockpiled.

I think there was a lot Bannon did that hot him kicked out. 
"That's already been debunked, that's not how it works. A missile strike on a sarin stockpile results in it blowing up. "
"No they've never had the capacity to bomb every rebel town and that's not the point either. The point is the chemical attack coincided exactly as the site was bombed by the Syrian airforce, quite some coincidence."

"The Syrian Civil War was a multi-faceted conflict that involved nearly 1,200 militias, not all of them were ""terrorists"". Most were small groups of dozens of fighters defending their homes. Even the [current map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Syrian_Civil_War_map.svg) shows that their are still 5 separate factions in this war. Ever faction, including the Assad Government, is using forces that have been accused of being terrorists.  

The Turks are directly helping the FSA rebels right now in the Al-Bab and Afrin areas. Eastern Ghouta, which Assad has been accused of killing over a thousand with [Chemical weapons](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24130181), fights Al-Nusra, ISIS and the Assad Government. 2 Days after the CIA stated that they would [no longer provide weapons](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/world/middleeast/cia-arming-syrian-rebels.html) to Syrian rebels groups, Russia called the same fighters ""moderates"" and began to make deals with them to de-escalate the conflict. The cease-fires have fallen apart, and there are still ongoing clashes, and the Assad regime  attacked with [chemical weapons](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-weapons-ghouta.html) there as recently as two weeks ago. 

[""The move came after Russia, an ally of the government, said it had reached an agreement with ""moderate"" rebels to de-escalate conflict in the area.""](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40691000)"
That's not how sarin is stored (unless you want it to denature very quickly). The video footage from the site doesn't corroborate any sort of bombed out sarin lab either. This wouldn't make sense because the sarin is the same sarin held by the Syrian Arab Army.  The only possibility is the chemicals were deliberately mixed just as the aircraft bombed the site and somehow all evidence destroyed. The evidence shows the chemicals were contained in a KhAB-250 bomb (specifically designed to carry sarin) which exploded on the site at the time the jet flew there. There's no real prospect of this being executed by anything other than a military aircraft.
It wasn't the ones they were looking for.. 
Except planes were taking off from that airfield the next day. If that doesn't count as useless I don't know what does.

It doesn't point fingers directly but it does place the source of the chemical from ""government sources"". The mandate of the investigation wasn't to point fingers, just to ""discover the facts"". Presumably in an effort to be as impartial as possible.

> Unless I missed it, it doesn't seem to support your comments regarding launchers and territory though.

Regarding the rockets, I remembered it incorrectly - it's not directly from the UN report but the [Human Right's Watch report](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/syria_cw0913_web_1.pdf). It's implied though, since the UN report identifies the same 330mm rocket that HRW notes is only capable of being launched by Iranian-made Falaq-2 launchers (i.e. there is only one system that can fire 330mm rockets).

Regarding the territory however, if you look at the [report](http://www.un.org/zh/focus/northafrica/cwinvestigation.pdf) there were two separate impact sites (1 and 4) where the trajectory of the rockets can be accurately predicted, and they converge on a government held area.

All these groups have fought each other. There are dozens of different militias that fight among themselves, which is why this is considered a multi-faceted war. At least provide a source to back up your claims, if you think I am wrong.

Hezbollah isn't the only terrorist group that the regime cooperates with. This also includes the current allegiance with the [SSNP](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/06/behind-the-terror/376326/), a terror group famous for assassinating Lebanese government officials and the first use of female suicide bombers in the Middle East. They are now the [second largest legal political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Social_Nationalist_Party#The_SSNP_in_Syria) in Syria. 

The Assad regime has in its past supported many different terror groups in the region from The Jihad Council in Lebanon, Hamas/other Palestinian terrorist groups, the PKK against Turkey, to Iraq Baathist groups/[Al Qaeda in Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fawzi_Mutlaq_al-Rawi#Iraq_War), when they were [killing American troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Abu_Kamal_raid) a decade ago. This was a major reason that so many of Syria's neighbors sent arms to opposition groups when Assad seemed so weak in 2011. The allowance of so many different Jihadist and Baathist insurgents to use Syrian territory during the US-Iraq war made the situation even worse.

So Russia and the regime are willing to negotiate and cooperate with Al-Qaeda/terrorists temporarily? That is by the narrative that you are pushing, which doesn't speak to well of either Russia or the Syrian Government. Idilb is also still controlled by a myriad of different militias, and the regime has yet to consolidate this area. I think you are meaning the Palmyra to Raqqa assault, which was a push East and not North. The major Northern push by the regime stopped in 2016, after the capture of Aleppo.

It's evidence. Even if it's not evidence that wholly supports particular narratives at the very least the video footage is evidence that men dressed as white helmets seem to be engaged in nefarious activities including the staging of atrocities. The video footage is evidence that the Syrian boy is alive and well. To add, whether coerced or not the fact that his father gives an incriminating statement suggesting that the opposition are trying to use people as pawns for their propaganda is also telling. 

Recently a Russian Sukhoi 25 was shot down over Syria. The downing was caught on video. That video has been plastered all over the MSM as evidence of the downing of the plane. Because video footage of an actual event is video evidence of the event occurring. Video evidence.

>I'm not the one spreading bullshit youtube videos and claiming it to be ""evidence""

Bullshit youtube videos containing video clips that amount to evidence exposing the activities of one Western sponsored group in Syria, and video footage seemingly derailing the narrative put forward in the Syrian boy propaganda campaign waged by Western media outlets. Seemingly waged in an attempt to generate clamour in the West for direct intervention against Assad when the tables started to turn on the White helmet assisted Al-Nusra and affiliated groups in Aleppo.

Whatever you say dude.. You fail to realize the ""evidence"" is taken out of context. It is only evidence because you think it is. And because the narrators goal is to make you believe it is evidence.

There are NO proof in that video. Only allegations and made up bullshit. Let me repeat myself: Just because you tell a lie multiple times, it doesn't become truth.

We don't even know if it's the same boy! Or if the father is actually the father! And then i repeat: Russia is WELL KNOWN to do shit like that. Why should we trust them when every actual trustworthy source says the opposite ??
They could also have been paid! Or given a nice house out of the warzone. The fact is that they have not come forward themselves! They have been put in front of a camera for a reason! And that reason is to spread propaganda.

It's funny that you seem quick to attack a conspiracy source yet you have been the most invested in discussions about staged videos and now fake people.

"Nobody bothered to read the article apparently. The jobs are in Jordan itself, not Sweden. So this has nothing to do with immigrants or employment rate in Sweden.

Finally someone is making rugs from them. 
I stop reading the title after I saw selling rugs. I love rugs. Im down with buying rugs.

It's only being sold as a civil war. We're balls deep in it though. It's a proxy war.

The URL says it all. That's a whopping ~99.7% unemployment rate. Those who can't/don't find work still get all the refugee benefits in decent amounts. Can't blame them for that either, why work when the country pays you enough to live normally every month? But the issue is that it's putting an enormous amount of pressure on Sweden's government budget. They need to make sure the capable refugees do something, even if it means flipping burgers at McDonald's or being janitors. Incentivise them to work and earn for themselves. Whatever happens, the current system is unsustainable. Something needs to happen."

"Cheap labor (you know they won't pay refugees the same as citizens)

Good PR for helping refugees work (even though it kinda taking advantage of them)

Sell rugs at a higher cost, or offer some donations to the refugees for purchase (netting them more money overall, and even if they are 100% proceeds go to the refugees, they will still make more money from additional purchases along with the rugs)

Sounds like a win, win, win for IKEA.

Slave labor
Ikea is just exploiting cheap labor.If people think those refugees have the same benefits as anyone else you are dilusional.
"Just read ""IKEA sells drugs..."" And I begin to understand lot of things."
"Remember when people said that Europe just wanted a slave labour marketplace to replace their inconvenient workers with rights?

"Ikea can care less.. if one works itself dead, just drag it's corpse out back and push in the new refugee. If they could get away with it, they'd work them til they drop and bury them in a mass grave. Corporations like that can care less. If they give the refugees benefits and same pay, then that's different..."
"So they're hiring based on demographics instead of qualifications. But they're Muslims and refugees, so that makes it OK to just throw meritocracy out the window for the sake of virtue signalling, right?

And by the way, if you think that Ikea is going to give these people the same amount of pay and benefits as they do their Western employees, you are very, very wrong. Ikea is a business, and this is a business decision. It is a cynical and calculated PR stunt that is designed to prey upon your compassion."

We can no longer sustain the growth and put stability at risk by not allowing other countries to grow and evolve. Mexico is hurting so badly because they trying to keep pace with developed nations and they're receiving no help from the US. They need jobs to or their people will continue to illegally immigrate to the US. 

However, if we work with Mexico to improve their economy, beef up their GDP, and improve their overall quality of living it would not only reduce illegal immigration but would open up an entirely new market and business opportunities for the US allowing US based companies the ability to grow and expand into the Mexican market far better than they can now.

Wait... Trump did nothing to help people for decades? Oh, that's right, his publicity stunts usually involve insulting people, not helping them.

As far as I'm concerned, Ikea has already done a lot more to help refugees than Trump. All he's done is ban them from our country and kill a few innocent civilians from their country.

> And it all comes down to th fact that Trump's election was the best scenario that could have happened to Syrian people.

Very debatable. Trump has already hurt them and only seems intent on hurting them further. Russia having full control of Syria isn't a good thing for them.

>Unless of course you believe that ISIS is better than Saddam or Qaddaffi and the Taliban Mujaheedin better than the Communists.

You realize Trump has already heavily empowered them in just a week and a half, right?

He made it easier for ISIS to recruit and made it harder for refugees to escape.

He's done zilch to help refugees, and he's bolstered terrorist groups.

So go ahead, you support the terrorist hero of America, I'll be over here continuing to call him out as an embarrassment for the country.

They rabidly defend a disgusting Cheeto covered fuck knuckle who said John McCain was not a war hero. Then they have the audacity to pretend like they are the all mighty defenders of the armed forces when a liberal company has the gall to help a group of people who happen to not be veterans. 

For anybody who hasn't read about McCain's time as a POW - I implore you to read his page on Wikipedia. He was captured after his jet crashed. Then he nearly drowned before North Vietnamese soldiers dragged him out of the water. Already badly injured, he was badly beaten and interrogated. He never cracked and never gave them the information they wanted.

About 6 months later, they offered to release him because his father was an Admiral, and it would be good propaganda. He refused because he didn't want to leave his fellow soldiers.

Then he spent another 5 years in captivity - enduring further brutal beatings and interrogations. 

Say what you want about the man's politics. But, he is a God dammed war hero. To support a Presidential candidate that said what he said about a war hero, then to act like they give a shit about our veterans - it is disgusting. But I wouldn't expect anything less out of these people."

Most people don't care who makes the stuff they buy. I bet you a majority of those who do will see the benefits of employing refugees. There is no objective truth to who *should* produce these products, the current underpaid workers or the refugees it is only opinion. A lot of people will see it as a great thing for many reasons.

Yes, it would probably be best if they paid these people more. But I would argue that employing refugees is most likely better than what they are already doing."

According to the source the majority actually said they wouldn't go for the cheaper option. But yes there is a working economic around cheaper goods that exists. 
That is not how the study was structured. Consumers were given brand options at varying prices and sustainability factors and compared against a scale of how likely they would be to purchase or recommend. It was spread out from ingredients to promoting certain causes like the tom's model etc. there are also several other studies over the last couple years that had similar results (cone communications and blackbaud are two I remember off the top of my head)

Also, I should have mentioned that many of the reports I have read like this are not just a scaled study (which I would like to point out that a valid scale was used... aka has been used in other studies to measure things like ""most likely to buy"" and validity often weeds out bias tests).

??? Syria was already a very poor country before the war. This damage will take a century to recover. Or it may never recover and be in a state of perpetual warfare, recovery, myriad strongmen, and then collapse. Unless Syria is completely annexed by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, or other Islamic power, it is doomed to be a low growth nation and will remain a destitute country for years to come."
"I wonder if Assad, Putin, Trump, or Obama give any shits at all."
Well the US economy is $16 trillion and the Syrian civil war has been going on for 6 years so $96 trillion total and a $226 billion loss to the US economy would be 2.3% so I could see it being chalked up to a rounding error.
What are you talking about?! The SDF is exactly the type of person you want replacing Assad!

"Legitimacy is not based on the ""ability"" of being toppled. There can be legitimate dictators, there can be dictators toppling a legitimate government and then govern said country as an illegitimate government.

it's important to distinguish between legitimacy in a moral and legitimacy in a judicial sense; but the (legally) legitimate government of Syria is without a question Assad's government, which, by the way, also means that the only legitimate (foreign) war party in Syria is Russia since Russia was invited by Assad as support. "

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_%28political%29?wprov=sfla1

Legitimacy confers the right and acceptance of an authority, and rebels certainly wouldn't call Assad's government legitimate. People who are pro-Assad, though, would. Legitimacy isn't an objective phenomenon. 

However, *we* can't actually say whether Assad's government is legitimate in virtue of the fact that it was ""legally"" the government. The *legal* aspect is determined by the government anyway: no government would say they themselves are illegal, otherwise they wouldn't be a government. 

This means our sense of ""legal legitimacy"" for Assad's government comes from our conceptions of some international order or *law*. This would be fine, but that can't grant legitimacy -- even if say, the UN declared Assad's government legitimate. This is because *we're* not the ones being governed by Assad. We can't speak for the political legitimacy of the government as a result. 

The upshot is that the ""legal legitimacy"" you're endorsing here is a vacuous notion. A company or an institution can have the property of being ""legally legitimate"" if the law --that is the government -- grants them this. But a government itself can't: it cannot self-certify its own legitimacy by fiat. That's something the governed decide on, which is why people are motivated to topple oppressive regimes.  "
"Nice word salad you got there. Who is talking about ""legitimacy in a legal sense""? Is ""legitimacy in a judicial sense"" even a thing? No. This word is always meant in a moral sense. You're mixing ""internationally recognized"" and ""legitimate"", which are not the same thing. 

Also, why is the government of Assad ""without question"" legitimate? Just read up about how this dictator came to power through his father, how his father came to power, imagine this happened in your country, and let me know if would consider that legitimate.

>controversial Libya campaign

Should have thought about it after Iraq itself.

>How can you say Assad is a good idea to put back in charge

Assad has Russian and most importantly Iraqi, Lebanese and Iranian backing, Turkey has mostly given up on his ousting because  of their conflict with the Kurds, and Assad is on good terms with the Kurds themselves, even Egypt is somewhat apprehensive in supporting rebels because some of their main factions such as Ahrar al Sham are directly linked to the Muslim brotherhood and several top positions of the umbrella group ""FSA"" is taken by Muslim brotherhood members.

now how exactly do you think SDF will bring stability to Syria? 

Do you know how many factions are fighting in the Syrian civil war? 
The main Kurdish backers are USA and we've all seen how well that works out, and do you know how many Kurdish factions are there? Turkey supports KRG and some factions of Kurds are involved in conflicts with the PYD. The Kurds can control Rojava because most og the Population is Kurdish but if they rule from Damascus the majority Arab population will not have it, Hell they were already unhappy that Alawites were ruling a majority Sunni country. Basically the Kurds do not have the backing necessary to hold entire Syria together, they have more enemies than friends."
"Look, I like the SDF, they are a clean group and are a model of what groups and I think it is time for Assad to move on, but it is unrealistic at this point for any other group to take over the governing of Syria, it will turn the country into a place worse than Libya."
">Carpet bombed, barrel bombed, chemical bombed. When it comes to war crimes against civilians, you name it Assad has done it.

Any creditable proof of that?"
"You realize that the majority of the SDF is currently made up of Arabs, right? Like I have no idea where you get this idea that it's just all Kurds. You really need to do some more research of what the SDF actually is before you assume that it'll be ""Kurds trying to stabilize Syria."" 

It's mostly Arab already and they do a damn fine job of meshing together. 

> Which investigation proved that Assad gave direct orders to kill civilians? was there even an investigation into this matter in the first place? before anything made sense the gulf states , and the west propped up the rebels like some kind of angels when they are clearly not.

> An my friend the Plan to oust Assad was in the books since 2005 by USA.

The US has a million plans. It has plans to dispose of a Canadian invasion or defend against an EU invasion, 2 of the world's least unlikely events. Don't take those ""plans"" too seriously.

People generally don't care who the fuck is running their country as long as they represent their interests, are competent and can lead to a generally growing economy."
"At this point it's unrealistic to make any type of suggestion for Syria and accept it to work out. Do you think the people of Syria will just sit there and accept Assad back in charge after what he's caused in Syria?

Syria has become the world's largest pawn in the world's most competitive game of 4 player chess and it's destiny is being decided by the people around it. Everyone's got a stake on the board and now it's just playing the best you can."
">The one where Syrian's civilian's obviously just decided to shoot themselves during protests, right? /s Jesus Christ, who the fuck else gave the orders then?

So i'm supposed to blindly believe that, even when Assad's ouster was planned in advance, even when Iraq was invaded on false pretense, even when Libya was bombed on lies?

And why the hell was a civil war started that killed half a million people in order to get rid of one person without even trying a political solution.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/10/ankara-calls-us-arming-of-kurds-fighting-isis-in-syria-a-threat-to-turkey

The Kurds need not be the majority, The number of Arabs rose recently because of Defections by the failing Rebels, and they are ""meshing together"" because of a common enemy in ISIS an US support, The Kurds are the ones doing the majority of the fighting as in Raqqa, and it's pretty clear that the Kurds will have more regional political influence if SDF takes the whole of Syria, because they are the ones who are calling the shots, they are more organized as YPG is a military wing of PYD while the Arabs are mostly militias and SDF is led by SDC which is an umbrella organization which rejected Geneva peace talks in 2016 because PYD led group was not invited which means PYD hold massive influence on SDF and SDC and that is the thing that matters not numbers.

Misleading comparison - Assad has to keep paying his troops if he wants them to keep fighting for him. 
"Given the choice, I'll take the US's dysfunctional government over Syria's functional one."
"This is all fine and dandy, and I hate to break up this world news circlejerk while simultaneously burning the BBC (actually, i love it), but Syria's inflation is 50%+ and they're literally just printing nearly useless currency to pay their employees."
"Don't get me wrong, I really think the US is in a stupid situation. But the reason they are stuck in this situation is because of DEMOCRACY (no matter how flawed the implementation is). Something Syria doesn't have. "
To be fair the same thing was true during the American civil war.  
Civil War?  Oh I thought Assad said it was western backed terrorists... hmm...
Its much easier to make decisions when pesky things like public opinion and human life don't concern you.    The BBC is not making a far comparison here.  
Burn...
"If only the US would gas its population, we could avoid this like Syria does. Good logic OP! All countries should follow Syria's example."
this seems to be the kind of thing that happens when we don't have civil wars.  It's not as damaging either.
Nobody ever said dictatorships were inefficient.
Our civil war is taking place on the floor of Congress.

any way, the conclusion from what Anthony Zurcher say is that Obama need to appoint his brothers and cousins to government positions, have only his close sect in power in an apartheid regime and shot at protesters when they protest the vast corruption in the country."
"What a stupid comparison. We are perfectly able to pay government workers, we just decided not to."
This seems like a pretty obvious thing to point out. If the Syrian government stopped paying its workers who would support them?

All the while, we will continue to devolve into a police state void of any personal freedom until the creditor comes to collect."
"False equivalency. In Syria, Assad is a dictator and there is no division over such things. Furthermore he had better pay for his government staying open, or the apparatus he other wise rules would also rebel, including his military. 

None of those variables exist in the US. "
Assad for speaker of the house?
"No fuck that, that is not a proper and valid comparison you can make. "
I think this makes it clear that the solution is to gas the House Republicans.
Guaranteed the US government payroll is a hundred fold larger than Syria's even with this shutdown. This doesn't mean anything.
"Because if they didn't pay them they would go with their conscience or with the rebels out of desperation. A civil war makes paying people money more of a necessity, not less."

They only want to smash and burn."
I would prefer the Ba'ath party to the fucking tea party at this point.
100% behind the government shutdown. If they have a problem with it they shouldn't be trying to ram legislation like obamacare through nationally. For you snooty europeans just imagine the EU dictated completely privatized health care for all of its member states due too a 53% vote. 
Call me crazy but I still prefer my government over an apartheid regime.

"The problem with large numbers of political parties is that they almost always dwindle down to two parties in the end. One party will eventually get an advantage over the rest. Then the smaller parties will start to conglomerate to beat the popular party. This process continues until there are 2 parties. 

edit - I was speaking in the context of american politics since this is a thread about the american government. I am aware that there are proportional representation systems in the world. My response was to op, not the world at large. We don't need more parties per se we need a political system that *encourages* participation."
"Except that this is the result of a clash WITHIN one party, and not BETWEEN parties. It's a few nihilistic zealots driving this shutdown inside the Republican Party. There is nothing the other party could've offered to placate these loonies. "
"What the fuck does this have to do with the government shutdown? Intellectual laziness at its finest Reddit. This isn't the fault of both parties. It isn't even the fault of one party. It's the fault of a small segment of one party that has exorbitant power given our narrowly divided government. You have that phenomenon no matter how many parties you have.

A small group of Republicans are refusing to let the spending bill come to a vote. That's who you blame. If you toss up your hands in the air and blame everyone, then no one has an incentive to do the right thing.

"Do you have an example of a nation where this happened?
Most of the european countries have a multi party system and all I'm seeing over there is a slow increase in parties. Every little activist notion eventually gets a party build around it. Even the pedo's once started a party."
"In Europe it's quite common to have multiple political parties. The smaller parties tend to get a disproportionate amount of influence if they manage to hold the deciding votes, which happens quite often.

There doesn't seem to be anything inherent in multiple-party systems that makes them tend towards two-party systems (for instance, this is not happening at all in any Scandinavian country. In both Norway, Sweden and Denmark there exist significant political parties that are at most a few decades old).

However, some things drive the number of political parties down towards two, such as [first-past-the-post voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting). 

The US seems to have a system that drives towards a binary winner/loser result instead of a division of mandates proportional to the popularity of the different parties."
"This doesn't really happen if you switch to a proportional representation system http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation with a low cut-off for election. 

That would result in a fair number of smaller parties also getting candidates elected. Of course, this system also has issues (e.g. Sometimes you end up with unstable coalition governments)"
"No, that only happens when your election system is as it is. "
"> Except that this is the result of a clash WITHIN one party, and not BETWEEN parties.

"I don't know why everyone is so afraid of being considered bias for pointing out the truth. The whole ""both parties are to blame"" mentality is so ingrained in some people that it's getting ridiculous. "
"I'm still amazed at this situation. Congress took advantage of a period of single party ownership and passed a bill knowing the GOP disapproved. Quickly power returned to both parties in congress, as it should be, and there is a backlash.. surprise surprise! This situation is being reported and discussed without context."
"Political parties which are able to gain votes in any part of your country.

Poland was communistic country with one party system... they were able to transform it into multi party system in few months. It took few years to stabilise political scene (plenty of pointless tiny parties were created in the beginning of 1990's) but by 2000 we had only 4 large parties and few smaller.
"Plurality voting systems tend, according to [Duverger's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law), to create two-party systems. Of course there are counterexamples to that law like the UK, but it seems to be valid in case of the US.

Many european countries use proportional representation, which makes a two-party system less likely."

This is an intriguing idea. Say you had a coalition of right wing parties consisting of many different factions -- Christian conservatives, neocons, and Tea Parties, for example. They could band together and hold a majority in Congress. Maybe even give themselves a name like ""the Republicans"". Then something like this would never happen!

Oh wait, this is literally what happens now, except that you skip the step of forming a coalition since they naturally form under one party or the other."
"It doesn't really work in Canada.

In the states, you have to register to vote. This registration basically establishes your residence with the governing (state, not federal) election board.

When you register to vote, you have the option of declaring your membership in a political party. This is the method the parties use to declare their numbers. In some states, if you haven't declared for a particular party, you can't vote in that party's primary elections.

">You think American politicians and heads of multinational US based corporations want to give up control of the global economy? So, sure, we will adapt when we have to. But until then the USA will fight (literally) to keep control.

>You don't think we are suddenly interested in Syria because we care about human rights abuses, do you?

I think Russia is interested in Syria because it's their only military base in the Mediterranean and their only warm-water naval base in general. I also think they are interested in maintaining Gazprom's stranglehold over Europe's natural gas/etc. market, which they've wielded as a weapon in the past when in negotiations with European countries, and which they've used to threaten and intimidate Eastern European countries that are considering joining the European Union *(they are currently doing this, as we speak, with Ukraine)*. 

I believe the United States is against both of those. As in, the limiting of Russian military influence and power projection, as well as the possibility of establishing a pipeline through Syria directly to Europe. 

I also believe that the United States wish's to set a precedent when it comes to the use of chemical weapons, hence Obama's *""red line""* and the reason he's agreed to the present disarmament deal, even if it means giving up on the other two objectives I listed above. 

You don't think we are suddenly interested in Syria because of a singlular reason, do you? You can't possibly think that this issue isn't multi-faceted and complex, and that the world isn't simple or black-and-white, right?

And even if they decided to shred incoming cash and print new bills in exchange, they would still need to tax. If they, instead, just printed the money, it would lose value rapidly (see: Japan a couple decades ago). Taxation, even if it results in new bills instead of old ones held by the government, allows them to collect revenue while not ruining the value of the currency."

The Fed can do whatever, the results are not as mechanical. There's also the case of Japan, which also has been doing similar things for decades, also no hyper-inflation.

This is all irrelevant though, the case still remains that the US government does not need to tax anyone or do anything in order for it to pay whoever it wants in US dollars. They make them.

I think you're missing the point here. The bill has already been passed (Affordable Care Act), and with that bill was the funding. They are causing this entire shutdown because they want to defund a program that has already been funded by law. "
"Depends on how every other party voted though. You could say that, but then had the voting been unanimous, does it really make a difference?"

That's what we have right now though. 40% of the vote (aka the loudest minority) has the loudest voice. 60% of the vote can't stop 40% from doing what they want, even if they teamed up, unless they do it during election season. I don't know how you can look at that and say it's fine.

"Where does it say they can't do that? 

Democrats used the opportunity of controlling both chambers to pass Obama's signature bill that wouldn't pass otherwise. Now the Republicans are using this opportunity to kill it.

To suggest the Republicans are completely at fault is just short sighted. The Democrats created this situation in 2009.

">Do you think maybe there would be some backlash from the Democrats when they took back the House or Senate?

If they took back Congress, sure. But only the House? What's the point in ""backlashing"" if they know they're not going to get what they want? The people did not put them in control of the Senate or Presidency this last election. Perhaps they should accept that they are a minority on this issue and stop trying to reverse a law by shutting down the government?

This is 100% the Republican's fault. I hope the Democrats don't cave on anything because they shouldn't have to. They are the majority opinion right now and the majority rules. If Republicans want to reverse the Affordable Care Act then they should bring *that* to a vote, not block funding to the federal government. "
But that's the thing. We have the same system. We use FPTP just like them. The only difference being they elect a president instead of appoint a governor general. But it's the same god damn thing.
"Bring it to a vote? You know that it would pass just like the ACA wouldn't have passed a bipartisan Congress. Your correct in saying that the people put Democrats in power during that time, but now the people have put Republicans in the House. I hope the Republicans don't cave either... Let the voters sort it out in the upcoming elections."

Also I'd argue that gerrymandering and redistricting put Republicans in the House but that's a road I won't go down twice today. "
"And those differences are largely pedantic and have no effect on how the voting system works. They still use FPTP. We use essentially the same thing as the electoral college. People elected to office choose their party head to be PM. The person with the most votes, wins. Yes, the GG is largely irrelevant as a puppet of the PM, but serves the same role as the President of the US, he is just more likely to exercise his power."

Gerrymandering happens on both sides of the isle. BTW Gerrymandering was named after Elbridge Gerry... a liberal."

So because of redistricting we are having this budget debate?
See my previous comments about Canada's multiple parties and their influence on Canada's more progressive policies.
"lol ""debate.""

There's no debate. This is a big show that will end with nothing gained for either side. The Affordable Care Act will continue to be law, with full funding, and the Republicans who caused this shutdown will probably continue to look for more dramatic tactics to blow up in their face.

This is nothing more than a minority of teabaggers trying to secure their place in their districts where only other teabaggers claiming to be more conservative will run against them. Why the Republican party, particularly Boehner, goes along with it is beyond me.  "

The legislation elevated FEMA to special status within the Department of Homeland Security, much like the Coast Guard and designated the head of FEMA to be the President's point person during an emergency. The bill also called for the reunification of the preparedness and response functions within FEMA, giving it responsibility for all phases of emergency management. And the measure strengthened FEMA's regional offices, creating dedicated interagency ""strike teams"" to provide the initial federal response to a disaster in the region. The legislation passed Congress in September 2006. As the 2007 hurricane season approached, Senator Lieberman held an oversight hearing on implementation of the FEMA reforms on May 22, 2007.

Well, that is to be expected when the Assad regime was using chemical weapons including sarin gas initially until we appeared to be on the brink of taking military action with ships off the coast, but then our Congress (with American pressure weary of getting involved in yet another country) voted no. The Russians got politically involved at that point worrying about potential American involvement and made the Syrians destroy much of their sarin gas, but they just moved on to using chlorine gas I believe.

Aside from that, Russia got militarily involved a few months ago (September I believe) and the Assad regime has been indiscriminately bombing in order to create a refugee crisis which would make it easier for the regime to eventually kill all of their enemies with Russian support. This is why Russia has been attacking the rebels closest to Assad-controlled territory and not the eastern part of the nation where ISIS is located.

Who do you think caused this situation in the first place by arming thousands of Syrian rebels?
What? Are you capable of blaming anyone but the west? When does Israel get Syrian land?
Since when has Israel made any moves to annex lands in Syria in the past 5 years? As far as I know they have not made a single move to occupy anything beyond the Golan Heights (which they already held before it started).
You say this like the war in Syria doesn't get TONS of attention in the US. 
"It's startling to think about: imagine ten of your friends and loved ones.

"> Thanks to the USA starting this war and arming ISIS. Without Putin and Assad bringing stability it would be even worse.

You are so wrong. 

This civil war started because civilians opposed the regime during Arab spring (March 2011). Assad deployed the army and ordered a massive crackdown on a peaceful demonstration in Hama causing hundreds of civilians to be killed (May 2011). Regime forces start cracking down peaceful demonstrations in Damascus (Feb 2012) and regime troops push into Homs to terrorize civlians opposing the Assad regime (April 2012).

Then in July 2012 Assad regime starts bombing civilians and the UN (Aug 2012) accuses Syria of war crimes. By Nov 2012 Rebel groups start to form to oppose the relentless Assad regime. 

Sep/Oct (2013) UN finds covincing evidence of chemical attacks by the Assad regime. In this time period Rebels form the Islamic alliance. By now public pressure has mounted on the US government to aid rebel groups not considered ""extremists"" who oppose the Assad regime as well as the Islamic State, this was late 2013 early 2014."
Thomas Jefferson.
"A ceasefire agreement doesn't mean much, especially not in this situation. 

Look at how well the multiple ceasefires worked in Ukraine. 

Not to mention that ISIS is one of the key players on the ground, so saying ""everyone important but"" means that it's not everyone important. The amount of territory and influence ISIS holds in Syria is nothing to be dismissed. "
The agreement was only between the US and Russia. No Syrian parties.
My comments are straight from a Syrian expert who works in DC and interacted with the Assad family directly so personally I don't see the big deal saying what I did. The people I get information from are those who actually know what they are talking about and do not have agendas. I don't talk just to talk. I could even give my sources if it is so important to you. I have a list of names.
But you aren't factoring in the massive amount of foreigners fighting there or people who have been injured multiple times. Most of government held Syria is safe and many places carry on as if there wasn't a war raging 50 miles away. I find it very hard to believe that 1/10 have been casualties.

"The Golan Heights was under Israeli military administration from 1967 to 1981. In 1981, Israel passed the Golan Heights Law,[14] which applied Israeli ""laws, jurisdiction and administration"" to the Golan Heights. Although the law in effect annexed the territory to Israel, it did not explicitly spell out the formal annexation.[106] The area is administered as part of Israel's North District. Israel's action was not recognised internationally[107] and United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 which declared the Golan Heights Israeli-occupied territory continues to apply. Israel maintains that it may retain the area as the text of Resolution 242 calls for ""safe and recognised boundaries free from threats or acts of force"".[16]"

"I think Erdogan was never keen on working toghetehr with europa anyway, and also, I don't think he really cares about NATO. Sure, the russians might be happy with all this, but surely it is Erdogan making the threats and moving into Syria. To top that off, instead of blaming the Americans for abandoning the Kurds, Europa should have a United European Army that could've been on the ground there too. It's easy to always blame the Americans, Russians or whoever for whatever, while europa Does'nt ever take any responsibility or action in order to prevent these things. Im no fan of Trump, but as a European I think we should have a long hard look at what our own role is in the world. Whatever interests there are in the middle east, we also need oil. I actually think all this is more to blame on Europa's naïvity, hypocrisy, and indecisiveniess. We should've taken a different course on the whole thing yeas ago."

"Im not saying Russia does'nt get it's way, I'm saying Europa should take care of itself."
That is where this gets kind of confusing. There is no formally written procedure to remove a nation from NATO. Or at least through anything I found so I can be wrong on this. So it doesn't seem like it is legally prohibited but still possible. Although it may take a significant push. The only thing I have found anywhere similar to the subject is formally withdrawing.

Maybe worry more about that corporate terrorism (which btw also applies to Europe) instead of the so called islamic terrorism which is mainly a distraction from the real problems in our societies. It's the same with immigration (which time and time again has to be shown to be economical beneficial in the mid to long term), it's used as distraction so we look elsewhere due to fear and don't reflect as society why we don't prosper more in average despite generating more than enough wealth."

"This is such a terrible take which exposes your complete lack of knowledge on the subject. Britain and France each took control of a swath of Arabia after dismantling the Ottoman Empire, and then proceeded to draw borders with zero regards to the ethnic and cultural  barriers, leading to tons of conflict. Dictators came to power, promising the populace that they would undo what the colonial powers had done; obviously they didn't, as dictators tend to lie for power. The British also took it upon themselves to mix things up a bit by establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, which, of course, the vast majority of the locals disapproved of. Large numbers of Arabs. Masses of Arabs evacuated from the region, which now had the support of both the U.S. and Soviet Russia, creating a refugee crisis in numerous Arab states. This is really just the tip of the iceberg, some of these conflicts can be mirrored with British partition of India."
"The conflicts are the result of that though. Those lines are more or less arbitrary and all those wars are about creating the ""real borders""."
"Well no, that'd be really dumb. And for the record I'm very much against Turkeys incursion into syria, as I am at any illegal foreign involvement in syria or anywhere else.

"The only way is if Turkey decides to leave. They can do it by themselves maybe or other NATO members have to bully Turkey out. Otherwise there isn't really a possibility of ""kicking"" anybody ""out""."

"> Those numbers are literally made up. Some closer numbers for example in Germany: 80m and 1m.

No, they are roughly how many refugees would likely come from the 3.5 million or so in Turkey and the population of the EU. 

Muslims are responsible for all tiny fraction of the murders in Europe. Even if we would allow in 4 million Syrian refugees it seems incredibly unlikely either the statistics for sexual assault and rape will change a lot or the murder rate.

Just like the Taliban were heroes for fighting the Soviets.
"They'd be lying. But if they were armed and attacking Europe and under Turkish control it's plausible one could use A5. 

However given that Erdogan is using force to keep them in Turkey it seems much more likely he would just stop the force being used to keep them in Turkey and they would leave by choice."
"> Sorry, illiterate.

Brave move, just before writing this lol :D

>  You'll have to post the declaration that wouldn't have many takers, if any, for the defense of Turkey by Syria after the invasion by Turkey.

So for clarity, article 5 talks about **armed** attack in Europe or North-Atlantic. Even if Turkey attacked America in Syria it would not be eligible for  NATO article 5 and joint self-defense. 

So neither the refugees, nor Turkey invading Syria nor the story of Turkey bombarding Americans in Syria would qualify.

"No. That would be like equating the PKK and YGP to all kurds which alot of reddit seems to do (even kurds from other countries like iraq where Turkey has had historically good relations with KRG and Peshmerga). The ties between YGP and the PKK are well known and they dont even try to hide it, they are both part of the Kurdistan Workers Union and have the same ideological founder, Abdullah Öcalan"
"No, there is no legal procedure. They cannot be voted out, they can only leave on their own accord or be bullied out"
"No. NATO would be required to help somehow, except if they simply decide to ignore NATO's core principle.

If they don't want to violate NATO and still not help Turkey, the ""best"" they could do is simply send small divisions for help and call it NATO protection."
"Why you are listing Somalia, Mexico, Micronesia, etc..? Turkey doesn't require visa from most of EU countries. And the ones who require visa a only e-visa that you can take within 5 minutes from internet. On the other Turkish citizens need to wait at least a week for appointment in a consulate, bring tons of paper, wait few weeks to get visa, which in many cases they cannot for simple reasons like ""last year you got a visa from us, this year you cannot"". And at the border they need to be questioned for 5 minutes such as why you are here? when you are leaving? show me your hotel reservation. show me your return tickets. do you have friends here? etc. On the other hand if you are EU citizen who requires e-visa (only about 8 countries) you can fly to Turkey, leave the plane, get an e-visa from your phone and enter to Turkey. No questions, you only need to pay several Euroes which is less than waht Turks pay. But if you are from the other members of EU, 20 countries, you enter to Turkey as if you enter to a concert, they only look to your passport, that's it."
"So now you're comparing ISIS to the Soviets? So Turks don't see what's different about a group that takes sex slaves, beheads little girls on the street, throws homosexuals off buildings, executes groups of teenagers for watching a football match, drowns people in cages, and wants to slaughter billions of people,?"
"and how do you decide that they are lying? maybe they can declare to be infiltrators, sent unarmed to make sleeping cells. Who are we to doubt that?"
"Invocations of article V are done by the nation under attack or a proxy.  Nations then assent or dissent their assistance.  Validity is piecemeal, but Turkey wouldn't be being attacked, Turkey was entirely the aggressor.  Turkey acting as aggressor on the US forces would qualify as the actions were done as an act against a NATO member, without provocation, while the US was acting as peacekeepers between Assad and the Kurds.  The reason it would apply if invoked is if the other signatories declined, they'd lose the major protector, not that the US is making war on Turkey, just a reality check on you.  Now, threatening a forced, mass migration of economic refugees is one thing, having an armed contingent use the migration as means (as undoubtable would happen) is an attack.  Erdogan made a huge mistake in Syria, we wish him well with his definitely not predatory Russian friends of whom Turkey will only become more dependent just before they eat his lunch."
"Because as Trump is finding out, it’s rather impossible to seal a border."
Historically good relationships? like having both barzani and talibani the leaders of the biggest parties of KRG on their terror list? and after alot of pressure of eu and america turkey caved to working with them. even treathening to invade krg. Also pkk's terrorist status has been heavily debated. With belgium outright removing them from the terror list and europe having a vote on removing them that got passed.
"NATO as a parliamentary body can declare an end to the inclusion of Turkey.  It's not just an up or down are we going to act on an official invoking protections, NATO can exclude if situations warrant.  Persona non grata is very easy.  Erdogan already ceded NATO protections by invading, exclusion would just be more formal."
"You should go read.  Members vote on article V.

Turkey invaded someone else.  If Russia helped that someone else invade Turkey, NATO is not required to act on the assertion of Turkey because Turkey created the conditions by invading their neighbor.  Now, toss on war crimes and banned weapons."
"I suggest you read some anti USSR propaganda from back in the day. 

And I didn't compare them."
"> Who are we to doubt that?

Anybody with a brain."
Is turkey really threatening to illegally dump refugees in the EU though? I would've though they'd be using the customs union to legally grant refugees access to the rest if the EU.
"My basis of historically good relations comes from  the timeline of the syrian civil war and the isis insurgencies. From everything I'd seen Turkey had good relations with the KRG and Peshmerga and co-operated with them against ISIS and PKK in Iraq, with reports of Peshmerga refusing to take part in offensives in Iraq because it was being lead by PKK (and maybe YGP too, cant remember for sure). The relations soured tremendously after the KRG's unilateral independence declaration.

In all honesty I dont think anyone can claim the PKK dont operate in terrorism (whether you agree with their cause and even some of their attacks against military targets or not) historically and possibly currently (more recent attacks have had some ambiguity behind who conducted them as I learnt from another comment thread a while ago). The PKK are still classified as a terror group in the UK, US, and EU as far as I'm aware, but most importantly in Turkey which is the relevant party to this issue"
"Username checks out.

>like having both barzani and talibani the leaders of the biggest parties of KRG on their terror list?

What the hell are you talking about. You literally pulled that out of your ass."
"That's not how it works. Show me the procedure in the NATO treaty which would allow to kick a NATO-member out.

If it's not in there, there is legally no way. NATO-members may do it regardless, but that would be illegal. Not that it's not possible, as countries are known to break laws, but it would be still illegal."
"That would still not be a kicking out.

Also, Turkey is very unlikely to be invaded for that by Russia. Russia is selling Turkey they weapons, it quite contra-productive to then do an invasion against them."
It could never be illegal anyway since people have the right to seek asylum as a human right.
"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/us-senators-file-bill-to-take-kurdish-groups-off-terrorist-organizations-list-64947

nope, you dont know shit apparantly. barzani's turkish party kdp-bakur is still banned in turkey. just look up banned parties in turkey."
"Not illegal.  Treaties are based on consent.  ""We no longer consent to war crime country, Turkey, being party to our treaty"" is entirely valid."
"Didn't claim a vote on article V claim is kicking out.  Claimed a vote could just as easily be called.

Depends on your goals.  If arming Turkey is so you can make them dependent, gouge, and know their armaments/training; I'd call it well done.  If gaining territory is your ultimate goal, dependency or invasion accomplish this goal.  If your goal is to remove US bases and nuclear armaments from Turkey, just the Turkish invasion will eventually accomplish this goal."
"They are running an entire entity in northern iraq, who gives a shit about some branch in turkey? That's not what having barzani and talabani* (lmao you called him talibani) on a terrorist list means."
"Not really. Not caring about treaties is just violating treaties, which is regarded as illegal.

That's like saying that if Russia said that just because it didn't consent to UN treaties anymore that Russia's actions are somehow less illegal."
"No, it's not a violation nor illegal to withdraw consent from nations being party to a treaty.  No, it's not a violation nor illegal to withdraw yourself from a treaty.

When people talk about illegal in the sense of nations it's stipulations in international laws of which our nations are signatories.  We call Russia's invasion of Crimea a violation of our code because it is an undeclared war masquerading as a secessionist movement despite large Russian involvement and some exceptional special forces teams.  Russia calls it a protective action defending ethnic Russians in Crimea.  The reality is Ukraine defaulted on over a year of energy imports from an oligarch run company and when Ukraine failed to pay, Putin declared the naval base and surrounding areas that Russia had been leasing annexed territory based on the dubious claim of needing to protect ethnic Russians.

You're confusing right and wrong with international law."
"The point is that when people talk about international law, they refer to UN law. That's the closes we have to international law. Not sure what you refer to ""our code"".

Under UN law, Russia posses Crimea illegally, because it violates Ukraine's sovereignty, similar how an independent Kosovo is illegal under UN law as it violates Serbia's sovereignty. In both cases the actions were unilateral.

Any other ""illegal"" is irrelevant, as every country can claim that something is illegal."
"We contend what they've done is illegal.  They declare they're in compliance with their own code and further are not in violation of ours because of human rights protections, legal means taken by the local population to self determine, and legal treaties to use the naval base.  Russia declared their actions in Crimea secondary to an uprising of self determining locals, they never ceded to unilateral action.

People make claims all the time, we're on the internet.  Relevance is always conditional.  If we were in China, saying Xinnie the Pooh at a cafe would be illegal.  If we were in Saudi Arabia, you could legally have Pakistani slaves building houses for you."
"good. we should help the YPG any way we can, since no one else seems to help them."
Turkey is gonna be pissed.

"Why would the US need these bases?

Aren't our 'allies' the Turks letting us use their air-bases?"
so how exactly is it legal under international law for the US to build bases in Syria without the permission of the Syrian government?
"Wait...did Assad, you know, the actual leader of Syria, approve this?!

Edit: I forgot. The US doesn't need approval from a sovereign nation to set up shop inside her borders. "
"Mission Accomplished.

?"
Imperialism.  Plain and simple. 
"This is an act of war against Syria and therefore all its allies, including Russia and Iran.  When will a nuclear blast burn all my skin off?"
this is another Neocon Amerikkkan Empire War for Oil.
"In my humble opinion, Turkey should read this excellent blueprint [How Can Turkey Overcome Its Foreign Policy Mess?](http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/) for a smarter foreign policy for Turkey by former senior CIA official Graham E. Fuller."

What is the campaign for revenge elin and cudi? Why are we avenging them?
"My understanding is that these new air bases close to the theater are mainly needed for ground attack helicopters for the upcoming huge battles for Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, and for delivery of supplies. Not sure if there is also a political rationale to use them for fixed wing fighter aircraft instead of existing air bases."
The inevitable treaty that creates Kurdistan.
Resupplying the SDF/YPG
"The Kurdish regions are entirely autonomous from Syria and have been so since before the civil war. 

Assad has no control anymore of that region."
You mean the war criminal who inherited the office from his authoritarian father? 
Did Assad approve of ISIS launching attacks on neighboring countries from Syria?
[removed]
"Presumably Russia (with who the US coordinate in Syria ever closer) will convince or aleady has convinced Assad to acquiesce. One of these two future bases, the one close the the Iraqi border, is already operated by the US for some months as a makeshift airstrip to deliver supplies to the SDF, and Assad had no comment whatsoever."

I think at this point both of them are just fucking done with Syria.
"No. The man whose pockets weren't as deep as those of the leaders of Saudi Arabia, America and Turkey. It was probably cheaper to kill the terrorists that this trio created than it was to pay them not to accept arms and get violent."
Better to have Assad in power than Al-Qaeda. 
"Quite frankly, I was rooting for all the countries that were going thorough the so called 'Arab Spring' and after the dictators were gone, almost in every scenario Islamists swooped in and fucked everything up or at least attempted to do so.

So maybe Syria is better off with Assad than any sort of Islamist crazies taking over.

"We, the super power, don't like that."
"According to Reddit, Assad had the rebels on the ropes during the summer.  Then the rebels made some advances.  Now the government is making advances.

"Turn back, all the comments here are shit."
Nobody likes a loser. Down down down the rebels are going down 
"Incompetent Obama drawing a ""red line"" to stop him pretty much guaranteed Assad would win. "
The tide of war has turned. Syria will remain Syria and the US will remain weak. 
"This is unsurprising, rebels don't often stand much of a chance"
Good!
For the sake of every religious and ethnic minority over there I sure hope so
"This is the complicated truth of the mess.  The rebels are not the good guys, Assad is not a good guy.  "
The cunt we know vs. the cunt who kills people because God told him to.
The most important thing imo is to bring some bloody order to the country. Sure Assad is a bitch but so are the rebels and the only way to stop the killing is basically for one side to win and to be honest at this point Assad is probably the better choice. The chance are that if the rebels win a new internal powerstrugle will begin with even more killings. 
"But at what cost? Hundreds of thousands of people leave the country at an unprecedented rate, thousands die, more are wounded. An entire generation lost.

There are no winners in war."
"If the Syrian government wins al Qaeda and affiliated organizations aren't going to disappear. The FSA could collapse, but the instability from economic failure that will likely persist for years in post-war Syria will turn the country into a haven for militant groups. Considering Shia militant groups are already allied with Assad, sectarian violence could be exacerbated. "
"If only Israel and US would had stayed out of it, it would already had been over with fewer deaths and destruction."
"Why exactly? He has killed 100,000 + civilians"
Why do you just assume Al Qaeda is so predominant to those wanting democracy - because the corporate media tells you so?
"Is necessary lesser of two evil concept is pretty hilarious on reddit as if it were applied anywhere else it would be decried as immoral. Israel has better human rights than the palis, US gov in Iraq had much better human rights than saddam. Clearly both are the good guys then!

Anyway, this whole ""A$$ad str00000ng!!!! Victory for great Assad any time now!"" Is pathetic and has been parroted for the last two years. If you could win a guerrilla war by taking ground guerrilla warfare wouldn't be effective."
Not really a difference 
"Easy to say that sitting comfortably 6,000 miles away. Assad is a butcher and a genocidal maniac and neckbeards like you want him back in power. Fuck you cocksucker, gashti ka bacha malunna"
"Yes. How unfortunate for those who wanted something different from Assad that protests became civil war, and war attracted Al Qaeda, now it is just better for everyone that Assad should be in power after all. May the Assad family and all their associated friends, in-laws, and cousins continue to run Syria forever, for the good of Syria and the world. "
"Maybe. On the other hand it seems like minority dictators like Assad staying in power might only postpone the inevitable, and deepen sectarian tensions.

Transitioning to a democracy is a hard thing to do. The kind of trouble Egypt is going through might be necessary for any culture that isn't adapted to self-governance."
"It's too soon to tell where the majority of revolutions are going. We tend to be pretty short-sighted about political and social change - if it doesn't happen NOW, we can't see it.

Take the long view. In this region, the most organized opposition is almost invariably Islamists of some sort. Secular dictatorship + majority Muslim tends to go that way. But not all Islamists are HAMAS. And, as we saw in Egypt, they might win the first election -- but they are *forced* to moderate and compromise when in power. That or attempt to seize power completely. 

But as we've seen, dictatorships are brittle: they have a tough exterior and can persist for long periods without pressure. But when the pressure comes, the slightest crack shatters the illusion. Democratic governance has different issues: the difficulty of consensus, the slow pace of change, infighting. In many ways the two forms are opposites -- dictatorship starts strong but becomes fragile, while democracy is delicate getting off the ground, but time strengthens it.

What I'm trying to say (in a disjointed fashion) is that these revolutions need time to show us where they are going. Yes, insecurity & instability will rise in the short-term. Policy should anticipate this. And some societies will not make the shift. But popular governance is the most stable system in the long-run. Remember, the first attempt at democracy in the US failed and took a decade to fix."
Assad staying in power only makes it more likely the zealots are going to get the upper hand over those wanting Syria to be a free country.
and assad is by no means a religious nut which is unique for that part of the world. best dictator eva!
"If Assad wins, it will be rebuilt. If the opposition wins it will not. That's the sad fact in Syria."
">no one has won

Good summation of the Syrian Civil War"
Putin was protecting his last ally in the region and he won't win the Nobel Peace Prize because of his controversial policies in Russia. Putin was scared that Obama would act upon his threat of force and saw no other alternative other than to force the Syrian government to capitulate to Obama's demands. 
"(Paraphrasing) Only in a world this sick could you even try to say that and keep a straight face.

This has nothing to do with peace. This is cynical geopolitical posturing. Only a willfully ignorant person could call a man like Putin - who has torn Chechnya limb from limb, who served in the KGB during their brutal heyday, who has had critical journalists and dissidents mysteriously die - 'peaceful'. "
Without Russian support Assad might have been toppled without the need for outside extremists to join the battle.
"Yep. He forced the West to back down, they were hoping to move in and no-fly zone the shit out of Syria."
"Putin outplayed the West *hard* diplomatically over Syria, but I think the US deserves *some* credit for swallowing our pride and coming to the table with the Russians over it.  

Hopefully it can be a model for future international relations where countries work together on the basis of shared objectives rather than operating to support/defeat different ideologies.  "
"WTF?

America has been on the rebels side since 2006 and has been tossing them large amounts of money and hooking them up with arms dealers to spend it. Citations [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1qrgee/fighters_from_an_alqaidalinked_syrian_rebel_group/cdfunwf); suggesting that Obama was fighting **against** Al Aqeda is a revisionist lie. "
"To be fair, he is actually a much better candidate for it than Obama."
So you're saying you liked Assad before it was cool?
"Hmm, not sure if your username is relevant, then."
"So let me follow the logic. Mass demonstrations break out across every major city in February 2011, demanding - not revolution - but REFORM. Internal security forces and the army are mobilized to smash protests, employing live fire and widespread torture. The protests intensify, with some calling for Assad to leave. Violence by regime forces continues rising. Not until JULY do groups begin arming, and even then, they limit actions to defending protests. Regime continues, and some factions begin raiding police HQs and attacking government forces.

We know that after this, it devolves into civil war and foreign fighters see an opportunity and flow in. But you *really* believe that the blame for the war lies at the feet of the first peaceful protesters in February 2011? And you *really* think people will forget that it was almost a year before foreign fighters were seen in Syria in any meaningful number? And, *honestly*, you see everything as the West's fault when - after sitting on the sidelines issuing 'firm condemnations' for more than two years - beginning to fund the moderate opposition? Even today, the US weaponry has not been delivered in the numbers promised; even more devastating to your logic, the US is actively preventing certain weapons from entering Syria.

This is quite literally laughable. You've intentionally misread the conflict and now try to peddle the bullshit here. It might make your binary brain feel good, but no matter how hard you try, reality isn't going to agree with you."
"Why do you support a dictator who authorises his forces to beat up and kill anyone who dares criticize him?

He is absolutely a good guy in this context. Religious freedom and equality for women trumps islamist democracy.
"I think it's a bit of an incorrect generalization to say that the rebels are not the good guys. There are plenty of moderate rebel groups fighting Assad, they just don't have any backers. Salafi groups are funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, while Al-Qaeda is funding several jihadist groups like al-Nursa. America is funding just enough moderates to maintain a balance, but even that's not enough to stop Assad's momentum."
My western main stream media brain can only comprehend a good guy bad guy narrative! Why must the world not work in simple black and white! 
"I don't understand how people can favor one terrorist group over another.  Assad is plenty brutal.  His philosophy is ""cut off the leg, to save the man.""  He will kill any number of people to keep his family in power.

And you're going to tell me that's *better* than the rebels?  Why are the rebels bad?  Because they kill people?  How is that worse, or different?"

If no one helped us... and literal YEARS passed with friends and family being gunned down in the streets... yeah, I'd damn sure take any help I could get from anyone who would offer it.  A deal with one devil for hope of beating another.
 
But whatever.  ""We didn't get involved so no one can blame us, it's not our fault.""  Seems to be the driving morality of the age now.  "
"The rebels are not Al Qaeda. You are a slave to media good job thinking as you are told. Move along now, nothing to see in the corpse-strewn cities of Syria..."
"""At what cost relative to Islamist rule?"" This is the question you should ask."
"Nope, but when you're stuck with the better of two evils, you're going to have to choose which one is less dangerous to the world.  Assad's the guy.  It's an ugly calculation, but, in the end, it's a pretty simple utilitarian one."
There are bigger losers however.
"It's a shame that you're getting down-voted.  The Syria situation exemplifies ""war is hell.""  More so because regardless of who wins, they'll be left with a shitty government.

They're getting torn apart *and* are going to be left worse off in the end.

Tragic."
Assad did not waste resources to pointlessly hunt and kill every single civilian casualty in this civil war.

"Agreed.  But the point we should be taking from this is that dictatorship is **not** a long-term solution.  Eventually it will crack, and when that happens it will not be pretty.  So all this arguing that ""Assad is needed for stability"" is short-sighted nonsense.  And besides, what the fuck is Syria now?  Stable?!  Assad means perpetual warfare.  And bloodbaths like this are only going to increase in frequency with the advent of social media which gives his opponents an increased ability to organize."
if the rebels win.   Somalia 2.0
Ask Hama if the Assads are builders. Ask them if they invest in infrastructure or civil works outside of Damascus and Alawite areas. Ask them if Syria was a land of milk and honey before the rebellion.
it will take a long time i read somewhere that the damages have already surpassed the countries entire GDP.
"It is the sad fact in any developing middle eastern country that overthrew their dictators through a violent war, Egypt, Libya, Iraq, etc. The new ones who occupies the power vacuum won't just magically be the perfect moral rulers (moral in the western sense as well), as much as the popular imagination would want it to be."
"If Assad wins, he will massacre thousands of civilians and commit ethnic cleansing. Please don't delude yourself."
Why did Obama win a Nobel Peace Prize?

Bravo."
"The US government was forced to back down because many citizens and countries were against it AND Assad just played Obama perfectly by releasing the interview where he clearly said that US was welcome to come and take his chemical weapons.

After that, they couldn't find any other excuse."
I still suspect that the whole Kerry debacle was just a really clever plan concocted by Russian and US diplomats to resolve the situation with everyone saving face.

"Most estimates I've seen put the hardline islamists as 10-20% of overall rebel forces. Now these groups are influential, which is worrying, and are seen to be the most effective fighters but they are certainly not in overall control of the opposition. Their participation in the conflict really does seem over exaggerated on here and in some of the media.

Saying that though many of the other rebel groups are no saints either and have been hardened over the years with these groups committing atrocities as well.

In short I believe that neither one side or the other should be allowed to take complete control with the best option probably being a balanced compromise between the two sides with certainly the removal of the Assad family from the equation as they are unacceptable to most of the opposition."
Uh no they're Mossad lol.
"> their replacements are a bunch of Islamic psychopaths.

You are doing a terrible job at spreading western propaganda
"Oh rly? Any sauce on that? And no i do not take conspiracy youtube videos as source. 

"
Not all of the rebels are but sects of the rebels are Al Qaeda.  Usually the craziest sects take power.
The most powerful and influential rebel groups are Al-Qaeda affiliated Islamists like ISIS and Al Nusra. 
I agree with you - interesting how a group of pro-Assad shills have managed to intimidate others here into submission.
"No amount of lives is worth it, to keep one brutal regime over another (speculatively brutal regime) just because the other is Islamist.  Both sides will kill for power.  So why not have Assad go down now instead of dragging this on indefinitely.

Have people actually thought about this?  You're honestly going to tell me Assad is better.  How many people does he get to slaughter before he officially loses his ""better than the opposition"" status?"
"Assad started the rebellion by slaughtering thousands of civilians. Assad is not ""the lesser of two evils"" and his armies will one day burn for killing so many innocents."
"I'd like to hear which factors go into your estimation that Assad is less dangerous. Simply saying it's so is troubling.

I'd argue that a dictator with a history of terrorist support, continuing capability to manufacture and use CW, past illicit nuclear programs, with ties to Iran and Hezbollah, and armed with newly-minted 'anti-imperialist' and anti-Western credentials poses a not insignificant threat to its neighborhood or even beyond.

With a rebel victory, we would see continuing violence among the factions - the extremists vs FSA - for years, most likely. But *within* Syria's borders (mostly). With the majority (75%) of Syrians being somewhat moderate Sunnis, there would be significant pressure on the Wahhabi/Salafi groups trying to impose an ideology with no history in the region. This situation would likely offer the West an opportunity to isolate the extremists from their arms/funds sources while arming/training the moderate factions. Thus, at incredibly small cost, the West could nudge the conflict towards favorable resolution. Won't be easy, but it's possible. Once the moderates gain a preponderance of power, outside assistance could consolidate that quickly. Later, refugees (majority Sunni) might feel safe enough to return, easing pressures on Syria's neighbors.

There is conjecture here, as in any weighing of the conflict. But there isn't much implausibility here, in my view. The implausible assumption, to me, is assuming Assad will become our BFF when he defeats what his propaganda calls a 'foreign plot'. Victory rarely humbles people - it humbles dictators even less often."
I meant religiously/ethnically.
Don't know why you're being down voted. Your statement is true. Even during the conflict he opinion polls and data we had still suggested he has majority support.
"This is dead on. Dictatorship is inherently fragile... it's so rigid that it can't withstand societal pressures. It does't evolve. Dictatorship, if ever, is only useful in affecting big leaps forward, pulling a society out of traditional inertia and into a new paradigm. 

Your point on stability is one I've made and been convinced by for a while now. The twists of logic required to paint this as 'stability', or to see Assad move back into a stable pariah, are too great for me to overlook. The Assad dynasty may have once been useful in, for example, helping Lebanon break the cycle of sectarian conflict, but that wasn't Bashar. And it won't ever be. So the past, being unattainable now, is moot and we are forced to weigh the pros and cons from where we are today.

I see a rebel victory, as terrible as the accompanying violence will likely be, as the least worst option."
There wasn't a violent war in Egypt...
"Ethnic cleansing of whom, retard? Assad's army is multiethnic and multiconfessional, whereas the rebels are Sunni extremists and exclusionists who kill anyone who isn't like them."
For his efforts on Nuclear Proliferation and international diplomacy. 
He wasn't Bush.
"That is a breath-taking lie. Have you ever read a book? Do you know basic world history? Russian imperial past? Soviet actions in the Caucasus?

Silly questions, I know, but I'm never quite expecting self-righteous and ill-informed garbage masquerading as an argument.

"That's a silly claim. Kerry made an off-hand remark which was immediately contradicted and retracted by his own staff. The Russians quickly picked it off though.

It's not worth it to wage a war, at the expense of tens (hundreds?) of thousands of lives, to keep a slightly better dictator in power.  I just don't get it."

"Of course Assad's forces have not killed every casualty. But by far the majority. He has at his disposal a semi-modern state military with the requisite personnel, expertise, and resource. His enemies are STILL relying on the Kalashnikov and the Soviet-era RPG; yes, tanks and a few artillery pieces have been captured, but the lack of logistics severely limits their effectiveness. More salient than this, though, is that his forces fired the first round, tortured the first prisoner, deployed the first (likely only) chemical agents, and razed the first cities.

As for the reports which abound, it is dependent on where your news comes from. Plus, since the question is not whether or not Assad should go, but whether or not we should back the rebels, it is logical for the media to focus on rebels. Even in the US, the media has generally been critical of the rebels in their role of 'questioning govt policy' (an overcompensation for the Iraq cheer-leading).

But which is more evil depends on your focus. I focus on what this all means for international security. Others may buy Assad's 'anti-imperialist' rhetoric. But Assad has bankrolled and carried out state terrorism. He has amassed the world's largest CW stockpile. He has pursued illicit nuclear programs. He serves as intermediary to Iran, a dictatorial theocracy with a history of dishonesty and bad behavior, and handles weapons for Hezbollah, a group which has attacked Israel several times and violated agreements to disarm or join Lebanon's military. They have the power to hold all of Lebanon hostage to unelected leaders' whims
The rebels have factions which seek to establish a radical state in the ruins of Syria, but others have declared this will never happen. The rebels represent ~75% of Syrians' sect. Syria has no history of radical Islam, and recent reports show the people agitating against ISIS rule. Some rebels have committed atrocities, but they have done nothing on a different level that what Assad has done. Beheadings, mass executions, torture, child soldiers, attacks on civilians. Both sides have done these awful crimes."
"The rebels are owned by the ""Zionists"", but so is Putin.

'Course, the ""Zionists"" are owned by those at the helm of the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy, and themselves are merely pawns."
"So let me follow the logic. Mass demonstrations break out across every major city in February 2011, demanding - not revolution - but REFORM. Internal security forces and the army are mobilized to smash protests, employing live fire and widespread torture. The protests intensify, with some calling for Assad to leave. Violence by regime forces continues rising. Not until JULY do groups begin arming, and even then, they limit actions to defending protests. Regime continues, and some factions begin raiding police HQs and attacking government forces.

We know that after this, it devolves into civil war and foreign fighters see an opportunity and flow in. But you *really* believe that the blame for the war lies at the feet of the first peaceful protesters in February 2011? And you *really* think people will forget that it was almost a year before foreign fighters were seen in Syria in any meaningful number? And, *honestly*, you see everything as the West's fault when - after sitting on the sidelines issuing 'firm condemnations' for more than two years - beginning to fund the moderate opposition? Even today, the US weaponry has not been delivered in the numbers promised; even more devastating to your logic, the US is actively preventing certain weapons from entering Syria.

This is quite literally laughable. You've intentionally misread the conflict and now try to peddle the bullshit here. It might make your binary brain feel good, but no matter how hard you try, reality isn't going to agree with you."

Well ... yea. Have you read the U.S. Constitution? Have you compared it to the contemporary monarchical systems in Europe? The American experiment in freedom and democracy was craaaazy radical.
"Correction.  He's better to Sunnis *who support him* than the Islamists are to minorities.  There have been plenty of reports of people being massacred by pro-Assad forces.  And he's been vocally supportive of his father's brutality.  But apparently it only counts when Islamists do it.

If he steps down, the opposition has stated they will enter peace negotiations, for whatever that's worth.

And we have to consider... how many people have to die for Assad to win?  100k?  200k?  500k?  Wow, he must be really fucking great for that price.  It's like people are willing to throw any number of human lives at the altar for their ideological favorite to win.  And in this case, secular or not, it's not like he's Gandhi or Mandela... he's just some fucking dime-a-dozen dictator."

Their promise of peace is worth very little.  The Islamists have been oppressed by a minority sect for a long time.  They are seeing red for many legitimate reasons.  I can almost promise you a genocide or something close to it if they win. 

> how many people have to die for Assad to win? 100k? 200k? 500k?

I'd say conservatively 500k.  My guess is more than that will die if Assad loses, so if I have to name a crass utilitarian price on what his victory is worth victory, I'd say 500k.  Remember, if Assad loses, this doesn't bring into being an unopposed peaceful Islamist government.  The civil war will continue, and I expect the victims of that war and of the 'peace'  to be very large indeed."

What are you even talking about? That is completely incorrect, it is not the same guy, change your tldr. The man who took the photo, took another photo with a group, and that group was (apparently) in a photo with the boy who was beheaded. It is not clear whether they are all the same men, and it clearly wasn't the same time as they are wearing different clothes and have different beards/hair.

Obviously it is shitty, but worst you can say is that the guy who took the photo, took another photo with the rebels who had previously beheaded a boy. No need to make stuff up."

"This is patently untrue. Very little Islamo-Christian conflict has been about religion. Territorial expansion is not a religious issue. Ottoman expansion into central and eastern Europe was not a religious issue. The religious issues we see today have their roots in the philosophy of Qutb, who lived after World War II. 

Islamism was not practiced until 1979 during the Iranian Revolution. This revolution sent Shockwave's in all directions empowering groups like the Taliban, al-Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah. If you look at terrorist organizations and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the world, it is a post-1980 phenomenon.

"the goal is the establishment of a single caliphate.

"That is not correct either. Daesh wants a caliphate, al-Qaeda attacks to discourage Western interventions, the Taliban commits acts of terror for an Islamist government (though not Caliphate) in Afghanistan, the PKK attacks to keep Turkey away from the Kurds, Hamas to keep Israelis out of the Palestinian territories, Hezbollah to give more power to Shia in Lebanon (and elsewhere), etc. All of these, except the Kurds, have one thing in common: They encourage Islamism.

Under this scenario I think it's likely that millions of Syrian will never return home, fearful of revenge attacks for supporting the wrong side in the civil war. 

So, I presume you consider Basher Al-Assad a terrorist? And the Russians are supporting terrorism?

"the rebels are almost in full fledged attack mode, or will be, soon during Ramadan, Expect the unexpected..mentally/psychologically the people feel abandoned, and now that the people of their own will and blood spent to liberate the country will ignite a flame so strong in their hearts, that will keep them alive throughout these atrocious actions against human basic rights.....Our generation is going to get fucked by the previous generation, as had happened to them and their parents. Those old money families both im alluding to the elite business class in syria, and to those here in the US, there is alot of holding on to too much money for your good. I believe psychologically, you may be susceptible to, by fault of being human, find yourself troubled with what to do with all this wealth all of a sudden. you are a young prince, nothing more. then one day you're crown prince in place of a brother or uncle or whatever the family sees fit, and the next day this boy becomes king and ultimate ruler. so knowledgeable and respected, and revered (technically you better act revere-ing even if you don't want to, they take small traditions very seriously). even though unfortunately they dont know what the fuck is going on in the world. its just some kid who inherited all of the wealth he could possibly spend, and doesn't know what to do with it. I can see how this could be an interesting little psychological experiment, give younger children various powerful items, money jewels etc, once they establish the relationship between the items, you monitor and collect data on how they spend it. i bet you'll see similar results if you could analyze the personal finances of ohhh....** pick a prince,** Waleed Bin Talaal, comes easily to mind, super successful entrepreneur. not in line for succession of the thrown, but highly influential. He's more than milked the teet can produce and he comes back regularly seeking more milk. . Most of the milk in Saudi is drying up. Once there is no more milk, or if you catch my drift, once they run out of God's Gift of more oil than to know what to do with, then.. my dear friends, we well see change. But for this to happen, many generations may come or fall. 

>Now it is up to the rest of the world to help keep them supplied.

The world has been trying to send food and water and medicine, but it is not enough. i have confirmed reports of hospital staff roaming the streets of Damascus asking for anybody with O POSITIVE please go donate. I am O+ i wish i could send my own unit and make sure it gets there. but ill have to figure out what to do with life from here,, one things at a time. They need blood units so drastically, but people 
fear to go donate blood which will be used for hospitalization peruses bc they fear the Syrian 'mukhabarat' or *Intelligence Services* standing literally outside the outpatient door waiting for so an so, taking in by ""armed men"" as this point people who dont know who is who, who is pointing the AK at me, who is the other guy with a pistol and the other guy has a machete, At this point the average person's adrenaline response lets say is x units of strength, when you read end somebody you get an adrenal release X proportional to what happened the human brain is very fragile, but very resilient, an has such a strong will,to maintain life . You woulndt know what i mean unless you have dodged death by a hair, and end up having what is essentially a DMT trip, being secreted by your pineal gland, the minds 'mysterious third eye"" A friend of mine almost wrecked on a bike going pretty fast, he was able to steer clear of somebody running a red at the lassssssssssst possible moment, he swore it was like his reflexes and everything was like super sharpened up and ready to go to war (At least thats how you're natural instinct should be)

 ***blood donation is what will cause such a violent reaction, somebody is treating the wounded, buT OH! ITS A REBEL FIGHTER, NO MEDICINE FOOD OR WATER FOR HIM/HER**** 

since it is in shortage and they need volunteers but none really have the energy or the will or determination to step forth and donate, if you cant donate blood for whatever health reason, just keep the massacred in your hearts and prayers. and thoughts, for those of you who do not follow a particular believe. Please just spread awareness. this is the most thing i can do, im literally out of options. coming to the internet for help was a great idea, i read a lot about whats going on in the world, and we are again, in the age of technology which somebody somewhere through use of this.. internet that runs everything so flawlessly and advances exponentially, i really hope the new government here at home in the US dont dare turn into our lives into a place there you cannot sit and enjoy your burger walking down the street in a downtown of a large city. hah, the magical line that can only be crossed in the direction of hope and progress, not more police involvements in small civil cases, and the weeding out of the bill of rights out of the Constitution. I learned that shit back in highschool for AP GOV, we had to learn all the bills and all the meanings and various contorted views of our political backbone. Now it has come in handy. When you can cite a case, name and date, you can silence that officer until he can retort or find another way to abuse the law to harass you further."
"Or they have split the population in two groups , those that are affiliated with Al-kinda and those with the pro Syria government.

War is ugly , News is nothing more than government propaganda and that's U.S or Syria media."
"> The rebels are not justified in this conflict

Definitely not. I totally agree. But Al-Assad's crackdown and the methods he has employed are even more inexcusable as the actions of the rebels. Two wrongs don't make a right. "
"So in Egypt, Tunisa, Yemen, and Libya they were fighting against an oppressive government.  But in Syria, they're just radicals.  OK.
"
"I'm not siding with either party. My thoughts and concerns are for the innocent people caught in the cross fire as thier homes are shelled and their families murdered.
"
"Life is all about taking sides. I believe the rebels have a right to fight for their freedom, even if it is misguided. "
"No because that would be direct blatant disregard of their life. Of course, wherever they do they left a trail of sadness and misery. They would go to a town, people will approach them to explain whats goin on, the moment they leave, even some videos have shown them taking direct fire,,,, WOOPPPP! helicopters up,, shits hitting the fan, literally dodging RPG left and right. out of ammo, safe only last 3 rounds for when completely worth the shot. get iin range aim first shot, it was a dud. load and fire the second shot, too late! that man gave his life up fighting for his freedom, he was doing what the real meaning of jihad is. Jihad has such a negative connotation, when in reality, it translates simply, Jihad means ""struggle"" literally thats all it means.  God is gracious enough to make it so that if you somehow 'struggle' in defending your self, family, friends, or property and or honor, and you die gallantly, you are considered automatically among those who will be rewarded, so you see many people are suffered so much they are ready to simply die and move on through the next stage. we have yet to bring somebody dead back to life to tel us what its like on the other side, but i have a feeling you either go very slowly and painlessly and in good memories, or your end will be proportional to how good of a person were you, genuinely?"
"If the rebels where not given weapons, then the Syrian governments systematic genocide of everyone who disagrees with them would go unchecked."
"Only if one lives in countries with a vested interest in Syria, or more correctly, their resources. Fortunately for me, I don't."
"Well if the regime is getting funds from Iran and the rebels are getting funds from SA, this is a proxy war... And that means that both sides just fights their puppet masters fight. So when the Assad regime has fallen we will see a Saudi backed perfect sharia state. "
not when both sides are shitty oppressive ones
"Yeah, but now it's just another proxy war between the U.S. and Russia."
"With so many countries in which its respective government systematically genocides everyone who disagrees with them unchecked, why arming the bloodthirsty Syrian rebels has become so much more important than the other countries? if you ever played Risk or other war games, looking at the World map could give you a clue why the west suddenly gives a fuck to genocide."
.....what?
"Not really. Last I heard the government in Syria stands alone, and is losing troops to defection constantly."
"It is not hard to see that some people have interests in Syria's natural resources. However, if that was the only reason, then those people could just have easily thrown their support behind the country's government and achieved the same goal. Thus there must be more to it than just that, perhaps the world has finally learned their lesson with regards to dictators and would rather have the democratic process given a chance. Unfortunately, that cannot be achieved while a dictator still sits on his throne in the country. He should have taken the offer of asylum when it was given, as it is now, he and his family will likely pay the ultimate price."
My understanding is that we're supplying the rebels and Russia is supplying Assad.
"""The world has learned the lesson""? Really? You think weapons are being supplied out of good-will? "
"> My understanding is that we're supplying the rebels and Russia is supplying Assad.

If by we, you mean the Arab Gulf states, yes."
"I am pretty certain that they have stopped supplying him with weapons and armaments. They know as well as the rest of the world that it is only a matter of time before Assad is removed from power. His soldiers and commanders have defecting, and that is usually a sign that things have started to go badly for a side. The Russians are by no means fools, and it is unlikely they will support the losing side of a war. Particularly now that it is not a question of political ideology."
"Hardly, but unfortunately dictators can not be removed by kind words and good-will."
"He is losing military personel but the intelligence network remains largely in tact and supportive of the government. As it was said better, ""the ice is melting but the core of the cube is frozen solid.""

The real spicy narrative is the various groups within Syria and the different intentions of those funding opposition movements. You have everything from democratic peace groups to Al Qaeda.

Russia and China still show tepid support for Assad, but the big picture for them is keeping US interests and influence to a minimum and keeping NATO from blatantly violating international laws and norms. Assad or not, they just prefer that is successor isn't a Washington-Paris-London ass-kisser.

My guess (for whatever it's worth) is that outside actors will continue militarizing their preferred groups in Syria; they'll keep up with the pressure tactics; they'll frantically continue searching for a successor. The government won't roll over and intervention will near. Then the asylum offer will reappear and Assad and his closest advisors will accept it."
But you also believe it is unlikely that the weapons are being supplied out of good-will. So what is the reason you think weapons are being supplied?
"If they do not want the successor to be a US/EU lackey, then it would be wise of them to support the rebels, would it not. That way they will have greater influence of the country after Assad's inevitable fall."
"Obviously, several groups have an interest in the countries various resources (and future market), if these groups have shown their support to the rebels, it is likely that once they have taken control of Syria, they will remember who helped them, which in turn can lead to lucrative deals. As with almost everything, there is always a motive, and the motive is more often than not money and/or resources.

I have no delusions about the motives, but even bad motives can bring good things."
"I guess that depends on how you view the opposition. Personally, the impression I have is that they are not unified. There really isn't a singular opposition movement to throw weight behind. The Russians have probably accepted that Assad will be gone, but they're not going to watch a 'Yemen' get pulled on them so easily."
What makes you think the resulting government made from rebels will be democratic or even better than Assad's?
"Then it would be wise if the people with an interest in Syria, economic or otherwise, find a way to unite most of those rebel groups."
I can do nothing but hope. It can certainly not become worse.
"It can CERTAINLY become worse. So the only thing that makes you think rebels are better than Assad is hope? Perhaps before forming an opinion, you should study both sides. Remember, if politicians want to intervene, first they need support from the population, and mass media is the best way to do that. And it is apparently working."
It is doubtful that it will become worse than it is. Assad is murdering his population for nothing else than induce fear. Pretty much everything is better than that.
"How do you know he is not murdering just the rebels that are trying to overthrow him? And that the rebels will not do the same with Assad's supporters that are a part of the population? And even worse, begin to kill each other to decide who will be the leader, and then throw the whole nation into a chaos that will ultimately destroy and fragment it, turning into multiple rival states that spread blood of each other, like happened in Yugoslavia? It can CERTAINLY be worse than Assad, but you seem too blind to see it."
"Because he is killing children. He is ordering his troops to kill indiscriminately: The old, the young, children and adults. His soldiers are killing babies."
"And so will the rebels, when they start a faction war, in a possibly much worse scale. And please elaborate (with reliable sources) how is he INDISCRIMINATELY killing babies. You should stop the emotional appeal, you sound like a propaganda machine."
"Did you miss the around 200 children killed by his troops last week? It was all over the news. They invaded homes and killed everyone inside, men, women, and children. Including babies."
"And you still did not comment on the behavior of the rebels, who can be far worse, should they start faction war against it other and tear the country apart. Talk to this point instead of talking about killing babies.

Besides, I said INDISCRIMINATELY. Was that region supporting rebels? Remember that when you fight against a insurrection, you have to actually kill citizens supporting (helping) the movement. Now I imagine the last thing the Syrian government wants if they suppress the insurrection is to have a huge problem of orphans or women who cannot sustain themselves (as they will not find work) bringing even more instability to the country in a few decades. And I fail to see the difference between killing a 10 years old male, 20 years old female, 60 years old male. They suffer the same way, and I dislike to see those emotional double-standards.

Again, you should address the main point, which is not babies: what makes you think that after Assad falls, the rebels (who will have to fight to decide who will be the leader, like in Lybia) will not divide the country even more and spread INDISCRIMINATE violence to a even more disturbing level?"
Isn't it already basically an all out civil war? 
"By rebels do you mean those guys who are being equipped with military grade weapons and a shit ton of propaganda? I'm sure the revolution started out with peaceful, righteous intentions but let's not shy away from the fact that it's been hijacked by outside entities who are looking to make war the reality."
"> UN abandoning **Syria's rebels**...

> Bashar al-Assad and **Syrian rebels** flout the UN's ceasefire deal...

That title makes like total sense! Hadn't been happening much ever since I got that lobotomy.
 "
"with china and russia blocking any major action on UN side and russia parked a couple of warships infront of syria as a warning mesure against a libya style campaign in syria, i dont see exactly what else can be done. 

Several anti iranian influence nations like saudi are allready pushing all the weapons and supplies they can sneak in, but with russia and china sitting in a position where they are blocking any intervention, theres little else the international community can do. "
The United Nations is too busy issuing denunciations of Israel to worry about Syria.
"When the peace keepers move out, the war fighters move in.

Russia sending troops and arms to Syria? Shit is about to get real, fast."
"I wonder what will happen if the rebels win. Well, we can look at Egypt or Libya and estimate that Syria will go down that path, except it'll be much much bloodier. 

Assad has been especially hard handed with his people though, as his father was in the past. I am sure they will not forget the atrocities committed by the Assad regime against them. 

And what better way to remember than by committing new atrocities against the Assad regime? If the regime falls, Assad better run to the UAE and hide. Otherwise, he will be executed in an alley somewhere while being filmed by some guys holding a cell camera and screaming ""god is great"" over and over.

I have no dog in this fight, so its quite interesting to watch it go down. Its sad that human beings act this way, but whatevs, they are not my people, and neither side is obviously worse than the other.

"
Wait a moment.  People are criticizing the unarmed monitors for stopping their mission of documenting violence after they themselves were the target of violence?  How does that make any sense?
The UN is aways useless
[deleted]
"Maybe they remembered Syria is a sovereign nation, and, when faced with an insurgency, has every right to deal with the problem as they see fit."
Finally!!! Nobody in Syria wants peace. They want Assad out but he is not willing to just go. What is left? Civil war. Every side seems to have their wealthy allies so I am looking forward to shocking massacres and general chaos for years and years to come.
"Yep pretty is and was lol. Anyways, Russia aren't going to let their shipments and allow involvement. I vote to stay out... tough to have effectiveness."
"Yeah, Isn't civil war the mission? This is pretty much Libya part 2. Stir the pot, then send in a bunch of paid mercenaries immigrants to act as 'rebels', support them with air strikes, then chase Assad out of the country."
I don't think the Sunni terrorists are outside entities. They've always been there. The Arab spring just gave them the perfect chance to strike.
"In addition, the so-called governing authority of the rebels is basically a disjointed council of overseas Syrians who are very much detached from the day to day happenings of the rebellion.  Their leader is currently living in London or something.  The opposition parties all pledge marginal loyalty to the SNC, but how is that really going to hold if Assad gets toppled?  Libya actually had an NTC government that was on the ground with relatively good control over the rebel army, and recent events suggest this government hasn't got a solid grip on power either.  

If Assad goes down, don't expect Syria to change for the better anytime soon.  We hear rebels talking about solidarity, but that goes out the window once there exists a power vacuum with dozens of opposition parties vying to fill that gap.  If these parties really are only united in their opposition to the Assad regime besides some empty platitudes about working together during reconstruction, the ground game for Syrians is going to be very rocky for the next few years, if even."
">theres little else the international community can do.

China and Russia are part of the international community. As is Syria.

What *you* mean is ""The western powers led by the US""."
"And Quebec. Those monsters, they took away protestors' video cameras!"
">he will be executed in an alley somewhere while being filmed by some guys holding a cell camera and screaming ""god is great"" over and over.

Good. He deserves worse."
"Not really. If you understand what the UN was created to accomplish, you will see that it does exactly what it is supposed to do.

The UN was created as a political cover for the global domination of the Allied Nations after WWII. Unfortunately those Allied Nations fell into two camps that were natural enemies.

So the UN makes it possible for those 5 nations, working in concert, to dominate the globe, and it does that job perfectly. What it also does is prevent any of the Allied Nations from dominating any of the other Allied Nations (the veto).

So when you say the UN is useless, that is only because you think the UN was there to ensure democratic global governance, rather than to legitimise undemocratic global hegemony. The former it doesn't do at all. The latter it does perfectly."
Citation? The actual external contributions to the fighting have been Iranian RG fighters on the ground & Russian ordinance. The allegation of support of insurgents by Europe & the US is unsubstantiated.
"You didn't do your political science homework did you? Even Thomas Hobbes, author of the Leviathan and the standard bearer for a totalitarian state which can do whatever it wishes to it's people, agreed that a leader who can no longer provide for the safety of his people is no longer fit to rule. Sovereignty is only justified as long as the state is protecting it's people.

Bashar al Assad is obviously not fit to govern any more, he has lost his country and will not get it back. "
"It scares me to think that if us civilians in the U.S. grabbed our guns and started fighting the government, that another country might want to intervene. What if it was a civilian group I disagreed with? Would I be cool with another country supplying these rebels bombs and rockets?

Truly scary. I guess I don't understand why people want the U.S. to intervene in Syria, and we let countries like North Korea go on with their daily lives. It boggles my mind."
"The US has been involved in covert actions setting off revolution after revolution SINCE 1953 - Guatemala, Iran, Nicaragua, Panama..."

Clark claimed in 2007 that a source in the Pentagon told him in 2001/2002 that the Pentagon had plans to attack 7 countries in 5 years, including Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Iran.

We all know about US actions in regards to Iraq, Iran, Libya and even Syria. But did you ever wonder where this Kony 2012 campaign came from? A couple of freshly graduated students travel to an amazingly dangerous part of the world for first world students, and create a global media campaign calling for military action in Sudan? I smell CIA. Somalia and Lebanon are obvious. Anyone with a brain knows the US has a long history of interfering in those nations.

So how is it that in at least two of the countries General Clark said were part of a plan to attack 7 countries in 5 years, local dissidents just happened, out of the blue, to start armed insurgencies?

You know what they say about coincidences?"
Qatar and Saudi Arabia are not in Europe or the United States. 
When 14 thousand of your people are dead and your country is in civil war you are clearly no longer fit to govern. The rulers responsibility for his peoples safety is his main reason to be. 
"The rebel FSA insurgency was formed in July 2011, the sieges of Daraa and Homs started in May and before that protesters had been shot. Who is protecting who? The government crackdown was initially a response to the peaceful protests, not the insurgency."
"They did no such thing, they admit they held an active role once the intervention started but they weren't ""behind Libya"" as far as starting the rebellion."
Because I'm making fun of conspiracy nuts? Okay. Please go on about how poor misunderstood Assad and Gaddafi were framed by a multinational conspiracy between NATO and the MSM.
they are proxies. 
"In 2007, nearly 13,000 people were intentionally killed with a gun in the US (not including suicides).

In Iraq, the US killed between 250,000 and 1,000,000 civilians.

Who are the US to tell anyone who is ""fit to rule""?"
"They don't explicitly say that, but then again, like I said, they're the Council on Foreign Relations. Practically the CIA/Western World's PR club. They wouldn't say it directly, and an admission like this in their official publication can be interpreted - taking into account the US's history of similar behavior in the region, especially toward oil-rich states - as such."
"My comment to you has nothing to do with the subject being debated. People who make comments like the one you made genuinely ruin subreddits. Just because some people have extreme, far fetched conspiracy theories, does not make all conspiracies extreme and far fetched. You are effectively trying to latch on a bunch of extreme theories to his, instantly discrediting it. This is the worst of the worst and your actions inhibit rational discussion. If you don't agree with what he said, why not refute him instead of pull some immature move like you just did? YOU ARE A CANCER"
Sure they are friends of the US but they also have wills and interests of their own. Do you have proof that the US or EU are arming rebels through Qatar/SA?
"I'm not saying the US is fit to tell anyone, I'm saying I am. The US has a legal system and actively prosecutes anyone who shoots someone else. Syria does not. Those death tolls come mainly from Iraqis killing Iraqis as a result of the civil war following the US invasion, the US did not kill them directly, it was an unintended consequence. "
"I like how first you were all ""THEY ADMITTED IT!"" and then you were all ""WHEN I SAID THEY ADMITTED IT I MEANT THAT I TOOK WHAT THEY SAID TO MEAN THAT THEY WERE INFERRING IT WITHOUT ADMITTING IT!"""
Any proof on AFRICOM running the Libyan revolution then? No?
"> Do you have proof that the US or EU are arming rebels through Qatar/SA?

History. You [guys](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) can't escape it.

Oh, not to mention:

That's what they admit in public. Your propaganda is too obvious."
">The Kurdish YPG militia launched a major assault on Monday to seize the last government-controlled parts of the northeastern Syrian city of Hasaka after calling on pro-government militias to surrender, Kurdish forces and residents said.

>They said Kurdish forces began the offensive after midnight to take the southeastern district of Nashwa, close to where a security compound is located near the governor's office close to the heart of the city.

>The powerful YPG militia had earlier captured Ghwairan, the only major Arab neighborhood still in government hands.

>_______________

>The YPG is at the heart of a U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State militant group in Syria and controls swaths of the north, where Kurdish groups associated with the militia have set up their own government since the Syrian war began in 2011.

>_______________

>The complete loss of Hasaka would be a big blow to President Bashar al-Assad's government and would also dent efforts by Moscow, which had sought through a major military intervention last year to help Damascus regain lost territory and prevent new rebel gains.

>Kurdish forces have expanded their control of the city despite the bombing of several locations by Syrian jets.

Well it says 1.1 it seems pretty new.
I find it hilarious that the Saudis figure themselves better than Assad.
"Apparently Moscow has been losing faith in Assad (much to Iran ire). 

It's only Saudi Arabia that imposes an immediate (military if necessary) overthrow, instead of political transition. 

Just few days ago in Doha US, Russia and Saudi Arabia met in a ""trilateral"" meeting. This Saudi visit is obviously continuation. "
Send Assad to Donetsk as Putin's viceroy.  Problem solvd  /s 
It is an illusion that diplomacy is a driving force here.
"I really don't think the Saudis care about ""better"" or ""worse"".

I think it's more of ""us"" and ""them""."
Sounds good. Do it!
"They'll welcome him. Since that moment beheadings and polygyny will become not just an occasion but a law. And barrel bombs, he'll teach them this awesome thing."
"As a Syrian, shrugging sounds about right. Little the world can do without causing more chaos. So yes, shrugging."
"""Shrugging"". Sure.

This kind of sloppy reporting is part of what prevented a swift resolution to the Syrian conflict in the first place. The media made it seem like this would be swift and easy if only the West intervened. They failed to take into account how high-stakes Syria was for Iran and Russia.  


When the West did intervene, and ran into trouble, no wonder they cut their losses and ran.  


What we would have needed to stop the bloodshed was massive Western military mobilization. That would have required selling the Syrian war to the public, and getting public consent. Only then could we achieve the mobilization needed to stop it. The instinctive interventionists all over the media never explained this, thinking it'd be too hard a sell. Instead, we got the worst of both worlds - neither a full blown invasion, nor a commitment to sticking to a diplomatic solution. This is the result.  


It wasn't shrugging. The West intervened, it lost, and now has lost the appetite for more fighting."
"> West intervenes

""Those damn imperalists, only looking out for their own interests and causing more chaos""

> West doesn't intervene

""They're doing nothing and just shrugging and letting people die!""

Sounds about right

edit: I mean, I'm not strongly in favour of only one side. Intervention is sometimes necessary, but to what degree? That's the biggest problem here. Act too aggressively, and you're an invader serving your own interests (which in some cases turned out to be true anyways). Act too passively because you are unsure or careful and you're criticised for doing nothing. I'm just a guy on the internet, so what do I know of politics. But it seems like a really hard decision on how to act sometimes."
"Yeah. I'm being completely honest when I say, I just dont care.

I mean I care when it gets brought up. But without this post I wouldnt have thought about Syria today.

And be honest, without being actively reminded about it, would you?"
Yep. Can't stop a random guy from shooting people in my own country. What do you expect me to do about a country supported by Russia and Iran killing people on the other side of the planet?
"I do care, but I don’t want the USA to go to war over it.  One of the few things I agree with Trump about is we should largely be non-interventionist right now.  Maybe if we hadn’t gone to war in Iraq and eventually gotten out of Afghanistan I’d be more open to it, but not now."
"""world"" did not consent to this scenario to begin with. Thus, all blame belongs to the creeps who are behind this crime against humanity."
Likely would have been long over by now if foreign powers hadn't meddled?
Intervene and you're an imperialist world police killing more people for oil. Don't intervene and you're a racist for not caring about Arabs. No win scenario.
I honestly don't care.
"Short of full on invasion and intervention, we can't do much. Seriously, you can crticize for not doing anything if you want, but I don't want to instigate world war 3 for Syria. 

Sorry, it's not our problem."
What else can we do? This has gone on forever..
"The fuck does the ""world"" want me to do?"
This shit gets old.  Let 'em kill each other.
But if an olive tree is torn down somewhere it will spawn a 2000-page circlejerk thread on reddit.
"The rebel held areas are basically dominated by extremist jihadist groups that stockpile their weapons among civilians. We've seen how ISIS used human shields and this is no different.

They stockpile weapons amongst civilians so civilians will die in bombings and they'll get this kind of press. It should be as clear as day to anyone with more than two braincells. 

Ultimately they need to surrender."
"Well the last time the West intervened (see country to the East of Syria), it was hystorically claimed as a blunder... So yeah damned if you do damned if you don't."
"Well, the problem is that Syria is a proxy war. All the regional powers like Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel and some other players like Russia have their own priorities and none of them include any sort of peaceful resolution any time soon because none of those powers will draw out of the conflict as long as it's ""only Syrians"" getting killed and they can maintain their influence on the region by keeping the conflict alive.   
  
""The West"" might force a temporary sollution with a massive intervention but then the proxy powers would simply switch targets to Western forces and resume their conflict as soon as the West pulls out again.  
  
As much as I would like to help the people in the region it's a regional problem and as long as there are so many ""bad players"" from the region I don't know how ""The West"" could help."
Just like Yemen
"No sane person wants a proxy war with Russia.  Any military intervention in Syria is just that.

The west has done all it can reasonably do in Syria short of engaging in an all out war with Russia.  It's not going to happen.  We are walking away, and rightly so."
"Since the Middle East's difficulties are enmired in religion, and since religion is something that you can't really shake people from forcibly, but with logic and reason, and since the Middle East doesn't *ever* listen to reason, only two logical endings are possible. 

1. Their religion is true, and all this death means nothing anyway

2. Their religion is not true, yet they still prefer fighting to leaving the religion that causes all the death. 

Each of the outcomes causes me to not care. I can only tell people religion is nonsense for so long before their fate is their own."
"Probably because averaging 10 people a day isn't even that bad for a war lol.  


It's hard to take modern war even that seriously to be honest, when you hear statistics like ""2500 US soldiers dead in Afghanistan war"" I just think ""is that it?"". It's a *war* and in nearly 20 years only 2500 have died? That's nothing. 

&#x200B;

Of all the things to be concerned about in the world, I don't think some minor conflict in some shithole is one of them."
The media sure wants us to invade. Wonder how many BBC reporters will be fighting with us.
Russia and China bear a little more of the burden I think.
When the world doesn't shrug the death tolls tend to be considerably higher.
"People need to die for this god forsaken war to end. It'll burn out eventually and there's not much we can do. Not our turf, it's Russia's vassal."

They are talking about Assad's regime and its supporters, countries like Russia and Iran. They are bombing jihadi's that Turkey is ""backing"" (actually rather using them as a cannon fodder). This mess is between the backers and they are Assad regime, Russia and Iran versus Turkey, Qatar and other factions. Basically Turkey is funding rebel groups that decided to listen to their orders. Assad and Russia are now basically bombing them out of existence and nobody is saying anything, but obviously it's the ""wests"" fault now and we are to blame."

Not sure what you mean by this. Western intervention in Syria is probably at a peak at this time. Or at least peaked under Trump. There wasn't much intervention to speak of under Obama until very late in his presidency. There certainly hasn't been any running."
"How is it sloppy reporting? That's exactly what Michelle Bachelet said. Have you read the article?

> The rising death toll in Idlib had been met with a ""collective shrug"" and the conflict had fallen off the international radar, while the UN Security Council was paralysed, she said. She said the civilian targets were unlikely to have been accidental and warned that those carrying out the attacks could be charged with war crimes.

> ""Intentional attacks against civilians are war crimes, and those who have ordered them or carried them out are criminally responsible for their actions,"" Ms Bachelet said."
"Other than preexisting, ineffective sanctions against Iran, how has the West taken any real steps to stop the funding of the conflict by not only pro-Assad forces but the anti-Assad supporters?

This is an especially relevant question regarding funding that is flowing from the Gulf States.   What exactly has the US done to prevent the funding of questionable anti-Assad forces whose longer-term allegiances and ideologies remain either unknown, ignored or tacitly accepted?

The conflict won't immediately end without funding, but it certainly wouldn't have been as inflamed if funding for both sides of the conflict were restricted.  The West has a stranglehold on not only the world's banking system but also just happens to be the literal safe house (much of which via its high-end real estate market) for much of these Gulf States, Russia and other countries involved ruling class (stolen/corrupt) monies. 

Do you want to end the Syrian conflict in the next year or so?  Simply shut these countries access to the banking system and freeze/seize their foreign asset holdings.

That just might get their attention."
More war? Yea!
">The media made it seem like this would be swift and easy if only the West intervened.

Never bought that the media were pushing for regime change by simply reporting on the horrors of the Syrian conflict. Never have. Never will. That suspicion and paranoia of the mainstream media coverage of Syria has led people down the deluded path of accusing the White Helmets of staging attacks with child actors and chemical weapons attacks being false-flag operations, just because it runs opposite to the mainstream narrative. There's been no 2003 style battle-crying and fear-mongering in way the Western media has reported the Syrian conflict unlike the lead up to the Iraq invasion, mainly because it has happened in a post-Iraq world. Mainstream media reporting has made great leaps since then."
"There was a middle path. Implementing a no-fly zone or militarily punishing the regime through air power would've forced them to take the diplomatic route. Even the threat of US retaliation has made the regime not attack the Kurds in the North and attempt diplomacy instead. If the same was extended to the rebels before they fractured, Syria would've at least became a frozen conflict instead of a hot one where many die everyday."
">When the West did intervene, and ran into trouble, no wonder they cut their losses and ran.

How so? We rolled in and slaughtered ISIS and a bunch of Russian mercenaries. What do you mean by ""cutting their losses and ran""?"

People who want the US to get involved in the United States and people who want the US or really any other ""Western"" to stay out are normally different people who don't do 180s after a country intervenes. For example Code Pink and Neo Cons have their same thoughts on Syria as they did on Iraqi Freedom 16 years ago."
"Intervention was unnecessary.  Assad was no threat to anyone, and the so-called ""peaceful protesters"" turned out to be violent jihadists.

Netanyahu ordered the US to destroy and they faithfully complied like a subservient dog.

Now they're doing the same thing with Iran."
How Americans are constantly trying to act like victims is pretty grating. I see why the world is getting tired of us. How about we just don't sell weapons to terrorists and also don't go to war? Can we do that? Are there only 2 options?
"Screw the idiots in the former category. Screw them to hell. Maybe Saddam Hussein should have been left in power mutilating his own people? Maybe Serbia should have continued killing Kosovo? Should Hitler have had free reign over Europe?

No, no, and no. Yet for 7 years Assad gets to do whatever the hell he wants."

"I can honestly say that I've brought Syria up a small handful of times in the last half decade, without prompting.  This isn't a new issue.  This issue was here before ISIS.  I find it disgraceful that the US hasn't acknowledged it officially.  Trump has put more faux pressure on China than anyone put on Assad, best I can tell from the comfort of my arm-chair.

"The most obvious answer is to vote for people who support measures to stop these injustices. 

But, more importantly, also get others to vote. Tell them any way you can, every day.

Tell everyone you can to vote in 2020 (and again in 2022). That's what we expect you to do."
"Except that's not how it works.

The US (nor China, UK, France, or Russia) doesn't play 'world police' when it decides it should 'intervenes' in a country. Simply doesn't do that in a country that isn't asking them to intervene, and certainly hasn't been doing that in any M.E. war in the past *forever*.

The reason why US/UK/France aren't doing so now is that voters won't stand for it, because they they the above, but voters still wish their government WOULD do something...if they were to do it right. Basically, there's 3 options:

1. Do nothing (The voters don't like that, and the governments are OK with it)
2. Invade and set up a puppet regime (The voters don't like that, and the governments would LOVE to do that)
3. Invade and set up a proper state (The voters WANT that, the governments don't, and the voters don't trust the government to do that)

Russian and Chinese people don't voice their dissent (if not outright worshiping the ground their governments walk on), so those countries basically do whatever they want."

"The west did not intervene in Iraq, it was the US with British support. For everyone else it was only a clear ""damned if you do"" situation. It was obvious that it would throw the region into chaos and has directly created the situation in Syria."
"At least Russia picked a side and committed to it, rather than offering support to a side and then ditching them the moment it became diplomatically inconvenient."
The fact that there are many parties intent on fighting each other and no obvious (or non-obvious) path to peace is another explanation.
Correct. Iran is allied with Syria and was supplying them with oil since Syria is under sanctions and so is Iranian oil. The UK stopped the tanker carrying Iranian oil near Girbralter because the EU prohibits oil sales to the Syrian government. Iran got pissed and retaliated against a British tanker in the Persian Gulf. Iran didn't have any legitimate reason to stop and board the oil tanker.
End the war ISIS has been defeated next up is HTS and peace in Idlib. Remember all the talk of massacres in Aleppo that did not happen.
"1. There are multiple sides.

2. Few of them think they're losing.

3. The likelihood of reprisals (executions, oppressions) in the case of surrender is extremely high. The war definitely isn't just ""over"" when one side loses."
"> Why doesn't the 'losing side' of this Civil War just surrender

Would you trust Assad to have mercy on the people who surrender?"
"What’s left of the opposition hasn’t really lost yet. They still control a big chunk of the north and, just last month, blunted an offensive against their territory pretty successfully. They have no reason to surrender because doing so means going into Assad’s jails and being executed. It’s stalemated, and the opposition is content to experiment with building some kind of state there with Turkey’s backing. 

The only way they could be conquered is if Iran and Russia really committed to it, because the Syrian army on their own can’t do it. Russia and Iran don’t seem particularly interested in that because of the costs, although Russia is fine with being air support."

Hitler was invading multiple sovereign countries and seem like he wanted war with the west (note how you specified 'Europe' when you mentioned his name?). Intervention in that scenario was much more justifiable.

As for the others, last I recall, those countries aren't part of any western countries intervening. Last I recall, America doesn't own Iraq/Serbia/Syria. They're their own countries. So would you like to inform me why I -- as an American -- should support intervention from the USA?

As it is, I only support intervention under three strict criteria: (1) the country's government explicitly asks for intervention, (2) the intervening country votes (through Congress/Parliament/public) to intervention legally, and (3) the intervening country has a clear timeline for intervention and ultimately exit that it must be legally bound to follow.

Otherwise, other countries' problems are their own goddamn problem. I'm not interested in being the world police. If the Syrian people want to save their country, they'll have to do it on their own. If Israel wants war with Iran, let them fight their own goddamn war."
">Maybe Saddam Hussein should have been left in power mutilating his own people?

The USA murdered between 600,000-700,000 totally innocent people in Iraq and, in the process, directly created ISIS, which has gone on to kl countless thousands of innocent people within the country, and thousands more outside of it. 

So yes, it would have definitely been better for the Iraqi people for you to have left Saddam Hussein in place."
"Yeah, but the problem is after the reign. 

After Germany's destruction, other countries made sure that Germany could go back up in the west. As for the East it was a bit left over by the URSS, even worse, another bloody regime was put back. 

Iraq was a complete failure and was a major impact for the creation of ISIS which is also a bloody group. 

Kosovo kinda recovered from that war because there was a bit of investment but it still is one of the poorest countries in Europe. 

As for Syria, if we intervene, we piss off a lot of countries which could lead to an even greater war. If it doesn't escalate much, it's just gonna end up as Egypt 2.0 which isn't great either. Because countries that will destroy Syria during the intervention (any side) will not invest back to put the infrastructures back up. 

Also why don't you take the exemple of Lybia? We also intervened there, yet it's been a whole mess since then."

The only things which have directly impacted the civil war as a result of the Iraqi War was the rise of ISIL after the withdrawal of US troops under Obama, but even then, ISIL only entered the picture back in 2013 and the Syrian rebel forces such as the Free Syrian Army are doing the majority of the fighting."

"Turkey not wanting to bear the blowback of years of its support to militants - moderate and extremist- in the form of additional refugees has been a major impetus. The rebels in Idlib have been shielded not because of their battlefield prowess (they've suffered horrendous casualties judging by what figures they will admit to) but because of larger geopolitical games - the Russians need Turkey to be on board with the S-400 sale and to be at odds with the US, so the offensive is not as aggressive as it could be given the SAA's advantages in men and firepower."

Regardless who we vote for. The real powers players don't get elected. Voting for rep/dem is just a different side of the same damn coin.  Doesn't matter. I have no control of what happens there and my sympathies go to them. But besides that 'shrug' i guess
The Assad regime is the one slaughtering people. The US has generally kept actions in Syria targeted against Al Nusra and ISIS except for the air strikes on the SAA air base following a chemical attack.
But what about all the arms manufacturing shareholders? They have to eat too.
No other answer has any merit. This is why the war has gone on for so long
"Umm, the war was over, Assad was defeated and about to concede some political power to end the war - then Russia and Iran got involved to help Assad kill 300,000 people and make 5 million refugees - then that's when the rebels were outnumbered by the growing tide of Islamists when their cities were bombed with chemical weapons and Russian air mass bombings - the US involvement did practically nothing to alter this theatre of war bar a few old vehicles and some anti-tank weapons. The media has been basically reporting the Russian/Iran disinformation narrative ever since. Once the West had dealt with ISIS in the East, the real war continues as ever, the civil war with Russia and Iran providing the mass murder machines."
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the people downvoting you probably aren't informed enough to even know about the Al Nustra Front.
"But, Hezbollah and Iran are our 'real' enemies."
"How would sanctioning Russia prevent the Syrian government from conducting air strikes? 

Iran supports the Syrian government too, and is currently under sanctions. Have those anti-Iranian sanctions prevented the Syrian government from conducting air strikes? Or was [Assad just in Tehran a few months ago hanging out with Khamenei](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-assad/assad-meets-khamenei-in-first-iran-visit-since-syrian-war-began-idUSKCN1QE24G)?

"There was absolutely no guarantee of what would happen to Germany or Europe before the US and UK got involved. The situation was that an evil monster was mass slaughtering people and he had to be stopped. Humanity did not allow these countries to shrug and turn a blind eye.

These are specific understandings that if violations against human rights become so severe, drastic action must be taken. Countries agreed and signed these commitments. 

And so why aren't they acting? Because so called antiwar dogma has sweeped through the West and politicians are too afraid of their base to fulfil their international obligations.

Even when Assad was at his lowest point, he wasn’t close to being defeated and he wasn’t about to conceded.  He was willing to concede some political power when he was losing but the talks went nowhere because the FSA didn’t have a single leader to actually speak for them, nor could they agree to anything.


I wouldn’t say Russian involvement was more effective than American involvement - their proxies fought to a standstill and actually American backed rebels made lots of gains early on.

The problem was the extremists took over leadership of the rebels, and then half of them went off to form ISIS, and America had to refocus to fight ISIS."
"500 million dollars (public support package by Obama to train rebels, probably more than a billion in secret costs), embedded special forces in Syria, direct air support for Kurds and Iraqi troops, Cruise missile strikes as retaliation and scare tactics, lowered aggression from russians on rebel targets by force projection. The US is the only reason the rebels held for 5 years. (Source: extended family lives in Aleppo.)

"The Iraq Body Count website (which only lists deaths that are publicly reported and verifiable) has the death count at 288,000 - but since this figure is restricted to deaths which have been officially recorded in the press is regarded as a low estimate and way below the true figure.

The peer-reviewed medical journal the Lancet did two studies in 2004 and 2006 which put the death toll at 600,000 and in 2007 the ORB research company put the figure at just over 1million dead civilians. The Iraqi Death Estimator project in 2011 combined the information from Iraq Body Count and then applied the same methodology the Lancet used in 2004 to reach a figure of 1.45million civilians killed by the US armed forces, although of course that doesn't take into account the death toll of ISIS or the US-led coalition in more recent history - the bombing campaign in Mosul 2016-17 for example is estimated to have killed tens of thousands of civilians.

>People that come into the country to specifically to kill other people are not innocents.

"The western support for the Syrian opposition overall was very small (if we dont count that for the Kurds, which was more directed against ISIS). There was way more from Turkey, SA, Oman. And even more from Iran and Russia for the other side. And the western attacks on ISIS also helped Assad.

For you to reduce the opposition to the human rights abuses and war crimes happening in Syria along with the global ramifications the conflict has created as whole, to be only beneficial to the US and it so-called plans for global hegemony, I find to be very ignorant of you.

Various other nations have intervened in some capacity or another to counter Assad's wholesale slaughter of his own people. Many of those same nations, with the United States at the lead, fought an entirely separate war against a fiercely aggressive and parasitic terrorist organisation that exported its own unique brand of evil terrorism and Islamist ideology globally (and also committed a **genocide!!!**). Now that the dust has settled on that front, Trump wants to withdraw all US troops and wants his European partners to step-up and fill those boots. Does that sound like US hegemony to you?"

They already have. Remember when the European powers toppled the Ottoman Empire?
"The US didn’t get pushed back. We destroyed ISIS and left. That was our stated mission. When we did engage Russian mercenaries, they got utterly destroyed.

The lowest estimate that is taken seriously is the Iraq Body Count - that's just all the deaths that have been publicly available in papers and websites and stuff, and that is nearly 300,000. The consensus (and the one with the strongest evidence to back it up - even the British Ministry of defence doesn't dispute it http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6495753.stm ) is the Lancet study, which is a peer-reviewed academic journal of the highest possible standard, used to publish the results of medical tests and public health crises and so on. They said 650,000 is the most likely figure back in 2004-6 and of course it's going to be even higher today, probably approaching a million even by these conservative estimates.

>but many many people crossed the border in order to kill coalition forces

Coalition forces (90% of which were American) had no business being in someone else's country, they crossed the border and killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. I assumed this is what you were referring too.

It was entirely within the rights of Iraqi people to resist the American-led invasion of their country with violence. International Law and basic common sense says as much as that. They were innocent. The overwhelming majority of those killed were non-combatant civilians, but those who weren't were fully entitled to use violence to resist US invasion under international law and the terms of the Geneva Convention."

"That's a good question. I mean that with complete sincerity. Corporate news tells some version of the truth, just not one that's uncorrupted by bias. You can get stories from them but either have to start doing your own research into what they're saying to find out the reality of things, or find somewhere that seems to do this. Personally I'm a fan of Jimmy Dore. He's a night club comedian that got sick of the horrible biases of FOX, MSNBC, CNN, etc, and started doing his own youtube show. He's moderately entertaining to watch, does get a little too.. mn... aggressive at times for my taste? but ultimately he's got a great way of breaking down stories to show what the crux of the issues are and why the corporate news is presenting a story the way that they do. The guy isn't Jon Stewart, he's not trying to be, but if you're looking for a comedian to present issues in JS style, this isn't the guy, just to put that disclaimer out there. 

The guy either has a good memory or has people that work with him that do because they pull up a lot of points from things that happened in the past that show why X corporate news is presenting Y story in the light they are, because of Z past event that they're still trying to push but rewording it or presenting it in a different manner. 

The big point is that you can't just get your news from corporate sources alone anymore, or if you do, just make sure you're getting them from different corporate sources and not just the same source rehashed for different versions of the same slanted tale. 

Jimmy Dore was also the first place I personally learned of the 1970's Church Committee, where US representatives started getting concerned that the FBI and CIA were planting agents in media outlets. They formed the Committee, named after one of the representatives that founded it, and discovered that every single major, and a scary amount of minor, news publication in the US had a government agent working in it to be able to control the propaganda that we, the US, put out. 

That was in the 70s. It wasn't until the last decade that we had a president that officially repealed the bill that made it illegal for news outlets to publish propaganda on US soil for the US citizens."

We kept funding them anyhow, but it became clear that they were a worse option than Assad and that sort of stopped. In other words, the West tried to go the ""moderate rebels"" route, but the rebels stopped being moderate. Short of very early invasion to back some random defecting general for leader, I'm unclear what people think should have been done to find a moderate faction."

Russia is trying to expand their influence into Britain. It's not trying to avoid ""ceding"" influence in Britain to America.

There's a difference between advancing and not retreating/withdrawing.

People from warzones will however be ""tolerated individuals"", they can stay until the situation in their home nation is considered safe.

Another from your links:

> Since they appeared defensive in nature, Thursday’s strikes did not suggest a shift in the U.S. military’s focus in Syria, which has been on battling Islamic State militants.

> U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said America’s role in Syria’s conflict was unchanged.

The Syrian government was never the target under the current administration. If we wanted Assad out he’d be laying in a crater.

You’re conflating instances of American defensive action with an intent to overthrow the current Syrian government. 

If France flew a jet into an American no-fly zone we’d shoot it down. That doesn’t mean we are going to war with France.

You don’t call up the forces you are supposedly at war with and tell them where your forces are and to avoid that area if they want to live. Which is exactly what we did in those instances with both the Syrian and Russian governments.

When Trump destroyed that Syrian airfield, it was to send a clear message to Assad that if he continued down the path he was on that regime change would be put on the table.m

Or do you really think that the most powerful military the world has ever seen went into Syria, shot down a handful of Syrian jets then tucked tail and ran away while sustaining almost no casualties?"
"The 600,000 figure comes from the Lancet, which is a peer-reviewed medical journal of the highest calibre, and as you can see from the link it's methodology has been confirmed by the military as being robust and correct.

If anything it's a low estimate cos it stops at 2006 - we've had an extra 13 years of carnage to add on to it. But it's the consensus best figure available.

Of course, the apologists and defenders of mass murder on this scale will always try and quibble over figures, just like holocaust deniers do, but those of us who base our political views on evidence and not knee-jerk boneheaded nationalism know this is untrue."
">In fact, only about 20k civilians were killed by coalition forces.

Astonishingly glib use of the word ""only"" in this sentence."
"Yes you are. You can't use your political and economic power to muscle in on other countries sovereignty and claim that's fine, then whinge when Russia does 1/10th of what you do.

For example I'm a Labour party supporter, and in the 1970's the CIA under the leadership of James Angleton tried to foster and support a military coup to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing government, mainly out of petty revenge because we refused to send troops to Vietnam.

Neither Russia or the Soviet Union have done anything quite so unforgivable to my country's democracy as that single incident - one of many in the CIA's gruesome history."

"But see I will guarantee you that YOU do not know 100% whether or not Assad used chemical weapons. Only your confirmation bias. 

WE do not need a WMD II."
"I think that sort of misses the mark. The US in particular is quite happy to keep backing people even if defeat is far more inevitable than it was here. Both out of stubborn belligerence and because the US gains to some extent by simply forcing Russia to expend more resources. I'd also note that even without Western support, Assad has still not retaken the whole of Syria (and actually appears somewhat stalled out in Idlib). 

The domestic tone however was very important. ""Moderate rebels"" quickly became a jeer. Beheadings by the rebels and the fact that guns were going to even Al Qaeda affiliates were not popular. That's despite the fact that there was quite broadspread Western support for fighting ISIS in the same country."
How is the origination of the Syrian empire even relevant to the outside world stopping the current government from committing war crimes?

I hope so.  It's very tiring to have to keep reading about tribalism in the Middle East.  Why can't people grow up?  How can they be stuck in literalist religions and tribalism in 2010?  They are fearful and pathetic people.  They hate thinking.  It's only obvious.  In Greece Socrates advanced free critical thought and gladly paid for it with his life.  In the Middle East everyone is a coward who is afraid to get hanged or stoned by the imams and mullas!  I say they should all gladly march toward death in order to uphold free and critical thinking.  Their lives are worthless.  They are like plants without water.  They are not living.  They are withering.  Do they realize it?"
">What would that look like? Maybe one filled with corruption? 

No.  A democracy is a rule by consent (simplified).  If a bunch of dicks come together and civilly consent to a common rule, that's what evil democracy is like.  So for example, a bunch of people can come together and democratically agree and consent to a law that says ""anyone who offends Islam must die.""  Such a law can easily be enacted through a democratic process.  That would be an evil democracy.

Democracy makes sure that the government is not too far away from the culture it represents.  If the culture that participates in a democracy is an evil one, then all their consensual, participatory democratic laws and governance will be evil.  Such laws and governance will simply be representative of the dominant culture.

And yet I still maintain that a democracy is always preferable, regardless of the underlying culture.  Why is that?  Because people deserve to truly sample the fruits of their beliefs.  Evil people deserve to live in an evil society and democracy accomplishes this.  At the same time, good people don't deserve to live in an evil society and again a democracy accomplishes this.

In a dictatorship situation it's possible for evil people to live in a society that's better than they deserve.  And it's also possible for good people to live in a society that's worse than they deserve."

I see your point before about how you'd prefer that (and that's your option etc.) but I think if you say something like that you cast aspersions on the people of the Middle East as a whole.

Everyone is brainwashed.  Greeks were brainwashed in Socrates time too.

The point is this: yes, environmental influence is important, but it's not everything.  50% of responsibility goes to the internal human factors, inside the person.  50% goes to the external environmental factors, outside the person.  Both work together to produce the result.  While you can argue for unfavorable externals, the internals are always free.  There is always opportunity.  The heroes of thought are always welcome to leave their mark in all circumstances, with or without consent, with or without support, thanks to or despite the environment.

So instead of seeing them all as victims, we have to split our opinion 50/50:  they are somewhat victim and they are also somewhat guilty and responsible for their own predicament.  That's how I see it.  I acknowledge all factors and not just some.

>They are hardly educated to even a 10th grade level of science and thus easily fooled.

This was the case in many countries.  Even not so long ago it was the case in Russia and even more recently in China.  And yet Russia is relatively better off.  Lenin was fighting huge battles to improve literacy in Russia, it was a huge problem.  The point is that every country had all the same difficulties.  Middle East can't bitch about being uniquely disadvantaged.  They are just whiny stupid bitches.  Others rose to challenge while Muslims sit on their ass and smack their foreheads.  We need to hold them fucking responsible and stop cutting them so much slack.  Every country had tough times and had to eat humble pie.  Every single one.

>I got news for you buddy; you're no different from them.

I admit the same.  But we are lucky enough to not have fallen in the same trap so let us fucking **say something!!**  Instead of going ""awwww poor guys.... poor pathetic guys"" crack the whip a little and tell them to get their shit in order.  We have to combine compassion with honest criticism.  These fools need a mirror because they naval gaze 100% of the time thanks to their idiotic tribal lifestyles.  Naval gazing can actually be illuminating and useful, but not when it's the exclusive and sole activity!  Sometimes you have to look out and see what else is going on.  These Middle Eastern retards need to try to understand that there are hundreds or thousands of religions out there and that they are perhaps equally or perhaps even more right than Islam.  Or perhaps no religion is right at all.  They really need to start thinking in this way.  Really think about issues.  What makes life actually better?  Why?  Stop parroting imams.  Stop supporting personality cults.  Grow up.

You better quote something when you make this kind of charge.

>We'll fuck them over a thousand times and erase them off the map if necessary. Stop trying to threaten us, bitches.

The point is not that I want to nuke anyone.  The point is that we must put an end to the politics of threats.  I am not looking forward to nuking anyone.  In fact I want peace.  I want tolerance.  Islam is a radical and intolerant doctrine that's making peace very difficult.  While I prefer peace, I am not Ghandi.  If some countries begin screwing around, I have no problems supporting retaliation up to the level of their screwing around.  Maximal screwing around means maximal retaliation.  The emphasis here is not on the retaliation, but on the fact that I don't bow to threats.

So the whole flavor of that post, if you take it all in at once, is that I am not afraid of threats.  When dictators say, ""If you remove me, chaos will ensue"" I say ""Fine!  Let chaos ensue....  GET LOST!""  So I am saying to dictators to get lost no matter what the consequence is.  I am also saying I am prepared for any and all consequences, including nuclear war and the destruction of this very planet.  Nothing scares me.

Get it now?"

First, I don't really want to nuke any country.  My actual doctrine toward ignorant countries is to practice control and containment.  Just limit the damage the ignorant ones can cause outside their own country.  Basically make the countries of ignorant fools to be like zoo cages.  Let them live as they wish inside their cage.  If they want to evolve and learn, we can let them out of the cage.  If they continue to be ignorant, let them remain and let them not carry their diseased mind around the world.  So basically let them live but don't let them spread out.  We can even trade with them, just that we have to be careful not to give them toys they can't yet handle.

That's one.

Two.  They are partially responsible for the situation they find themselves in.  You can't blame 100% of their predicament on the West.  You can only put partial blame on the West.  It takes two to tango.  So as a member of the West I accept **partial** responsibility for the fucked up state the Middle Eastern retards find themselves in.  Now, are they going to accept their own huge part of the responsibility?  Or are they going to keep pointing fingers outward?  It's time to stop pointing fingers outward and to look in the mirror.  Yes USA has been meddling.  But no, the USA is not in total control of all affairs and USA is not the total and complete determinant of what happens in other countries.  These fools need to start taking at least some responsibility and stop their bitching.  Like, immediately."

No trains, no nothing...our entire economy depends of cheap readily available oil and NOTHING ELSE WILL WORK. Our Govt. and the GOP has places our nation in serious jeopardy by NOT dealing with industry in a way that promotes both economic development and a weaning off of cheap overseas oil that simply will not flow forever.

INDEPENDENT of Israel's actions towards Lebanon, Syria has taken part in a ongoing and long term destabilization of Lebanon. It is not mild, it is even part of the reason for both the last wars. They kill leading christian politicians and fund military groups outside the democratically elected government in Lebanon. They fund and help arm groups that keep killing both lebanese and israelis. How is any of this _mild_..? Is what Israel does _mild_ because russia and us does far worse thing? If we were to apply your logic, what israel does to palestine and lebanon is barely noticeable because of the wars in different regions in Africa.

">I'm neither a zealot, a zionist or hold the opinions of Israel you think I do.. :)

A true test of whether you are a zealot or not is whether you are able to acknowledge that israel has killed thousands of lebanese and destroyed billions of dollars worth of property and that this was disruptive to lebanon.

Unless you are ready to acknowledge that israel has been much more disruptive to lebanon with their actual killing of thousands of lebanese, routine invasions, and wanton destruction of property I have no choice but to conclude you are a zealot.

"[This is a stupid fucking move for both of them, this is what the area looks like Hasakah is in the far east where ISIS holds most of the surrounding area's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities_and_towns_during_the_Syrian_Civil_War)

They were both on the defense with government and Kurds defending against ISIS and now ISIS is putting pressure on the area and the Kurds and the government fall out with each other, worst timing ever really. If ISIS does break Kobane they will most likely move resources to the bigger Kurd contingent in the east. The government is also winning the war against the FSA they have the FSA encircled everywhere and if the FSA falls they will most likely slaughter ISIS since ISIS manpower wise is the weakest out of everyone the government hasn't even bother to do any real offensive on ISIS yet either rather focus on the bigger FSA threat. 

Also the Kurds don't have any real friends in the area Turkey is obviously not supporting them at all, unless the YPG is banking on Iraqi Kurds crossing the border without caring and helping which i doubt to be honest cause that would mean hostility with Iran which i doubt Iraqi Kurds want. All in all strategically a very opportunistic move and at the same time a terrible move. 

Also this map makes it look more cleaner then the civil war really is imagine this then add in the militias, armed citizenry, criminals, opportunists, Islamic front, Al-Nusra, Hezbollah, Shiite brigades obviously linked with Iran, SRCC, JAD, MAA, Al-abbas etc etc etc, the list literally keeps on going. It's a fucking mess but a good mess for the government since most of these stronger groups are loyal to the government. "
It's dangerous to trust Assad.
"Oh, like they weren’t having enough trouble against those other guys."
"Isis will never break Kobane, the american bombers defend it, the kurds aren't alone cause they've received military support and training by the Eu, Assad was the one to make a stupid move by breaking the truce by the way he doesn't need another enemy, especially one who is supported by human right activists from all the world and since august Isis has doubled his syrian territory."
"That's great and all but in reality ISIS could break Kobane, they have already taken over the entire surrounding area's. It's a war of attrition cutting off Kobane from the east is just as good for ISIS as taking Kobane, Kurds being stuck in Kobane means less pressure in the east, this gives ISIS freedom to do what it wants in the east and surprise surprise they have been moving in on the Kurds in the east. 

The YPG wasting manpower fighting Assad is dumb, Assad has the aerial advantage and the political advantage. 

I get nationalism and wanting the Kurds to win since they are the better group but in reality that doesn't win wars and even winning a war does not mean you win the war, anybody smart enough who can look at a geopolitical situation can realize that."
"Kobane it's a trap for the Is cause they keep on losing manpower and heavy weaponry under the airstrikes just to avoid a pr defeat, they keep on losing a lot of ground there even cause Erdogan allow the Ypg forces to reach the city from its border with turkey.If Ankara discover that the kurds could become a valid allied to defeat Assad it will not think twice about supporting them. Actually is Assad that have done a dumb move to risk to wast more manpower against the Ypg, his war against the Is is going bad."
"Just look at the fucking map and the facts all you have to do is Google Syrian war Wikipedia is honestly the best up to date source man, your talking about magic the Kurds won't stand a chance against the government lol, not alone they simply cannot. The only big Kurd contingent is the east and it is getting moved on. The remaining one in the west is blocked off by ISIS, The FSA and the Government. The government has the aerial, political and manpower advantage as of now.

The FSA might ally with the Kurds but they will turn on them eventually. The Kurds agenda does not fall in line with any of these bigger group's as the Kurds mostly just want Independence.

Turkey will never support the YPG that is a ridiculous statement they are actively hostile lol, please do some research on the area. "

America is withdrawing from Syria after the defeat of ISIS. But because we fear a regenerative spawn of ISIS, we need *some* presence to contain the threat. So, in lieu of our troops, America asked Germany to deploy theirs, effectively replacing ours. Germany said no and that is likely to incur anger among officials in Washington.

Basically, America and Germany - two NATO members - are fighting over who doesn't have to ""occupy"" a country. No one wants the job of militarily policing foreign nations. How does that square with your view that America (and the West) is eager to invade and colonize every place possible?"

I don't believe it possible that the Syrian Kurds are ever going to get what they want, for that Assad is too strong. However them being strong currently is one of the better bets for stability in the region and having NATO forces just physically being there, especially in the regions in which the TFSA and Turkey are active, helps their position a lot.

Germany has no obligations in Syria, arguably not even moral ones however just pure self interest might work just as well.

Is the reason good enough? We can argue about that until the cows come home and there are arguments for and against that.

">Why more troops? 

You answered your own question:

They don't want to improve lives, they want more terrorists. More terrorists means they have to stay longer, staying longer creates more terrorists which means they have to stay longer etc etc.

Syrian war started under Obama. Exactly what do you disagree of the actions Trump took since he got into office?
"Dude, you sound like a brainwashed psycho. Don't fall for propaganda so easily."
"To fair though the whole war escalated, because we as Europeans failed to act sooner. This is our backyard and we let the whole thing escalate to a point where there was no return for the current Syrian regime and they asked the Russians for help. Assad knows the west very well and was in favor of reforms, but he had a weak position among his people. We could have strengthend him, but neither the EU countries, nor the US was willing to really help.

The US did only send their troops to be a counterweight to the Russians and to have a say when that whole thing ends.

Because we were cowards and didn't act we have lost a potential partner that was willing to reform his country in our direction and we have a shitload of new Russian ports and air bases on our southern flank.

In my opinion this is much more our fault than the one of the US. In particular we Germans feared to use our power and it would have been very much justified to use it. The former US ambassador to Germany John Kornblum once said something like that the EUs soft power is worth nothing without the US hard power and that's exactly what we saw here. The US under Obama was not willing to act alone and the time for talking was just over."
"I don't deny that Trump is an idiot, but there are a few things you got wrong.

First of all the whole thing started when Assad bombed his own people. When the situation became dangerous for him he fled to Russia from where he kept on bombing his people with the help of his dear friend Putin.

The reason ISIS was able to get a foothold and the whole situation escalating in an all out war is because of Assad and Putin. Only then the USA got involved and rightfully so.

Putin and Assad are both monsters and the USA (for once) did a good thing by getting involved. They fucked up plenty in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. but what they did in Syria was mostly justified. Personally if it weren't for Trump's behavior I'd be all for us sending in additional troops."
"Lol 🤦‍♂️ read the title, dude."
"Our military might not be in the best condition, but it would be not a big problem to deploy a few hundred troops there. It not that they asked for a whole division to be deployed. 

The problem is rather that there is absolutely nothing to gain for us. Syria is lost no matter what. The US and not we did a deal to protect the Kurds, we just said we deliver them weapons and we kept our side of the deal.

The US wants out now because they know there is not much to win there and they won't have a say in what comes when the whole mess is over.

The thing is though that the US will try to keep boots on the ground on an absolute minimum in future conflicts in the near and middle east. That means that they will need local militias as their boots on the ground. If they leave the Kurds now to the mercy of the Turks, the IS, Russians and the Syrians no group in the further future will trust them anymore. Maybe they'll try just try the Russians next time...

This is all about the new US doctrine and their reputation for the future."
"Germany has currently ~ 3,300 soldiers deployed.

"I guess i'd identify as an anti-imperialist. Lets see if I can explain

>But because we fear a regenerative spawn of ISIS, we need some presence to contain the threat.

I would say this is the thought process that imperialism is made of. You invade a country, cause a bunch of problems, then say ""oh well we can't just leave, the problems will get worse if we just leave"" and so the soldiers stay permanently. Then hey maybe theres a ""problem"" in a neighboring country and weve already got troops stationed next door. ""We can't just let this happen while we could stop it!"" and so we invade another country and start the process over. Eventually you are the American Empire with military bases at every corner of earth and the flimsy pretexts for war are rolling in daily.

>How does that square with your view that America (and the West) is eager to invade and colonize every place possible?

I see this as the US attempting to get its allies to do the dirty work of a long occupation. The US occupied Afghanistan and Iraq for a long ass time and it was expensive and fruitless. Iraq is now an Iranian ally and Afghanistan is on the brink of being reconquered by the Taliban.

And so Trump wants someone else to go through that BS in Syria, but unfortunately I think we are seeing the final days of the American Empire since our allies, whos support allowed us to stay on top, are now distrusting America and wondering where their new place in the world is.

So this honestly doesn't change my perspective much at all. I never thought trump was a bloodthirsty warmonger anyway, just a fool who might stumble into war while trying to act tough. So hes acting tough by saying we need soliders in Syria, and hes a fool because he thinks our allies will do his dirty work."
"It isn't Germany's place to clean up your mess.  
My view that America is eager to invade other countries is informed from well used American habit of invading other countries."
"It's called a ""power vacuum"" and no, ISIS isn't done yet. Mark my words. Trump wants to say it is, cause it's during his regime, but it isn't. The war still rages on and stability is far from happening."

America should've stayed right there and solve the problem itself created. This is the second time America leaves a political vacuum, turned out really well the first time."

Oh no, how scary."
">No one wants the job of militarily policing foreign nations. How does that square with your view that America (and the West) is eager to invade and colonize every place possible?

They don't care about colonizing anymore, just invasion and oil mainly.

The hardest part to imagine is the US not being at constant war.
"Two?  More like 8,  Read Michael Hudson, I think in the book, Killing the Host.  He was a Ph.D. economist working for Wall Street at one of the top 5 accounting firms in the US during the Vietnam War.  He was tasked to analyze the US balance of payments (trade deficit).  His report found that the US had no balance of payments deficit in the private sector of the US economy.  The entire US trade deficit was caused by the Vietnam and Korean wars.  That wrecked the US and World monetary system.  The US Defence Dept told the accounting firm that if they published the report the company would never get another US government contract.  Basically, the Cold War was a fraud designed to enrich insider oligarchs.   It has along with the other wars wrecked the American manufacturing center and corrupted US and World banking.  They keep starting new wars like a sick gambler, because they're like diseased gamblers that keep thinking they'll get a winning dice roll.  When I hear how we blame it on Russia or Iran or whatever, it  basically makes me want to vomit."
I legit think we all would have had flying cars by now

"Stupid question. The correct question would be ""How did America turn protests for better living conditions into devastating civil wars?"""
"They didn't but they certainly stopped what could have been a repeat of the Hama massacre (short, extremely bloody war, followed by peaceful Syria) by supplying the rebels with TOW's, which completely obliterated the Syrian army's armored capabilities, putting the rebels on an equal playing field (see 2012 Battle of Damascus or Canopus Star for what was happening before this), and helping stage the war as we know it."

You speak of stability when it's an outright war out there.
"Why? Syria was a comparatively secular and advanced country before the civil war and the refugees that make it to Germany are usually well-educated middle class, and both willing and capable to integrate. That is exactly the kind of immigrants we want and need!"

Nah, you just [meddled in their elections](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-admits-funding-syrian-opposition-1.987112) and shipped literally [thousands of tons of weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_Sycamore) into a country that already suffered from social unrests bordering on civil war, due to a drought to which [the US denied aid participation](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08DAMASCUS847_a.html).  


But when Russia buys a couple of Facebook ads they steal whole US American presidential elections and installed their own dictator who now controls everything the US does.

But the Jihadist extremist elements were already a big part of the original uprising, as [they've always been in Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamist_uprising_in_Syria). Which makes it all the more cynical that the US kept supplying training, money, and weapons to these groups while insisting they could guarantee those weapons will only go to the most moderate of ""moderate rebels"". Because active war zones are known to be very awesome situations to enact firearm ownership regulations."
"i see you guys started to rewrite history allready

Our taxes subsidize the military industrial complex, so how in the world would the economy be worse if we weren’t subsidizing it? We could have forgiven all student debt and put that money right back into the economy, and we still would have had trillions left over. We could have invested in education and infrastructure. We could have invested in our people and our country, instead of investing in war because it’s “good for the economy”. But because of people like you, we didn’t. Do you know how macro and micro economics work?"
"The military industrial complex creates no values, no assets, no sources of income. It is pure consumption."

"I must’ve forgotten that France, Russia and The United Kingdom became States in the last few years..."
This is the sort of ignorance that breeds when people actually swallow the bot propaganda.
"Blaming the Syrian Civil War on the US and the US only is quite a bit short sighted. The Syrian Civil War sparked out of the Arab Spring against the violent dictatorship of Assad. Is it fair to give the US some blame for Daesh because of the instability that the Iraq war caused and gave a fertile breeding ground for it? Sure, I can accept that. 

I also agree that the US should do it's part managing the fallout of their actions but that isn't really the issue because what the US should do is one thing, the rest of the world can only deal with what the US does do. No matter what happened or should have happened, we today are in the situation we are and we can't turn back the clock no matter how much we want and as it stands today, with the US administration at it is, countries like Germany should take interest in what is happening in Syria. 

The US could fuck off out of the Syria or the whole middle east tomorrow and sit save and sound with a whole ocean between them and the mess they created and enjoy a quite weekend with a burger in their hand. Europe shouldn't have to ""clean up the mess"" the US potentially created but fact is someone has to and I'll say that it's better to act instead of putting your hope in the US doing it right because their track record just isn't the best."
They’re fleeing Assad.
"The Civil War is basically over, so is Daesh. Today most of Syria is in relative peace and stability. Active fighting happens around the Idlib pocket which doesn't concern the SDF/YPG and the western regions between SDF territory and the TSFA / Turkey. Of course there are still regular issues with Daesh cells and the prison camps are an ongoing issue but Syria is mostly in the state of rebuilding, not war anymore."
"Refugee unemployment is still around [40%](https://tcf.org/content/report/germanys-syrian-refugee-integration-experiment/) but that isn't really the point. I mean you are probably not going to tell me that it's a good thing that they had to leave their life and home behind, fleeing war and terror, traveling miles and miles just so Germany can a few more laborers? I think we can agree that it's better if refugees don't have to be refugees to begin with, no matter how good integration might work. If Germany needs the workforce, opening up channels for normal immigration probably is a lot better than hoping for another mass refugee crises in the middle east. 

Not to mention that it did cost a lot and I'm not even talking about money, I'm talking about political capital. As direct result of the refugee crises the populist right gained a lot of momentum, Germany heavily damaged it's reputation with eastern Europe and Erdogan did use the Syrian refugees in his country (who are now facing increased hostility and violence in Turkey)[ as leverage by promising to let them all into Europe when the EU doesn't agree to visa free travel.](https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/erdogan-says-turkey-parliament-will-block-eu-refugee-deal-if-no-visa-free-travel/)  

I get where you are coming from but even if we assume that everything surrounding integration of Syrian refugees would work without any issues, there are huge political and humanitarian costs associated with it and it's I think in every ones interest but especially Europe's that no one has to go through that again."

Germany were asking Trump to not withdraw troops from Syria. If it's worth something to the German state then maybe it should step up. Otherwise the US has little remaining interests in Syria and wants to leave. Also suggesting that Syria was started by the US is Russian propaganda.
"Can you enlighten me some more with your fantastical facts? USA started the civil war in Syria? Really? 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War

Can you show me how the USA started this? Because wikipedia and the rest of the world think it was part of the Arab Spring uprisings that in Syria people protested to get Assad out. Sparking the Civil War.

So, how exactly did the USA start this? lol."
You cant even compare what obama did with what trump is trying to do. They are completely different groups of people. Thats like blaming the president of germany after ww2 for what hitler did.
"> This is just absurd, nothing like that ever happened. If that's really  your understanding of the situation in Syria, then you've been severely  misinformed, I'd dare to say brainwashed.   

Weird, because Assad bombing civilians has been reported by pretty much all media outlets out there. What exactly is your ""information"" based on, huh? 

>The US was already pumping [thousands of tons of weapons into the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_Sycamore)  a long time before ISIS became a large problem, mostly by crossing over  from Iraq, you know: The place the US supposedly crusaded free of  terrorists.

Oh, I see. It's based on assumptions ...

>But the Jihadist extremist elements were already a big part of the original uprising, as [they've always been in Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamist_uprising_in_Syria).  Which makes it all the more cynical that the US kept supplying  training, money, and weapons to these groups while insisting they could  guarantee those weapons will only go to the most moderate of ""moderate  rebels"". Because active war zones are known to be very awesome  situations to enact firearm ownership regulations.

..and on an wikipedia article that references a time period of almost 20 years ago.

You guys are fucking crazy. I'm out. One more reason to keep away from r/worldnews I guess."
"What the fuck? Assad fucking bombed his own people with the help of Putin and the USA are the ""real baddies""? Why do you think the USA went to Syria to begin with? 

How can you people be so ridiculously uninformed and yet act like know-it-alls?

Again, I do agree that the USA has made a lot of mistakes in Iraq and Afghanistan (and a bunch of other conflicts before that), but deployment in Syria was purely to help the Syrian people and no matter what you **believe** they did."
Provide sources or STFU.
"If you're interested in the whole topic I can very recommend the channel of the US Army war college on YouTube. I stumbled upon them when I did a bit of research on Clausewitz.

One of their best lectures regarding the Syria conflict is from a guy that worked in the coordination team with Russia that kept the US and Russia from bombing each other.

I did really learned a lot about geopolitics from these lectures. Much more than from most news outlets. There are often people talking that have actually first hand experience with the things they talk about and are not just journalists that have just read about it like the rest of us."
2017. You could have linked the recent numbers. And your point is ...?
"> Are you unaware of the condition of Germany military readiness?

who the fuck cares?"
"Interpretations are not your thing, I get that, I didn't expect it, as I said, trumpeteer logic doesn't make much sense to the rest of the world."
"Yes. Invading Iraq was the first mistake, disbanding the Iraqi military with no plan was the second, and breaking the Iranian nuclear agreement thus alienating them and Russia further was the third."
The fact that you think it acceptable to assassinate other world leaders is one of the reasons everyone hate America.
"The fact that you even recognize that ""you"" are ready to invade ""three countries, tops"" makes me fucking sick."
You've built a really great strawman to argue with!
"You’re an idiot. An idiot with a country full of nukes, but still an idiot."
Jesus.
"So in other words, America just made another Saddam.

Good job?"
"Excuse me while I advocate the Devil.

One could argue that America is the reason SDF is able to hold such large territory and that American withdrawal could open them up to rebellious reprisals from the indigenous indignant at their rulers. If SDF moves away from those areas they cannot control and reinforces the areas they can retain, that would leave these vacated areas vacant in power - neither SAA nor SDF rule.

ISIS could then, potentially, slowly creep back up within those places."
And a better education system
Those lobbyists will just wind up having accidents on the way to work.
"Who do you think earned billions in government contracts to rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq.

They quickly learned how much money was to be made in Afghanistan, that's why they desperately wanted another war. A few million in donations to the Republicansto get a new war and a few hundred million in government contracts to rebuild and build new infrastructure is a good deal for a company."
Construction companies are busy dominating state and local governments.
"As someone who works a bit in the construction industry, no fucking way. These guys are more cutthroat and greedy than you can imagine. They'd bleed the coffers dry just as quickly and it's a huge fucking old boys club, making sure the big dogs and their sons win all the fat contracts while gleefully screwing over the no name little guy trying to carve out a couple crumbs for himself."
It is amazing that military industrial complex was warned by President Eisenhower all the way back in 1950s or whenever he stepped down and yet here it is 2019. Warning goes unheeded.
Nope. Just more billionaires.
Imagine being this delusional. Trump trying to maneuver away from war and conflict. Holy cow

It's best to stick with what's true when you want to be against something you don't like. In no universe is what you just said true.
"lol, and you believed him.

hes a republican, lies and war are part of their diet.

democrats arent any better, but i believe Sanders over Trump any day of the week when he states that the US is done with endless wars."
"If you still dont get it - politicians tend to promise a lot of things before polls and does a lot of things differently after polls.

Also it still doesnt change that America generates a lot of money selling weapons of war. And they need a lot of money to maintain their bloated defence industry."
"Then for goodness sake, please stop electing them...

Sincerely, the rest of the world"
No objections over there.
"Somebody just pointed out how your government has been consistently acting in the very same way.  


To that, you replied: ""But *now* it does not represent the people any longer!""  


What difference is that supposed to make? Do you think people getting droned feel or even care about the popularity ratings of US presidents?"
Jeeze. America doesn’t need to be the “villain” to have done horrible shit. Don’t shut down legitimate criticism by saying people are trying to make America the villain. MAYBE some people just want us to be accountable once in a blue moon.

Context matters, and maybe you should stick to your original claim, which was this:

Which is just utter bollocks because that never happened, Syrian government forcers where never pushed as far back as to force Assad to flee to Russia.

The fact that you don't seem to grasp the relevance is kinda amazing. 20 years ago isn't ""ancient times ago"" it's very recent and the purpose was to show you that Syria has had to deal with Islamist uprisings in the past, thus their [very prominent participation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9857846/Syria-how-jihadist-group-Jabhat-al-Nusra-is-taking-over-Syrias-revolution.html) in this civil war, which heavily contradicts the narrative peddled by the US of an uprising that's supposedly entirely ""secular and moderate"".

"Well, some may view this as stealing but generally, when army units defect they tend to take their equipment and training with them.

"I didn't forget it, it just wasn't relevant for the discussion at hand. The current situation in Syria is by no means a good one. That's why I mentioned in one of the posts somewhere in this chain is that I don't think that the Kurds are ever going to get what they want and that Assad is probably not going away so they have to find a way to get to an agreement with him and with Assad sitting fairly pretty at the moment, they don't have much leverage left.

The current oil crises and people just running out of gas is a huge issue but also something that isn't unexpected. We can talk about if Assad is the literal devil that he gets painted as or not day in day out, one might argue that his actions were to some degree dictated by the situation he found himself in. It's however also hard to argue that he's a good guy, conducting the civil war in a humane way. That's the kinda stuff that leads to sanctions, sanctions lead to your Iranian oil delivery (which Iran now claims wasn't even destined to Syria) getting seized. 

I think the only outcome of the Civil War will and can be that Syria gets reunified and under somewhat central control which in all indication will be Assad. Which isn't a good thing but the only realistic outcome that I see today.

Now I have heard arguments being made that the pro-US coalition will only talk in earnest to solve the issue at hand if the US leave and they have pressure from Turkey and the TFSA. That argument might hold some water but it's probably also not ideal for anyone involved. 

With the situation on hand today in Syria, as complicated and tragic as it is, I still think that a strong North-East Syria is in the best interest of the west and probably the best way to prevent a human tragedy. 

I can't claim to have an answer that will fix all the issues. In a perfect world all parties involved would come together, talk it out and find common ground. In a perfect world all forces from Assad and Russia to the US and the SDF would work together to get rid of the last remaining terrorist cells around in Syria and deal with the HTS in Idlib in a civilized way. That's just not gonna happen, as sad as that might be."
"How bout you tiger, where in Syria do you live?"
">no reason to go to a war

Going to war with whom exactly? The only two forces the US is currently at war with is Daesh who are decimated to small insurgency cells and recently they struck against HTS and the Al-Qaeda network in Idlib which still seems to be a one off. If Germany or anyone else would go into Syria in a supporting roll to the US that would compose primarily in a) training the local forces and b) giving support against Daesh insurgency forces. 

If you think the Kurds, who want the support of the west, are better off fending for themselves against Erdogan sponsored TFSA, the murderous dictator that is Assad backed by Russian fighter-bombers and helicopters that is fine. Questionable but I accept your opinion. 

As for your second point, you seem under the false assumption that gaining momentum is the same as taking over. Of course Germany is mostly pro-European and doesn't have an issue with migrants - that doesn't stop the AfD from sitting at some 14% nation wide, 19% in Brandenburg and 25% in Saxony. The later they thankfully fucked up because of incompetency in registering their members for the vote which most likely will result in them getting far fewer seats than they would have gotten. Also notable is the move to the right from the CDU/CSU in reaction to the AfD to reclaim voters.

>Far-right parties gained considerable support in many
European countries in the wake of the European refugee crisis in 2014 and 2015. These parties appeal to
fears and anti-immigrant sentiments in the native population. The strong positive correlation between the
number of arriving refugees and support for far-right
parties over time suggests a positive effect of the refugee crisis on support for far-right parties. Refugee
migration may impact support for far-right parties on
the one hand through factors that only vary over time,
but little over smaller geographical areas (macro-level).
General fiscal concerns or the salience of the refugee
situation in media outlets are examples of this type of
factors. On the other hand, it may work through exposure that occurs if refugees are located in geographical
proximity to voters (micro-level).

"You link articles but you don't understand them. Most of these problems stem from the fact that equipment not used in military interventions is somewhat neglected by the Bundeswehr and therefore not in a state of high readiness.

The German military wouldn't need 100 Leopards or any submarines in a possible limited ground intervention in Syria as imagined by the US special envoy. The Bundeswehr routinely does missions like that in countries around the World like Afghanistan, Mali, and even Iraq."
"Yeah. The current state of the German military isn’t a secret or surprising anyone. Far from that. Our MoDefense is glued into super costly ridiculous scandals and I‘m more surprised the MoFinance didn’t send an army of bailiffs to impound the fuck out of the actual army. Typical result of decades of conservative political rule. The best recent news: Our MoD becomes the new surprise President of the EU commission. 
Poor satire comedians! Our politicians are stealing their jobs!

Your issue is Trump: His hate for Germany isn‘t much of a new surprise and he‘s just mocking us. This request for German ground troops in Syria isn’t real. Trump wasn’t actually expecting any reactions from Germany. He is in fact just talking to his electorate. He re-election is due."
"The invasion of Iraq was not 30 years ago. The presence of ISIS and other Sunni militants, as well as the state of their equipment, is largely thanks to the American intervention in Iraq. It is also damn near impossible to negotiate with Syria and it's allies (Russia and Iran) because they don't trust the United States to fulfill their promises."
"Where did ISIS come from? Who armed the rebels, just enough to cause trouble, and more importantly, who had to deal with the fallout? I saw the future maga hatters complain about the fall of Western civilization and rambling about white women endlessly after their own government engineered a refugee crisis, that Europe and particularly Germany had to handle."

"They wouldn't be broke. They would have less money than they do now, but they'd probably have a very similar standard of living, since all that infrastructure and education benefits EVERYONE'S standard of living. All they did was hurt others, not benefit themselves."

They had to say that back then as the [Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 wasn't fully passed yet](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/), which was legally banning them from approaching domestic audiences with their propaganda, the easiest solution to that was to just cut out the English language.  


But in case people have forgotten: The NSA also wasn't supposed to large scale surveil on a US domestic level, how much of a fuck did they give about that particular rule? Right, exactly zero were given.  


Anyway, since the [Modernization Act came in effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice):   


>**dissemination of foreign propaganda to domestic audiences is expressly allowed over the internet including social media networks**. Isaac R. Porche, a researcher at the RAND corporation, claims it would not be easy to exclude US audiences when dealing with internet communications. 

  
It's also kinda cute how you think the USG would wait with such activities until it has a specially tailored software for them, when they apparently can't even be arsed to [mask their own IP](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015/comments/4ylml3/reddit_has_removed_their_blog_post_identifying/) to at least somewhat hide their activities.  


I guess you honestly think the US military is above such simply applications of ""troll farms"" as these kinds of tactics are supposedly only reserved to evil rogue states like Russia or China, just like assassinating ""enemies of the state"" is an exclusively ""[evil guy thing](https://archive.org/details/cia-assassination-manual)"".  


>I'll tell you who did spread propaganda though, other than RT and the regime, there was Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The fact that we share the same language with them has allowed those states' narratives to dominate. 

Sure they did, after all the US likes to coordinate those activities with regional allies to amplify its effects. Which is also the reason why [anti-Shia sentiments were stoked](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06DAMASCUS5399_a.html) to prevent Iranian influence from creeping up, but at the same time these very same sentiments also fueled Sunni extremist movements like ISIS.  


That's why imho it's extremely dishonest to frame this as some kind of fight between two monolithic parties with ""Secular democratic Syrians"" exclusively on one side and ""evil dictator supporters"" on the other side. That kind of black&white thinking might work for Star Wars movies, but it's hardly an apt interpretation for events happening in actual reality."

"From your very own source:

>Political   observers,   the   media,   and   politicians   themselves have speculated that the refugee situation helped to fuel support for the far-right. The refugee sit-uation may have affected voting for the far-right based on  concerns  driven  by  macro-level  exposure  (e.g.,  the  salience  of  the  refugee  situation  in  (social)  media  and  political  rhetoric)  and  micro-level  exposure  (e.g.,  per-sonal    interactions    with    and    observation  of  refugees).  Both  levels   of   exposure   may   have   influenced    voting    decisions.    However,   this   is   not   clear   at   either level, nor do the effects necessarily  need  to  go  in  the  same   direction.    
>  
>(...)  
>  
>My analysis for the state of Upper Austria suggests a positive overall effect of refugee migration on support for  the  far-right  Freedom  Party  in  2015.  Macro-level  exposure  seems  to  be  the  primary  mechanism.  Direct  exposure  to  refugees  in  border  municipalities  without  interactions seems to further increase support for the Freedom   Party.   However,   hosting   of   refugees   in   a   municipality combined with efforts to facilitate inter-action  between  locals  and  refugees  has  the  opposite  effect; and the resulting micro-exposure reduces sup-port for the Freedom Party. 

Your own source says that immigration can both increase or decrease support for far-right parties, and that where it increases the support, this is mostly due to how the issue is framed in the public disourse, while actual interaction with refugees decreases support for the far right. 

The logical conclusion here is that we need more exposure to refugees, but that would contradict the perverted narrative people like you try to spin, where you try to justify your irrational hatred against foreigners by pointing at the irrational hatred of your like-minded."

"> Syrian civil war was not our fault. calling this one ""America's mess"" is bullshit because pres bashar was fucking this shit up and still is, with or without us.

Yeah the US had absolutely nothing to do with it, the rebels magically came up with thousands of US made TOW anti tank weapons which kept them in war for so long. Somehow the US also just manages to find a reason to keep sitting on the Tanf border crossing which cuts the main highway between Baghdad and Damascus which is totally for anti ISIS operations and not to put up an economic blockade as a last ditch effort to do the regime changey thingy."
"The actual sequence was that a brand new coalition was put together in 1990 amidst high hopes of a new world order as it was the first post Soviet international action

The international forces acting under a clear UN mandate were to liberate Kuwait, which they did, and this involved going into Iraq. They never went to Baghdad though

In the aftermath George H Bush encouraged the marsh arabs in the south, and the Kurds in the north to rise up in popular rebellion against Saddam Hussein; ""no one will shed a tear"". For about 2 or 3 weeks Saddam's fate hung in the balance but he slowly succeeded in re-establishing control


This led to retribution and a humanitarian crisis as the persecuted fled. NATO responded by creating no fly zones which allowed fledgling groups like Ansar-al-Islam to begin getting a toe-hold in Iraq. Previously Saddam had been able to quash these groups as he recognised the threat that popular Islam posed to him. 


In the cities other radical Islamist groups (or conservative if we're honest about it, they aren't really radical) started to appear, notably those led by Sadr (father of the cleric who would come to prominence later). These were also suppressed 


The bottom line here is that the dictators of the region were the west's first line of defence against the spread of Islamic influence. The west however succeeded in removing many of them, including their contemporaries in North Africa too (whilst sucking up to the corrupt oil shiekdoms) 


The west over-estimated the allure of democracy. Basically these countries had very little tradition or institutions capable of growing a democracy in the shadow of turbulence. Ironically, one that might is Iran, but that's a different story


When you collapse a societal structure and ordered way of live in places, you create a vacuum. With little to fill that vacuum people turn to the pillars of stability. In a lot of cases that means the military or the clerics. The military is closely woven to the defeated government's in a lot of cases though, particularly in places like Egypt or Syria. Their fates are inter-twined. 


It's of little surprise therefore that the disenfranchised and frightened might fall back on their religion to fill that void


Yes it's complex, but it's also quite straight-forward too. Sometimes you have to navigate to the least worst, bad option"

"The issue with that is that the US doesn't see homeland destruction. They don't have maintenance costs after a war because it's always on foreign soil.

&#x200B;

I mean, the last damage they endured were Japanese fire balloons in the '40s, and those took like 10 civilian casualties max, as well as some bits of forest. Those occurences were immediately and succesfully hushed by secret services as to minimise their effects on morale, so the story only spread much later.

Hell, even the dramatized Pearl Harbor was thousands of kilometers from the Westcoast and involved solely a military base. Apparently 68 civilians died during the attack as well, including first-responding fire fighters, but still, pretty far from 'home'."

 Syrian soldiers who defected to join the Free Syrian Army are seen among demonstrators during a protest against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Idlib.

 So far the international community has been unable to agree on even the most basic of international intervention - and that's frustrating many Syrians.

 ""Leading Syrian opposition figures have called for the U.S., E.U., Turkey and others to think seriously about establishing a safe zone,"" Hamid said.

 Obeida Nahas, a member of the Syrian National Council who is meeting with the United Nations, is arguing not necessarily for military intervention, but for international recognition of Syrians' democratic aspirations.

 Nahas said the Syrian people have been remarkable patient as the world has adjusted to their power and longevity.

 The Syrian people have been calling for that all along, Nahas said.

"We did it, Patrick!  We saved the city!"
Strong argument for not getting involved in the first place. One or more destroyed nation is almost always the result of warfare.
"""Every time the United States 'saves' a country, it leaves it turned into a madhouse or a cemetery"". -- Eduardo Galeano"
"One of the best sources for this info here : [LeMonde](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2019/02/15/un-colonel-francais-risque-des-sanctions-pour-avoir-critique-la-strategie-de-la-coalition-en-syrie_5424183_3210.html)

Unsurprisingly, this US government's willingness to withdraw rapidly led them to more intensive bombing to end it quickly and avoid sending troops. The price is a lot more destruction (bridges, hospitals..)."
The assumption here is that involving more ground forces would solve the problem. Wasn’t the solution in Iraq or Afghanistan. Why do would one expect 1000 troops in Syria to do the trick?
The Syrian government pretty much destroyed Aleppo without any Western help.
How many times do we have to set chunks of the middle east on fire until they choose to be stable(and give us control over all their oil and oil pipelines)?!
"The upvoters on this stuff can always say they would've risked their own lives to avoid some collateral damage, but I will always be skeptical.

These ""boo western military"" sentiments are always light on reasoned analysis and mired in contradictions. It's bad to get involved, it's bad to not get involved, it's bad to stay, it's bad to leave. We got involved because of oil, we didn't get involved because we're heartless and we don't value their lives, we left because we're selfish and it'll fall apart without us, we stayed because we're colonizers and we're oppressing the population and oh look a bomb hit that thing over there.

Not that there is never any truth in any of these sentiments, but they're applied so formulaically. I vote for actually staying out of everything, so at least when the same criticisms are rolled out we save some lives and money."
"This was the **artillery officer** saying *we are using too much artillery here*. Artillery certainly will kill the enemy. It is what it is designed to do. To shred, tear and pummel enemy and it's infrastructure to oblivion. Problem is this wasn't total war against military installation. This was liberation task in the middle of friendly civilians. Whose home you just rendered to rubble and killed their innocent friends, since artillery shells aren't precision weapons.

&#x200B;

No matter how exact it is the sheer explosive amounts used main it targets essentially a city block. 155mm field artillery HE has kill radius of 50 meters aka 100 meter diameter. aka no matter how good the aiming the smallest precision achievable is 100meter kill circle. That isn't a single person precision weapon. It is a city block leveler. It was never designed to be used in civilian inhabited area. Either you are out in open or you really really really want to bombard the city full of only enemies to stone age. The impact forces and HE amounts used will collapse apartment blocks and just blow smaller houses to pieces.

&#x200B;

Again: This is the **artillery** saying *please don't use us to kill the civilians.* and they know exactly what is fired, where and with what effect. The forward observers would be watching each and every barrage landing and see the destruction.

&#x200B;

Also given the seniority of person in guestions and reluctance of the military officers to speak publicly: Pretty sure his consciousness couldn't take it any more and went *F the military career, I'm speaking out. Bombing civilian cities to ground wasn't what I signed up for or what soldiers under me signed up for.*

&#x200B;

These are weapons of total war. To use them in limited intervention in civilian populated area is extremely ill conceived and immoral.

&#x200B;

All to minimize own losses. The command leadership are literally trading civilian deaths for saving their own soldiers lives. Rifle man can choose not to shoot a civilian, artillery officer can't. If there is civilians in the city, they will die should the enemy be chosen to be killed by artillery. HE doesn't have friend or foe detectors."
"He's arguing that western nations should have invaded syria with troops to put down ISIS rather than rely on bombing.

I think a lot of people are ignoring that and just reading the title"
We? Wasn't western intervention in Syria extremely limited?
If we build them new roads and sewers and hospitals and schools and train tracks and airports then they probably won’t be so mad. But we won’t and so they will be. 
"An exhausted man with a narrow overview shoots his mouth off. 

The reality is that Assad has won, with Russian backing, and he will sit there, much weakened and unable to rebuild for lack of capital inflows. Western influence is now much diminished, and the key to the country's future is how well Russia and Turkey get along. "
">Mr Legrier's article has embarrassed French authorities just hours before the coalition is expected to announce the defeat of the hardline group.

>""A punishment is being considered,"" French army spokesman Patrick Steiger said in a text message.

>The article was removed from the review's website on Saturday.

I think this part got lost in the conversation because most people didn't read the article"
Does anyone really think that the people making the decisions are too stupid to realize this?  
Yeah no shit. The problem is we know what the problem is and how to solve it but we are just too greedy to actually change.
Help them rebuild the infrastructure and we won't have that problem.
"So you're telling me..bombing Afghanistan,Iraq(multiple times), Syria and Libya..doesn't make them like us? But the opposite? God I hate the Canadian government what a bunch of trolls. So powerless. I dont know how many emails and letters I've sent to the MPs and MPPs. So powerless, Did it for Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria. Fuck this. No wonder they fucking hate us. "

"We need constant conflict in the middle east so that the oil companies who run the western world can continue to keep the caste system in place the way it is, continue to get rich, and continue to keep the 3rd world in the 3rd world for cheap labor.

Its been going on since the 30s why would they stop."
"That is exactly what is happening. While Assad is an awful human being, is what we're doing any better? Indiscriminate drone strikes, the bombardment of whole cities, starvation, etc. On top of that we really have no idea who we're supporting on the Liberation front. There are a multitude of groups vying for power within the groups fighting Assad. 

Unfortunately this is a fucked up situation with no real remedy. The best solution for the U.S and NATO powers was to just not intervene. The situation in Syria is getting murkier by the day. There are a multitude of national powers all looking to stake their claim. We've got Russia, Israel, NATO, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey(NATO yes, but they deserve a special mention due to the supporting of unsavory activities), and now even CHINA has been spotted in Syria. 

It is very easy to say ""we're done with it"" and just walk away. As a person not privy to top secret info, I think it is impossible to have an informed view of this clusterfuck in Syria. This is no longer about ""removing a tyrant"", but moreso a staging ground for the world powers. I do know one thing, it must be something big if countries such as France, and Germany want to remain committed to the region. I also am of the opinion that Mattis didn't quit just because of his stated reason (abandoning our allies, reneging on our word, etc). I think something bigger is and much more sinister is behind Mattis raging over Trumps decision to withdraw. 

Mattis likes to look at things from every angle. An example of this is the Iran nuclear deal. His question to the Obama admin was; do we have any contingency plans if Iran uses their newly found finances to influence/fund bad actors in the region? The Obama admin didn't have an answer. He kept driving questions like these home, and he made enemies. Iran begun to do exactly what Mattis feared that they would do, and we had no real plan in place if this did happen. It was also not a stipulation in the nuclear deal. I fear that the scenario I just laid down is much worse than the Iran situation.  "
So basically the only war to win these wars are to add more boots on the ground. Got it.

"Let’s not forget the war in syria’s wasn’t at first about ISIS, it was literally asad vs whatever coalition labelled as Free Syrian this or that funded by US/West... The main damage was done when these “liberators” encouraged and supported a civil war for at least 3/4 years!

"Mmmm ookay.  I think everyone needs to realize that the people that care about any of that are not making decisions.

Should be pretty obvious by now."
I'm pretty sure the Syrian government leveling entire cities is what lead to ISIS taking hold in the country. 
It's almost like that is the plan. To make less stable. To weaken.
"Yeah, I’m sure Bashar al-Assad and Putin didn’t destroy any infrastructure... just the West.  SMH"
America's pull out game is lacking.
The irony is that the west acts all outraged when bombs explode in Paris and London but has no idea what their governments are doing in the Mid-East.
"but you used weapons? your governments paid private sector for weapons

its a win win for your government and private sector. thats why war happens. thats the reason. profit for rich people. make no mistake

Local factions did a great job of tearing the place up before western forces ever got there.
"Sounds like a propaganda post. thenational .ae? Really? 
  
How did we destroy their infrastructure? Syria and Russia have been carpet bombing and gassing every major city. Last I checked, Russia and Syria aren't the US? Don't blame us. Place blame where blame is due. On Syria and Russia. 
"
"And you know, even though we screwed up their lives forever, we don't want any refugees in ourrrrr country. "
"There is a perfect example of what rebuilding infrastructure after a war can lead to: Europe. Rebuilded by the US.  
Well, the western part. The eastern part entered just another occupation without much of rebuilding.  
  
And yet our politicians now only are about death and destruction, not building a future."
let assad have syria and they will develop or not
He didn't get the memo that we are leaving Syria
"Perhaps, dividing up the Ottoman Empire wasn’t the greatest thing to do. Perhaps the world would have been different if Brittan and France hadn’t taken middle eastern territories. I wonder if knowing what they know now, they would have pushed for peace with only the ottomans during the First World War. "
"Why does it seem like after WW2 the majority of countries became working countries again, but every conflict since is just never ending?  I kind of think part of it is we are at war with factions within countries, the concept of war on terror, instead of the countries themselves. But it seems like we remembered the fucking stuff up part of war, but not the rebuilding and moving on part."
If there's money into going to war you would think that we could still use the same shady politics to win contracts and funnel money into our ploy of then rebuilding the country and then making more money for the big players involved? That'd be a huge win for some people who profit off of war right? Make money destroying the country and then make money rebuilding it from the ground up. Why isn't the latter a thing and just the former?
Better late than ever?
No fucking shit.
How convenient.  
"What as an alliance are we supposed to do? There is a terrorist threat in the middle east, our national security is dependent on mitigation of threats domestic and foreign, the occupation of countries who hold a deep fundamentalist Islamic heritage is far from over. Extremely sad. "

"We m it get as well just have the EU or UN take over the territory the next time we ""liberate the people"" for about 20 years to properly set up a stable government. The leaders should be chosen by either the UN or EU to prevent radical leaders. Theres no point in fighting a fight, only fixing 1/3 of the problems and then leaving, only to return 5 years later because of some other radical group."
Might be time to occupy the area and help rebuild it.
"It's like a foreign country supporting and giving arms to the yellow vest protestors and then some terrorists get their hands on it and cause more chaos,you can say it wasnt our intention but you clusterf'@ked the situation anyways.

Same goes with syria,it was an internal conflict with people against the Assad government.Alot of foreign countries supported the so called 'moderate rebels' and we have proof that some of these rebels handed weapons to ISIS. So now we are fighting 2 enemies(ISIS,Syria) at once,even though Syria didnt ask for help defeating ISIS.And while we are at it,why not spice things up and LIBERATE Kurdish people.

Now Syria has to deal with Moderate rebels,ISIS,Kurds,Israel(bombing checkpoints and bases of Syrian army),Turkey,and ofcourse also deal with the accidental bombing by US army or UK forces.
"
"So, mission accomplished?"
In America we call that “liberating”
Did no one read the article? 
I know it's a massive undertaking but one of our top priorities when this is all over needs to be repairing everything over there.

Can someone explain what that means?  Is this maybe a bad translation? "
Watch Charlie Wilson’s war. 
So business as usual
No this is what the want. The resurgence will give rise to more reasons to drop bombs. 
"I agree with this.  We never fully committed to the war.  We did just enough to force a stalemate for years, which increased civilian deaths and destroyed entire cities.  To make matters worse, as long as Assad holds onto power, there will be no help from the west to rebuild the country."
"Since the turn of the century, I doubt that any of the war the West (read US) engaged in, is for the benefit of the country or even moral/ethic reasons.

It's to feed the war machine and pump money."
That's about true for every conflict throughout history.
"So ... mission accomplished, right?"
As usual.
Pull out and never go back. Let the oil companies and Israel do thir own dirty work.
So what should be done about Isis? 
"Many of the ""liberated"" cities and villages are little more than piles of rubble.  Welcome back, populace!  Enjoy your freedom, good luck rebuilding, feeding yourselves and your families, restarting businesses, having destroyed infrastructure!   And by the way, say Thank You and be Grateful!"

"I've often pondered that if the US actually wanted a peaceful planet, that the military should be replaced by massive organization that helped build and develop infrastructure, while working with the new local government. They shouldn't actually be involved until the fighting us over. If they were involved during the  perhaps during unrest, they should be involved to try and help broker peace, with the reward of helping to launch the rebuilding process."

I thought the destruction in Syria was mostly the result of civil war caused by ISIS.
The imperialist history of the fucking west goes on.
"I love how everyone is taking this as the guy saying we shouldn’t have intervened. He thinks the army should’ve sent in ground troops. THAT was the problem for him.

It’s the unwillingness to see Westerners die to defeat ISIS, but still wanting ISIS defeated, that leads to aerial bombing campaigns that inevitably destroy infrastructure that the terrorists hide behind (as well as kill civilians).

People want their government to do something to stop the terrorists, but then complain when they use the methods the people want that aren’t nearly as effective long-term. Welcome to military strategy’s oldest problem for democracies."
"READ. THE. ARTICLE.

How the fuck do you assholes form massive opinions on a title and quote alone? This is why political and news subs are garbage. The colonel was critical that the battle of Hajin was won through autonomous and aerial means rather than with troops on the ground. His point was that why bother have an army if you're not going to use it and that the method that was substituted for it may have caused more damage to the surrounding infrastructure and civilian population while taking significantly longer than just sending troops in. This is a thought provoking point about the value of the lives of the army fighting and the level of devastation they would wrought compared to a much safer method for that same army at the potential cost of surrounding damage and the value of the lives of the people living there. He gave his OPINION of how that battle should have been fought and already plenty of comments here took it as pure fact even though it was a what if scenario. Hell more than half of the comments aren't even about this at all, just more general disgruntled mumbling about *the war* in a vague general sense or with topics not even related to this article."

The destruction in that area was wrought by ISIL, and liberated by Kurds with the support of arabs, minority ethnicities, and the French/American army training. We have not left a vacuum in place.

Do we have to support the men who put forth serious effort to a false cause.  France in Syria is wrong.  To kill a French soldier is the right thing to do if you are a Syrian.  At least the French are telling the truth.
"It may be bad, but it could be worse. Assad would win. He will regain complete control of Syria. Maybe Kurds will achieve some autonomy. Maybe not. But it is better Assad, Hussein and Kadaffi than 'moderate rebels' and ISIS"

I'd pick the first one and so would you.  Not for any political point scoring agenda. But just cause I want to live, and my kids to live."
Long lasting and durable instability. Everything going as planned.
"Yup. It's brutal but the *only* way the Middle East is non-intervention, or at least, non-military intervention. Anything else is just scratching at a scab causing re-infection. It just sets up another generation of at least partially legitimate grievances against the West which will be exploited by fanatics with an axe to grind. It's not going anywhere until Western-backed wars in most Middle Eastern countries are a distant memory.

&#x200B;

If you *actually* want to solve regional problems, you'd have to see a crisis like ISIS and just plain let it happen, and keep on letting it happen- possibly for decades- until it burns itself out. It'll be incredibly costly. You'd have to ignore accusations of cowardice and selfishness, you'd also have to confine intervention to humanitarian aid and grants of refugee status, fully in the knowledge that both would be exploited mercilessly in the short to medium term. You'd have to restrict and enforce restrictions of arm sales, costing both money and influence. Things would likely get worse before they get better, but if you *didn't* do all of this it's only going to continue escalating forever.

&#x200B;

But the chances of enough Western governments having the foresight or integrity to do that for long enough is laughable, and *if* they could, they'd never sell it to the voters for long enough."

"I’m wondering why we haven’t gotten out of our “imperial laning phase” yet or even why it’s taking so long. 

We have the technology, right now, to instantly communicate with each other, anywhere on the globe. We already know there is more than enough resources and space for the entire population, and more. 

We can calculate how much trash in in the oceans. Who is contributing what to where. We can approximate how long it will take us to also run out of certain resources. Individually, we’re insignificant, and yet as a collective 7-8 billion we’ve managed to kill most insects, cause extinction to many, and even save some. We have somehow managed to heat up our current space rock in record time. 

Given that: there is more than enough space and resources for everyone to share, what are we now fighting over? Who gets to play human god on his island? It’s fucking 2019. Can we agree that we have more in common than not?

Here on reddit, a lot of my own experiences are simultaneously unique to me and I go through the same shit everyone else goes through. Desperation, depression, happiness, you name it. We post pictures of cat and dogs and we can all be happy for each other. We can educate each other on how to best take care of our own pet family. 

We all feel the same uneasiness when something goes wrong for someone else we don’t even know. That’s has to be a huge part of ptsd. People just aimlessly harming others and now they’re in mental anguish and don’t know why. They were doing everything their country stood for. 

During a huge disaster, we have strangers helping strangers because that’s what we do. We could be using our amazing adaptivity to benefit the only space ship we have and each other while trying to figure out questions we have questions to. 

I’d hate to be god king emperor to my own island. What’s the point. When my game finishes, that’s it. I’ve accomplished nothing. It’d much rather have lots of people on the same island, all recognizing we all want to live and have a place because I can’t brew beer and figure out how to do lab grown meat by myself. Let me go rock climb and you can shoot your gun at the range for all I care. Just as long as we agree on the individual is as valuable as the other instead of putting the value solely on a currency(a fictional price at that).

I just don’t get what we’re fighting over. Instead of “Hey how’s life and research on Everest?” It’s, Oh never mind, I’ve decided I want that mountain for myself to play god, so here’s a threat of annihilation. The hell is that logic. "
"The fact that 1.5k people have so far upvoted you is insanity.

What exactly has gone wrong in the fight against ISIS from the US/western side?

Civilians have died? Civilians will die in every war, especially when you're fighting in urban areas v terrorist organizations that often use human shields.

The civilian casualty ratio per bomb dropped is very low, even if you believe the claims of anti-US propagandists.

Btw, the guy advocated sending in ground troops to fight ISIS instead of using airstrikes.

Is this something you'd support? Of course not.

It's very easy to be opposed to something but a lot harder to tell what should be done differently.

""sHouLdN't bE theRe iN thE fIrsT pLacE!"" 

When a terrorist organization is about to overrun most of the middle east and assuming you'd like to stop them, this isn't a solution. 

So I ask you, what should have been done differently in the fight against ISIS?

I'm sure you're a lot smarter than US generals."
That's what they keep saying
Don't they like these drones that can kill people in seconds hovering above them to protect them?
"I think historically, you can. But then you have to help them [ build](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Japan) their [infrastructure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan) back up and stick around for at least fifty years,"
"Let's try again, just to be sure"
We just need to try to bomb them harder.
"Ya you can, just not humanely. If we carpet bombed the countries we are at war with like we did in WW2, they’d have no choice but to stop or die. The problem is we have rules of engagement now that heavily favor an isurgency/guerrilla warfaresque war."
Worked with Japan..
Well it worked for Tom Jones.  We just need to use Sex Bombs.
Of course we can. They are just playing hard to get.
*Obi Wan visible confusion meme*
The US should have either assisanated Assad or not bothered at all. Intervention just dragged the whole civil war out.

"Worked of Germany and Japan?

 Probably more the rebuilding their countries from the ruins, the wildly better quality of life and the utter terror the Soviets posed."
"Vietnamese people really like the US nowadays.

And the Japanese have a fascination for the westerners especially for anything from/about the US/UK/France."
The infrastructure was going to get destroyed either way tbf
That is why you use smart bombs.. Hits the target more often.
"And if we didn't participate, they would still be our enemies because we ""left them to die and did nothing""."
"It depends on how far back you want to go to find the point where the west shouldn't have got involved. But if you look at life for the people under Daesh, someone had to help them."
The west got involved because of Paris though. They didn’t toss a dart at a map of the middle east (this time).
Lets 'liberate' Venezuela next!
Having a fresh enemy constantly on the horizon can be very profitable both politically and financially. That's why nothing will change.
"You didn't read the article. He decries US tactics of mass bombings and the fact that ""as few as 1000 ground troops"" could have been better used to defeat a poorly equipped enemy, without destroying so much infrastructure which is fertile ground for anti Western Islamism in the local population. He decries the fact that we have the most powerful Armies in the world in the West, but dont use them for political reasons, probably because Trump fears losing appeal if he involves ground troops in Syria."
"And this argument has been used for decades, always falling on deaf ears."
I think its a bit too late for such arguments
Too late for that now. The only important question now is how move forward 
"If the argument is “If you’re not willing to do it right, don’t do it at all” then yes."
"Idk, if they're an adversary in the first place, destabilizing them may be the safest play, even if they come out as a new adversary. At least they'll have to start over in their plans to hurt us.

Of course we'd have to actually believe they're a true adversary meaning to do us harm, and not just another country for our politicians and corporate overlords to embezzle a bunch of money in. "
But then without NATO isis could have stomped all opposition in the region.
WW2/germany/japan begs to differ
IS is considered a threat to western countries. If they had been left to spread unchecked there would be major concerns about an increase in terrorism. There was at least some defence justification for getting involved this time.
"exactly, they were just fine before we invaded. there were only throwing gays from rooftops, burning people alive in cages, sex trafficing young girls and executing minorities... can't argue, they were better off before us."
"excuse me sir, Obama won a peace prize, clearly this was an invasion of peace   


Trump bad "

I think the British would disagree. 
Debatably Panama and Grenada didnt turnout that bad.
Mostly just shocked there are bridges and hospitals left to destroy in a country that’s basically been in civil war for 8 years 
"He's talking about that one specific operation to clean out the last ISIS hold-outs in Hajin. By using artillery and bombs, the civilian casualties and destruction of infrastructure are maximized while the loss of military troops are minimized. Whereas using ground troops risked a few more soldiers being hurt, but would have minimized the ""collateral damage"" significantly"
">Wasn’t the solution in Iraq or Afghanistan.

It WAS the solution in Iraq and Afghanistan though, the US just never committed from the beginning.  At the launch of Iraq Colin Powell was one of the only senior admin members who had any significant military experience and was arguing the only way to have a chance at doing Iraq right was to send an overwhelming ground force. Bush, Cheney et al were more concerned that a large troop committment would be less politically feasible so they sent a far smaller number.

This was also the reason for a lot of Afghanistan failures. So many forces were diverted to Iraq that Afghanistan just didn't get the troops needed to sustain any progress, and Afghanistan basically fell into an ongoing stalemate. Afghanistan was the war Bush should have committed too, instead he decided to invade Iraq and do a half assed job in both countries."
You need a few million boots on the ground to pacify the middle east (see how many troops there were in the middle east in WWII) and even then the hate runs so deep that as soon as the peacekeepers left they would be back fighting each other.
The west helped by arming AlQaeda and 1000s of Saudi backed islamist militants
"Citation needed that Aleppo is 'pretty much destroyed'.

I'll bet you don't even know how Aleppo was divided during the battle, but I guess you're the expert."

"For once that war had nothing to do with that. Syria produces 0.5% of the world's oil. Some claimed the whole war was about a gas pipeline, [but that is an extremely dubious claim](https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/pipelineistan-conspiracy-war-syria-has-never-been-about-gas). Plus remember it all started with a civil war when Assad started massacring peaceful protesters, way before other countries intervened. "

"Honestly, they never will. Many of the regimes there should never have been given power nor any land at all after WW2. The reason we have regimes there is due to the oil. And it all brings us to today."

"The oil is going to China, India and Korea. "
"If I were to speculate, I'd say electric cars will reduce the importance of oil, but it'll take few decades."
"I feel like many have not read the whole article - the guy is calling on for ground troops to take the lead and that by only giving them artillery and air support, we could have ended everything much more quickly. Instead we're ""drawing it out"".

Is that what people really want? Last I checked, many people did not want out soldiers fighting in the front line on this, but now we're being criticized for it? "
"> These ""boo western military"" sentiments are always light on reasoned analysis

Many are the same whiners who'd complain if we do nothing when DAESH massacres all of Syria, or do nothing while Saddam gasses the Kurds, or do nothing if Russia starts invading Ukraine again. Some are good faith isolationists. Many are just whiners.

Yeah bullshit, the chances of you using artillery on open desert against someone else using artillery on an open desert is moot.

Do people forget that both the allies and the axis BOMBED AND SHELLED THE LIVING SHIT out of civilian targets? And the world as the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army put it is urbanizing and future conflicts should expect to have MOUT as part of it.

It will stop when we no longer need oil.
"General Mattis is a smart man, his strategy helped destroy ISIS compared to Obama’s ineffective strategy of arming the various rebel factions in the hopes that one of them will take out ISIS but, these various rebel factions are just as bad as ISIS"
"Maybe i can clairify a little. You dont need boots on the ground to win wars anymore. But after the bombing has been done you need to bring in soldiers too stop looting and resurgence of enemey forces. After the enemies have been degeated, the focus of nato forces is usually too train local police and military that supports government aswell as establishing log routes for meds and food.

The horrible part is that these rebel forces always hide among civs. This is to reduce likleyhood of airstrikes, since all nato forces have pretty strict guidelines for roe, with a focus on minimizing civ casualties.. emphazis on minimizing (not avoiding completely). Military operations will always be ran on utilitarian ethics, as any other approach would lead to conceding territory.. this has been the case since large scale modern warfare was introduced. 

Im pretty sure the syrian and iraq conflict would be a terrible outcome for the average joe in those countries regardless of nato intervention or not. I think the decision to intervene, comes from an argument of ending the conflict sooner rather than later, and expediant warfare means more excessive force.. if local forces was gonna deal with this on their own it probably would be atleast a decade longer, which wouldnt necissarily be better for the region (as earlier rebuilding, means earlier economic growth). Either way its really sad, especially syria which was a pretty functional state compared to many others in the region."

And then those same countries would call for our destruction because we let them die and did nothing to help them.
"By ""saved the Syrians"" you mean enabled the deliberate gassing, starving, shelling, torture and general mass slaughter of peaceful civilians who lived in rebel territories. "
"The Syrian civil war started with Assad killings peaceful protestors, not with a Western invasion... now that Russians killed all the rebels, I bet the survivors can keep living under his dictatorship. Great outcome, right. "

You say Trump like others is just setting the ground for more violence, and you're right, but that's not his fault. It's simply a result of how the region is. Bush started wars and was rightfully criticized. Obama started some conflicts, ended others, and simply maintained others. He was criticized for all 3. Now barring a pre election invasion of Tehran or Venezuela, trump looks like he will be ending the wars we are in. And even for that he is criticized for.

"Y'know, it's likely America would have made a better empire if they'd been more imperial rather than being so half-hearted.

By that I mean America never talked about Iraq Afghanistan etc as parts of its empire, so it did the least amount possible to deal with the countries because folks back home didn't want to pay for an empire.  There was no real shame for American leaders when talking about wherever their armies were occupying.

But if they'd been more explicit with their goals, maybe they would have taken on more of a sense of responsibility with the countries and put in the money and manpower, if only because of the embarrassement.  The King/Queen of England did a lot of terrible things by proxy during the age of British empire, but at least, the whole time, they spoke about their colonies with a sense of responsibility.  It's like the middle east/near-east got the worst of both worlds: all the invasion with none of the nation building.

But all this is just random thoughts.  I've never liked American middle eastern/near east expansionism myself.  It's bizarre how much attention America gave the region in comparison to say, Africa, which also saw long periods of violence because of the legacy of colonialism and ecological failure(s)."

One, greed. *You* would hate to be god king emperor of your own island, but some people are drooling at the thought. And for every god king emperor there needs to be thousands or millions of subjects for him to crush beneath his Iron Heel.

Two, scarcity. In theory, there is (yet) enough for everyone, but there is not enough for everyone to live in luxury. Even if you don't want to be god king emperor, you probably still want a large house and your own car and probably a boat as well and maybe travel every now and then and hey you now want a living standard that isn't sustainable for eight billion people. Even if you're willing to settle for less, you know that there are plenty of people who will only grudgingly settle for living at the very edge of their means and will seek to increase their standard of living as much as possible. We're instinctively driven to seek material excess because when we evolved, ""material excess"" meant ""not having to eat all food immediately because you're constantly on the brink of starvation.""

That's what we're fighting over. I think we can get past that, but it's going to take a lot of conscious effort. If we let our instincts rule us we're stuck with ""dominate and hoard"" forever."

"Japan and Germany were radically different cultures before and after the war. They had far less racial and religious division within their countries that made it even possible to rebuild and Germany had been a respected part of European society for hundreds of years in one form or another, they just had to get back to that. The middle east is a nightmare of literally thousands of years of hate, you can't go in and pull a Japan when every person inside the country hates you and the person they are standing next to."

Not really though. Most countries that ""hate"" another country and then are subsequently left alone end up not caring about that country. People don't hate other nations unless something is egging them on.

A great example of this is Iran and the US. US citizens used to hate Iran when they were bombing shit and holding US citizens hostage in the 70s and 80s. Now, very few ""normal"" American's care and almost none of them could identify Iran on a map (or even come withing 3thousand miles of it) and young Iranians while they don't like the US don't have the white hot hatred of the US that older generations do/did."
In the future we could always choose not to fund them in the first place.

**George W. Bush** (the guy that invaded Iraq) came to an agreement with the **Iraqi government** to get U.S. forces out of Iraq by X date.

George Bush left office and Obama tried to negotitate leaving behind a small security force but the Iraqis won't make the concessions Obama viewed as necessary.

So Obama complied with the agreement GEORGE BUSH made.

And openly defying it would have been a torpedo to U.S.-Iraq relations.

The Iraqi Government clearly wanted the U.S. to get the fuck out, so we did. Remember that they were the people we were supposed to be ""liberating"""

"Yes, but right now the French are both unable to win or end the war in Syria. The French military has been on continuous active deployment ever since WWII, so when an officer, and an artillery one at that, say they need boots on the ground, then I reckon they know what they're talking about. The same issue applied to both the Afghan and Iraq occupations - not enough specialist personnel (EOD, interpreters, negotiators, etc) to protect and maintain relations with locals, and not enough soldiers and equipment to actually send after rebels/insurgents. Instead, massive contracts were doled out for PMCs to escort VIPs, and local security forces were largely concentrated in government strongholds. In the meantime undermanned and underequipped ISAF personnel conducted patrols throughout their zones of responsibility with limited support from headquarters.

It's commonly said that the US forces in Afghanistan and Iraq have done more to destabilize the area than any local power, but that's only in the context of dismantling the local militaries and firing all their personnel. When it comes to maintaining regional stability the coalition nations have done their fair share by deploying troops to their areas of responsibilities, at least as permitted by their own legislative assemblies.

More recently the West and Russia have learned that the deployment of conventional troops is too big of a political matter to even consider, so for Syria they sent in consultants and special forces to aid favoured parties, and provided long range artillery and air support to prop them up. However the French literally wrote the book on conducting 20th century counterinsurgencies, and they know better than any other nation about the importance of gaining the consensus of involved parties when it comes to conflict resolution. That is obviously not happening as the US and Russia are pitting their proxy forces against each other. With both local rebels and government forces exhausting resources and manpower, no parties are able to ensure regional stability, which is something both the US and Russia could have provided to their favoured parties from the beginning by putting boots on the ground. I don't see a withdrawal happening until the US and Russia reach a consensus on Syria, but as no troops have been committed to Syria, the resulting vacuum will attract other parties to the area, creating a perpetuating cycle of conflict.

If both the US and Russia had deployed conventional troops to the conflict, they could at least maintain security while the local government and rebel forces reach a resolution. So you can't win a war without more boots on the ground, but you just might be able to end it."
"Yeah. Specially the lower rank. The have no choice. They are under military discipline while on deployment. Like they can try lodge a protest of illegal order due to order causing them conduct a war crime, but that is high risk and often just will be ignored by higher ups.

Frankly I assume this Artillery Commander is just the tip of the iceberg, representing the whole artillery chain downwards going *we aren't supposed to be shelling civilian cities we are liberating.*

His rank is the lowest one can hope to have some chance of coming out with their post life about intact. Lower ranks speak out? They get their life steamrolled to oblivion by military discipline.

&#x200B;

Somewhere in upper chain of command, there is couple people with a lot to answer for. Also in political leadership for the oversight and what authorizations have been given. Who the hell authorized using heavy artillery against civilian occupied city, who ordered it? It wasn't the artillery. They shell what overall operational command wants shelled and follow what rules of engagement have been set for the deployment.

&#x200B;

Then again every rank does carry the burden to their ability. Lower ranks could have said ""this is war crime, that order is illegal"". However it is **extremly hard thing to do**. It will most likely ruin your life for years with legal proceedings and rounds of court martial hearings and possible court martial sentence in the end, should your complaint not prevail.

High command? They could have just **chosen** not to use heavy artillery, knowing it **will cause** civilian deaths and essentially destroy the city to ground. That is where the real blame is."

Or in the multiple interventions throughout the world such as in Cuba.

The problem in my eyes is that the American neoconservative ideology, just like neoliberalism, is a hollow ideology that does not comprehend other cultures.

Flashballs and fragmentation grenades are on the next step, and lacrymogens by grenade-launcher are in the next step, juste before using firearms.

These days they usually shoot some lacrymogens with grenade launchers in the middle of the protest when they receive the order (usually between 16:30 and 17:00), even if the yellow vests aren't violent.

You mean the person so insufferable to live under that his people rose up in revolt? That Assad?
"Easy to say when it’s not your children being subject to chemical weapons, hey? Don’t worry about it, they’re all brown anyways so who cares right?"
"No, it's the FSA. If Russia and USA did not get involved, Assad would run out of mercenaries and surrender, and FSA would not have lost enough troops to have to replace them with fundamentalists. But Russia gave him assault helicopters, tanks, IFVs, and then the rest of the world got involved. That was, mind you, before ISIS' surge."
...The guy who deployed chemical weapons in civilian populated areas?
"Do you genuinely think that ISIS and the flint water crisis are on the same level? Yikes dude.


 They literally kept/keep women as sex slaves, carried out public executions (of gay men, christians, et cetera), destroyed a number of holy sites and temples, conducted a number of suicide bombings, killed 44 and injured a couple hundred in a shooting at an airport in Turkey, detonated dozens of car bombs, displaced millions of people, executed 322 members of a Sunni tribe, and (whoops buried the lede a bit) engaged in a war that they believed would bring about the end of the world. 

If they were fighting from independence from foreign control or fighting as the result of regional or local differences that might change things a bit (not that it could excuse the fucking plethora of horrific things ISIS has done, to be clear), but they literally believe that their war was meant to bring about the apocalypse.

And if you are referring to the US support of anti Assad (non-isis aligned) rebels, well that isn't on the same fucking level either. I've seen the fucking videos of Assad snipers firing on civilians before the rebellion actually kicked off. And his father bombed an entire fucking city full of people in the 1982 Hama Massacre. Again, not remotely on the same level as the fucking flint water crisis. Christ dude, it isn't as though the US invaded Syria. The rebellion began before the US got involved.

Definitely equivalent to a county that is suffering from unsafe water as a result of local corruption. Like I completely oppose the war on terror in general, and I think it largely caused this by destabilizing the region, but supporting a rebellion and opposing ISIS is a bit of a different beast when compared to some fucking local government corruption. And it sure as hell isn't equivalent to the motherfucking flint water crisis."

So fuck off you cunts. I was pro intervention when it was my country and Brasil with a multinational coalition led by us with support from the rest of south America to liberate them from their dictatorship and misery. But now that the US wants to get in I'm staunchly against. Fuck you cunts, stay out of our land gringos."
Death squads in Central America is actually a phenomenon of the right. And what everyone is currently asking for is for new death squads to eliminate leftists in Venezuela as punishment for democratic choices that differ from outside neoliberalism.
So bombing en-masse is a better and fine strategy. Alright then.
"But why did Iran start a beef with the US in the first place? We were ignoring each other just fine, and we were even their top economic partner. Then some people who hated the US ideologies ousted their leader in a revolution and instilled a US hating leader and then started kidnapping people. That's why the US hated Iran back then.

The US then helped Iraq in their war against Iran and generally destabilized Iran in other ways to get to the point where the their actual threat to the US was much less than it was at the time of the hostage situation.

Maybe they still hate the US, but their actual threat was lessened for decades because of the destabilizing they experienced. "
"Destroying nazi germany  worked out pretty well for the world, i’d say. Not saying US military intervention has always been helpful, but sometimes its the right thing to do."

Its also partially because the US is much weaker in a few key ways than it was in the 40s and 50s, I doubt they could build a nation even if they needed to now (and even with the Soviet threat, they still were shite in Vietnam).

"Exactly. I'm not dumb enough to believe America is this great entity that fixes everyones issues by invasion, but we do actually have a record of helping SOME people. That record is why we try. Another thing people dont seem to get is that, until WW1-2, we didnt really get involved in foreign disputes by invading and trying to fix their issues. It was the ""we dont want to get involved"" attitude during WW2 that led to Pearl Harbor and our eventual involvement in the war. I cant tell you what would have happened if we hadn't gotten involved, since Russia was doing pretty good by the time we did, but the idea that we could have been next if we hadn't was just strong enough after that to push the new ""American way.""

Liberal democracy is impossible in the middle east.

2. The ongoing systematic oppression and torture of civilians over many decades by the secret police backed, funded and commanded by the Assad family."

"I didn't like what they did or endorse it by any stretch;  I totally understand that not being clear by what I posted.  What i was musing about was the fact that America has frequently pursued the interventionist/expansionist bits of imperialism without the proper nation building/stewardship-of-colonies bits that were used by previous empires as a justification for their empire (usually wrongly, but Canada wouldn't be here without it and I like being Canadian).

Invading Iraq/Afghanistan/etc or even blockading essential resources like they're doing today in Venezuela without admitting to any real responsibility for their actions has let many American presidents shirk dealing with the outcomes of their actions for decades now.  Would the US have done a better job with Iraq if they were declaring it the new Puerto Rico?  Probably not; it would likely be best if the US and Europe didn't get involbed in the region in the 1st place (though, not being an expert on the region, I'm only going off my leanings towards isolationism), but if invasion was inevitable would it have been better for Iraq if president Bush 1.0 said the whole country was Americas responsibility to rebuild?

Probably not.  Puerto Rico's a perfect example of American imperialism failing, even at its best; it's had a messy history and Trumps disinterest in it, probably because it's too Latin and won't vote for him, has proven that a single indiferrent America President is enough to leave the country in shambles.

I remember in my undergrad days, about a year after Iraq 2.0 happened, my prof argued that Bush + friends were what happened when you gave ideologues power over foreign affairs.  The narrative I leaned towards, at the time, was that it was all about oil and war profiteering.  My prof argued that most governments, as long as they were rational and/or realist, would look at what Sadam was doing and conclude that getting involved wasn't worth it, but the Neocons genuinely believed that they could spread democracy by invading the place and introducing free market ideas.  The neocons were obv wrong.  As for my prof, I don't know if his idea of what happened was right, but it was an interesting perspective on the matter and left me with the idea that a lot of bad things *could* have been done by people with the best of intentions, and that often makes them worse.

>""I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. We have definitely adopted the position at [the Peace Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919) of arguing in favour of the retention of gas as a permanent method of warfare. It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at making his eyes water by means of [lachrymatory gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tear_gas).

>I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses: gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of those affected.

What has was he talking about? Riot gas didn't exit then. The pro-Churchil website talk about chlorine and attempt to dismiss its lethality, claiming that only 4% of soldiers exposed to the gas in WWI died.

So Churchill was likely talking about chlorine, there was no other agent available. Chlorine is relatively harmless if used out in the open, people can run away. 

This is likely the exact same reason chlorine is used by Syrian government forces, it's used to domoralise and frighten the rebels rather than to kill. 

CS Gas was invented till 1927, after he wrote the 1919 memo, and it wasn't used for riot control until the 1950s-60s.

While CS Gas wasn't banned in war initially, the Chemical Weapons Convention latterly baned the use of Riot control agents i.e. CS gas in war.

>Riot control agents (RCAs) such as CS were the topic of long and heated debates during CWC negotiations. At issue were their inclusion in the treaty and the restrictions that would be imposed upon their use. In the end, a compromise was reached under which States Parties are to declare to the OPCW the RCAs they possess for law enforcement purposes. Though use is allowed for these purposes, it is prohibited as a method of warfare.

"I think a lot more of the trouble in the Middle East is the result of imperialism which arbitrarily drew borders and made up countries and then insisted that those borders had to remain after those countries established their independence. Before European domination was Ottoman imperialism, so these countries have had basically no chance to develop their own robust national discourse and destiny. Every which way they look, a powerful foreign influence is pushing it's own agenda on them. And they're not stupid; they know they've been used and abused for centuries. The cynical belief that ""nothing good can be done"" is exactly what autocrats like Assad want the rest of the world to think. ""Oh my people are all stupid barbarians, they'd all go jihad if I let 'em! Better make sure I stick around, keeping them oppressed and quiet and you keep inviting me to ski trips in Switzerland and letting me buy Maseratis!"" 

If you saw the rest of the world happy to let your dictator oppress you and let him live the life of a global super elite while your people starve and anyone who complains is tortured to death, you wouldn't think too highly of the rest of the world and their supposed moral superiority. And then, when you finally take a stand against the dictator, and foreign jihadis invade and take over a patch of ground and the West thinks now THEY might be in danger, then they send 'help' which is mostly flattening your home. Said jihadis also got their start in Iraq as a result of the US invasion and occupation. 

My essential point is, we take for granted a peaceful civil society. Europe was a bloody place for a long time before civil society liberalized and modernized and we are the benefactors of that. Most of the Middle East never got the intermediate period of liberalization, because the empires that ruled them didn't modernize and liberalize. So they went from Ottoman domination to European colonialism/mandate and then to independence. The problem with freedom is that the bastards are also free to do shit like take over in a brutal dictatorship."

"I suppose I did minimize Daesh’s crimes there. They were sadistic monsters and that should not be forgotten. There were also those for whom Daesh’s rule wasn’t as terrible. They had some supporters, and plenty of powerless people who thought that so long as they were left alone...it was ok. But my point is, they’re gone now, so people’s anger at them has no where to go. The Western military support is still around. And there are even more people who never lived under Daesh, who just went through the rest of the civil war, and whose homes became a battlefield. They might not have lost anything to Daesh, but plenty to rebels, or Assad, or to Western forces bombing them. Remember that there was a years long brutal civil war BEFORE Daesh showed up and the rest of the world decided they cared what happened in Syria. "

I say this as a person who is opposed to American hedgemony, but the US was a pretty good hedgemon for certain areas of the world for a period 1945/50-1970ish. Obviously they were pretty shit for lots of the world. But for Europe, and a select few states elsewhere, the US brought the Marshall plan, Bretton Woods, the IMF, World Bank and WTO. It put its diplomatic and economic muscle behind freer trade, economic stability, and debt relief. It also helped defend its allies well (Berlin, Korea). 

As time went on US power lessened, and US hedgemony became less benevolent. Interventions became more agressive and imperialist. Their economic strength was turned to sucking in vast amounts of capital and goods (the US used to have a huge trade surplus and send the profits of that back out to the world through aid and investment, now they have a huge trade deficit and suck the money back through an unstable financial system.*) The US is not capable of ruling benevolently anymore, but they were good once, for some.

"The devastation that happened in Vietnam wasn't the fault of a sole faction; the French and communist forces played a part in it too. For the former, they're the ones who caused the initial separation in the first place (not counting the feuding North-South dynasties that came prior) and exploited the region. For the latter, destructive policies/actions happened even after the war officially ended. I say this as a Vietnamese."
They all got immense help to rebuild and didn't have multiple groups fighting over control of the remains.
Split in half and never technically ended the war? I'm impressed if you can spin the creation of North Korea into a 'country saved' scenario.
"and also not completely destroy the city. If they really used just artillery to clear the city? There is no city. It is a pile of rubble that needs to be completely rebuilt. Anything that isn't reinforced concrete bunker would collapse under field artillery fire pretty soon. To be sure to one has cleared it completely with artillery only, one pretty much just levels the city with artillery and then walks in and goes ""job done, no more alive enemy fighter left in the whole city."""
That's true it was more a comment in regard to the US air campaign on these cities.
"Yes, pretty much this, compared a completely organized groups vs rebel with lack of technology/organization. 2 to 1 isn't a big difference. If you were to shot randomly toward 10 people, you'd have more chance hitting someone than if you were shooting randomly shooting toward 1 person. The same analogy people are thought to shot for the torso instead of aiming for the head. 

That said, the big question people should be asking themselves before entering a war is if the war is worth sending x amount of men on the ground. If people aren't ready for human loss then probably they shouldn't even think about sending artillery. As the guy said, they were reducing their own loss instead finishing the conflict as fast as possible but with probable human losses on both sides but highly reducing the amount of destruction.

"Hardly ""arguably"", its pretty much a guaranteed fact that western (mainly US) interference has caused much of the instability in the Middle East. As an area, it was never the most stable to begin with, but the US destruction of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, plus all it's efforts to force regime change in Syria (along with a number of other countries), and support for the Saudi reign of genocide in Yemen, has created Al Qaeda, ISIS, created literally millions of refugees flooding across Europe etc, caused the deaths of millions of civilians and thrown the whole area into chaos."
"Pro-Assad people often gloss over that the Assad regime has maintained one of the most efficient and brutal secret police forces in the Middle-East for decades.

A nice deep dive on how government works behind closed doors.  Actually going into detail on HOW Charlie pulled off the stuff he did.  While the movie sort of goes an inch deep on how Charlie was well liked, held a lot of IOU's, knew people, talked smooth, etc, the book explains how Charlie was, while not ""important"" on paper, was extremely intelligence, had great people skills, and very deliberately knew how to get next to the right people to have his hands on the right strings. (Example, he knew damn well the amount of influence he gained by being on both the intelligence and defense committees.  He pushed for those positions).

&nbsp;

One story I will point out from the book, as an example:  The movie makes a humorous reference in the beginning to Charlie Wilson getting a spot on the House ethics committee.  Later the movie makes passing references to Charlie having influence with (I believe) Tipper Gore and later John Murtha (the key votes he would need to keep getting money for the war.)

&nbsp;

The book explains it outright.  See, some sort of secret probe into bribery and other misdeeds by members of congress had just blown up.  Its was looking BAD.  An ethics committee was called and it seemed a bunch of people were going to get kicked out of congress.

&nbsp;

Their party wanted to step in and save them, but going to bat for people who'd been caught red handed taking bribes was career suicide.  Well, Gore realized that Charlie could be their guy.  He had a low political profile, a secure hold on his seat, and a reputation for being the free wheeling, somehow likeably shady, NON-choir boy in town.  He was the only person who could go into that committee with a ""oh come on guys, let's give them a break"" attitude, and not get roasted for it.  Like, ""sigh... that's Charlie for you""

&nbsp;

So Gore puts Charlie on the committee, with the ""kill this disciplinary stuff"" task wink wink nod unsaid.

&nbsp;

He does, and then the very powerful Gore owes him a favor.  When Murtha replaces Gore... well, guess whose job it was Charlie had been asked to save..."

">I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. We have definitely adopted the position at the Peace Conference of arguing in favour of the retention of gas as a permanent method of warfare. It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at making his eyes water by means of lachrymatory gas. I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gases: gases can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of those affected … We cannot, in any circumstances acquiesce to the non-utilisation of any weapons which are available to procure a speedy termination of the disorder which prevails on the frontier.

Gas that makes the eyes water and doesn't leave permanent damage, to be used to reduce the loss of life.

Focus being on gasses that cause '**great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror**'

"Britain declared support for the creation of a 'natural home' for the Jews from Ottoman land as early as 1917. The use of the term 'natural home' was intentional. But it was still the beginnings of international support for the idea of a Jewish state.

"The gas was used at the same time as a bombing by Assad's forces. Syria claimed that their bombs must have hit rebel gas supplies, which isn't likely, as the gas canisters would have erupted and burst, not slowly released the chemicals into surroundings as the weapons are designed, whether it's sarin or chlorine gas. The canisters were also obtained by independent UN groups. In past cases the same thing was claimed regarding use of sarin gas, but sarin gas is made of two components that are kept separate until deployment and would not present as it was found. 

A UN report has since traced back canisters and compounds to a Syrian military facility. An independent group has noted 33 cases of banned chemical weapon attacks by Syrian forces since 2013.

">Maybe you can explain why the US doesn't intervene in Saudi Arabia that sponsors state terrorism, or NK, or during the Rohingya genocide. 

""NK""

Because China supports NK and would retaliate against a U.S. or South Korean invasion, China posesses nuclear weapons and NK does as well, and North Korea could kill an absolute ass fuck of people in Seoul before their artillary and missile capabilities were eliminated.

""Saudi Arabia""

And the United States doesn't intervene in Saudi Arabia because it is a U.S. ally in the region, and the government largely sees support from the citizens who live there. Intervention in Saudi Arabia would mean invading a U.S. ally, which would not only upset other U.S. allies around the globe who could see themselves as the next Saudi Arabia, but would also likely mean engaging in an unnecessary guerilla war against the people of Saudi Arabia. I do not support the fact that the United States is an ally of SA, but understanding why the U.S. does not intervene there is simple.

""Rohingya Genocide""

To be clear, the U.S. did withdraw military assistance in Myanmar in responce to the ethnic cleansing, and has provided 300 million in aid to Rohingya refugees. I do believe, however, that it should in fact intervene in Myanmar to stop the genocide. The U.S. house of representatives has denounced the violence as a genocide as of December of last year. You must of course be aware that the Syrian civil war was ongoing for nearly three years before the U.S. intervened? There is no civil war to take advantage of in Myanmar (EDIT: To clarify, I mean a civil war on the same scale as the one which occured and is ongoing in Syria. There is of course an insurgency in Myanmar, but based on the research I have done, the rebels are not nearly as widespread.), and a war would mean pitting the U.S. military directly against the military of Myanmar and any allies.  Addionally, while the genocide is horrible and should be stopped, it is not a direct threat to the united states and european allies in the same way that ISIS is. The difference in the two situations is simple enough that a child could understand it.

>I am tired of this bullshit line about how shit got really fucked up, but at least there's this small silver lining about ""helping people"". This is just a feel good thing that people tell themselves to excuse the insanity that goes on far from home.

You do fucking realize the Syrian civil war began in 2011, and the US intervention began in 2014, right?

>But what do I know, you're the genius that discovered there's a difference between flint and ISIS, what a brilliant observation! 

You're the one who compared them, genius. There's a term for an analogy that is not equivalent, and it is ""false analogy."" False analogies are an invalid argument. That's what this is."
"Syria has long been a Russian ally, and there has been no US intervention in Syria prior to 2014. There are other very real (and generally pretty morally bad) interventions that the US engaged in around the globe, but don’t try to invent history where there is none.

Edit: unless you mean to imply that the attempted coup by the CIA in the 1950s represents a continued history of US intervention in Syria. Because honestly that would be rather silly. Since then the US has not directly intervened in Syria."
Very fair and very balanced.
"Oh very interesting. 

So you are of course aware of the fact that former Emergency Managers Jerry Ambrose and Darnell Early were both appointed by Rick Snyder(R) and were at the center of the fraud in Flint, yes? Almost everyone else involved in the fraud was a nonpartisan government official. 

And you are of course aware that republicans in Congress legally approved the intervention in Syria, right? Actually most of the opposition to intervention came from House Democrats, 40% of whom voted against it.

Ok? Without the US (and other countries' intervention) the whole Korean pennisula would have been under North Korea's control and regime.

Sure, it took many decades for South Korea to create its own democratic system, but at least they now they can live in a country where you can leave your country and you cannot be easily be executed or thrown in prision. 

Sure some might put a negative spin on the Korean war (e.g it hasn't ended, many lives lost, country split in half) but if I was given two options for the future of Korea:

(1) The whole pennisula being ruled vicious communist dictatorship.

(2) Only half of it being ruled by a communist system whilst the other half was a capitalist dicatorship (later to become a democratic system)

Which is one of the more heinous parts of the USA drone campaign. Technology now allows waging war without putting your own side at risk. Which means trigger happy leadership. *well our side isn't in harms way, so why not, it's just munitions and money*. Of course this requires the leadership is callous enough (And HOLY FUCK most of world leadership seems to be, which is so fucking depressing) to employ these kind of tactics and just not care about civilian casualties and civilian damage. aka being ok with murders happening. Since killing civilian not involved in fighting effort isn't fighting a war, it is a murder.

&#x200B;

On top of that they are really bad and imprecise. It would be one thing if it was Sci-Fi laser gun taking out one leader 5 miles high. It isn't. One of the most surprising things about the drone campaign is, that the drones aren't actually CSI read text of news paper good. Some of the operators after leaving have come forth and told *we have no idea who we are shooting. The long range drones fly so high and have so small optics it makes stuff like seeing the faces clearly and identifying near impossible outside of most perfect circumstances. So it's mostly the cell phone locates here and that guy has a gun or well the guy is next to a car we think is theirs or that house is their meeting place and he went in. Or he wear the basic colored clothes and style we think target wears.*

If leadership aren't willing to soldiers on the line and boots on the ground.... Think twice, if the goal is really worth it. Specially in this kind of unclear insurgency stuff. It would be one thing to drone a radar, AT gun or so on sitting on a hill top against clear military. But houses and cars in the middle of civilians? Are you nuts.

&#x200B;

Plus bombing insurgency to death just doesn't work. Not unless one goes genocidal (not suggesting this by the way, just observation). Kill the ""leader""? two new ones will prop up. Kill couple fighters and their AKs? They get two more next day. World isn't running out of cheap AKs and explosives anytime soon.

&#x200B;

Specially, if one hurts civilians, since then the civilians will join the insurgents or start a separate insurgency against whoever killed their friend and family.

&#x200B;

This kind of insurgency dealing takes a) full backing of local civil population, you can't kill insurgency or resistance if locals back it. (unless genocide) b) surgical precision and long time aka boots on the ground patrolling day after day and being really careful only to take out insurgents and not harm civilians. c) Oh did i mention, LOCAL BACKING. You can't kill and insurgency, if one is foreign occupier. It takes legitimacy in the eyes of locals. So either one is local or has full backing of local society."

>The researchers said they based their findings on witness statements and post-attack analysis, including reports of the effects from the apparent chemical agents and how the weapons were delivered on the attack sites.

How did they get to the sites during wartime? Why do witness testamonies matter? Also, all these claims took place BEFORE Assad gave his weapons to the IAEA. Russia is the most likely candidate in these pre-2013 attacks. But the coincidence being that, when Obama mentioned chemical weapons, they suddenly began being used. Not at the peak of ISIS power and invasions, not when assad’s Military was on the brink, but well after ISIS began losing.

"That was not what I was getting at (the Nazi connection) - but to pick up your argument: after using gas to murder people on an industrial scale in WWI (granted, all sides did it and were very successful with diverse means besides gas.).

What is the real issue, is that chemical weapons of all kinds (including tear gas) were banned for MILITARY use after the experiences of WWI. These limitations do not in anyway apply to the use of gas on your own civilian population for policing - either in the form of tear gas against demonstrators / insurgents or using gas chambers to execute criminals (which the US did up to 1999).

Which brings us to the kinda bizarre situation that using tear gas on enemy troops is an internationally punishable war crime while you are legally fine using the nastiest gas you can cook up for executions as long as the death penalty is legal in your country (Well not quite, you would probably run into trouble with the UN convention against torture if you did sign that).

It's quite likely that if England had enfranchised white property owners and sent American MPs to London in 1770, Lexington and Concord never happens.

Similarly, the Soviets didn't lose power in 1936 when millions were starved to death and millions more shipped to exile and hard labor, but in the 1980s when a relatively comfortable population was given some increased freedom. Even the French Revolution, though the story tends to center around let them eat cake, was lead by relatively wealthy, educated professionals who read Rousseau and swore an oath at a tennis court.

The narrative pushed by the west that only the Syrian government has access to chemical weapons, and that only they are responsible for chemical attacks is demonstrably false.

The article you cite which says 33 cases of banned chemical weapons were noted erroneously suggests that they were done by the Syrian forces, IE: the government.

I mean, in a video game, that is literally considered hacking.  

Of course they told him to stop, and of course they refloated the fleet in the sim so they could actually try to learn something without General Fucknuts using tactics that weren't even supported by the simulation and getting stupidly unrealistic advantages all while the simulation was choking on trying to understand a real-world setup that was completely forced, had no workup to it like a fleet would have sailing into the area, and had no human interaction to override the incorrect settings because the simulation let it all happen prior to anyone knowing.

On top of that, the simulator that ran the ship's defenses wasn't functioning properly due to the fact that the engagement was happening in the wrong area so it was turned off. Whoops. Oh, and the Blue Force had no idea this had happened until after the fact.

Van Riper goes on a media rampage about how technology is bad and the only sure fire way to defeat the USN is to use tiny boats and planes that can't actually use the weapons the computer said it could in the model.

Also his famous WWII style scouting and communications were essentially hacks because they could move instantly and communicate with perpect precision over distances not represented by physics... because the simulation model framework hadn't been written to account for them.  I mean, in a video game, that is literally considered hacking.

No, no we don't. I'll tell you why: Because its not consistent.

I think that is borne out by what this French officer writes, that the results of a western ""liberation"" is devastation. Nor do we intervene in many places that are worse than Syria, so that too makes a lie of that excuse. If the purpose was too help people, then dropping bombs would be a measure of last resort rather than the go to solution."

Not having battle tactics used in WW2 not written into a simulation is beyond poor oversight especially considering the limited amount of technology red force had access to it makes them more lightly to be used, it makes the entire thing worthless as it might as well be a scripted chain of events, the fact the simulation choked is really not the Generals fault, he obviously saw a design flaw and went all in.

Rice farms, stored rice and boats were actively destroyed by the British army there, with the famine of the Bengalis being considered just incidental to denying the Japanese food. It was ridiculously explicitly man-made and denying it is frankly insane, it permanently changed the way food was handled all over India."

Again, maybe the US isnt soley responsible for those events, but they did influence them, to what degree is up for debate, but the fact that the US has a history of inducing violent regime change is not.

The US has no business doing these things and the effect of supporting these movements has time and again resulted in massive bloodshed and destabilization.

>The United States didn't start the Arab Spring and they didn't start the Syrian Civil War.

This does not justify meddling in them and we will never know how much different things would have been without that interference."
"The US -did- actually have a lot to do with the start of the Arab Spring, but it was far more indirectly than you'd think.

The initial protests in the Arab Spring were largely in response to rising prices of grains - governments across the region generally subsidized the provision of grains, but the price rose to a point that the governments had trouble maintaining the previous level of subsidy. That's what sparked the initial wave of protests; these tended to snowball once they got going, except in those countries with enough budgetary room to buy off their constituents.

Why'd the price of grain go up? Because the US was producing fewer grains, because we'd recently implemented a program to add ethanol to gasoline - ostensibly because it would assist in fighting global warming, though pretty much everyone on both sides knew that it wasn't actually of any help in that respect, and ultimately it came down to being a giveaway to corn farmers in politically-advantaged areas.

So, in a very real sense, what tipped over that particular anthill was US environmental policy, as modified by US domestic politics. Had we not decided that it was our environmental duty to grow corn and then set fire to it, the price of grains may not have increased, the Tunisian protests wouldn't have started the avalanche, and all sorts of other things may or may not have resulted from there.

Unintended consequences, right? Nobody was thinking ""man, what we are doing for our environmental policy is going to cause the declaration of an Islamic state in a weakened Syria."" Hell, if we'd tried to do that, doubtless it wouldn't have worked."

On the other hand, Saudi Arabia cut of diplomatic ties with Qatar over their funding Nusra and related Jihadi groups, so did the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, and Jordan. Saudi Arabia and UAE came close to invading Qatar in 2017 over the crisis, the invasion was stopped by US diplomatic pressure. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have instead resorted to imposting an economic blockade on Qatar over their support of Jihadi groups.

Saudi Arabia helped set up and support Jaish al Islam and Ahrar al-Sham in September 2013 in an attempt to counter the growing strength of al Nusra.

Point being the uprising was never about values such as liberty or democracy. It was only about balance of power between Alawites/the Al-Assad dynasty and the islamists. *Free Syrian Army* was just a convenient alias for the islamists to gain Western sympathy that was successfully translated into military assistance.

We shouldn't be disingenuous though. It wasn't the U.S.'s intention to arm islamists or desabilize Syria. They just wanted someone to fight their proxy-war against the Russian-friendly Assad. And they thought it would be a quick and easy victory. They even [turned down an offer from Russia to have Assad step down in 2012!](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/west-ignored-russian-offer-in-2012-to-have-syrias-assad-step-aside) They were convinced their rebels would win the war, and then they'd be able to install their own proxy with no Russian involvement.

Under a Northern-led government, it would've likely been more comparable to where Vietnam is now (albeit Vietnam's communist party was smart enough to adopt capitalism and free trade and Vietnam is comparatively more free than North Korea).

"> Did they somehow expect that there would be no resistance to america imposing a new state?

Interestingly enough, the ""New State"" was the big problem.  ""New Management"" would have been fine.  To put it probably way too simply, after ousting Saddam and Co., the majority of military and government would have been fine showing up to work under the new interim government and working back to life as semi-usual.  In many places this is what was already starting to happen.

BUT, against the advice of a lot of military leaders on the ground, the Administration at the top decide on ""De-baathification"".  If you held any meaningful rank in the Baath party, you weren't trusted to be part of the new gov.  

Problem:  In the OLD gov, you HAD to be a Baathist.  So they pretty much fired everyone from the top.  End result, you've 

A. Told all the wealthy and powerful people in the region, ""So look under the allied reconstruction plan, you are all now powerless and unemployed.""  And you wonder why these guys decided to start an insurgency?  Basic fact. The rich and powerful do NOT want to become the poor and powerless.  They will get ruthless to avoid that.

B. Since you've barred all them from the gov, where's your talent pool? You've taken all the people with connection, training, military leadership experience, and decided you CAN'T hire them.  So not only have you created a big old angry desperate ex military cadre trying to force you out, but you're relegated yourself to hiring teachers and truck drivers as your new generals.

The real shame was that Al-Qaeda assassinated [Ahmad Shah Massoud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Shah_Massoud) a day before 9/11. So we got stuck with Hamid Karzai and by extension his brother [Ahmed Wali Karzai](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/02/us-karzai-half-brother-wikileaks) to try and establish trust and confidence in a central afghani government.

"Well we have seen state building work. West Germany, East Germany, the soviet satellite staes in eastern europe, japan, austria after WW2 all were to some extent state buliding exercises though with a lot more favourable baseline and signficantly larger (the three US army branches had a combined 15 million men in 1945, with the army at a bit over 8 million ment hte biggest branch, the red army had 12 million soldiers at that point)

The thing is it is just not politically viable to commit that amount of ressources to afghanistan, to fully control the country and build a state. There is also no willingness to enter a real partnership and to respect the religious and cultural structer of Afghanistan and importantly there is also no lost war by Afghanistan that you could use as base for reeducation. 

I think if you were to go into Afghanistan wiht half a million men and large scale propaganda effort and economic aid it would have been possible to create a state there, but that is both hard to sell at home and very expensive. There is no red threat that gave a reason to rehabilitate West Germany in Afghanistan. It is also much simpler from a cultural point for the US to understand germany because german culture is much closer to american culture than Afghan culture. 

I feel like in Afghanistan you have some underlying even if just subconcious idea that western culture is somehow inherently superior to Afghan culture, but if you want to go into that you would have to go into full on suppression in Afghanistan wiht no real prospect to build much else than a colonial state, which is politically unsustainable.

But when facing just regular ""old-fashioned"" parents that would be reluctant to send their children to ""western teachings"", it is possible to just convince them to send their children to schools that will just teach them objective technical skills. Math, physics, chemistry, biology...

"No, Assad isn't loved because he is in power democratically, the proof that Assad is loved by a large segment of the population is due to the fight or die attitude so many Syrians showed for his cause from 2012-2015.

The attitudes of the men in SAA held Aleppo, Dier Ez Zor, the Al-Tabqa, Abu Duhur & Kuweires airbases, Nubul & Zahra, al-Fu'ah and Kafriya, Al Kindi hospital, shows popular support for the regime's cause. In each of these places, the SAA & civilians literally fought to the death under siege *for years*, with food and ammunition only arriving via air drop. They weren't ""Assadist flunkies"" trying to cling to their power, they were poor people (elites become chair officers) literally showing their support by refusing to surrender in the face of absolute death. And of course, the defenders of Tabqa, Abu Duhur, Al Kindi, were eventually overrun and slaughtered, but these *conscripts* (not mukhabarat or rich Damascene elites) of all religions and classes did not accept any of their many offers of surrender, it is absolute proof of the facts of popular support for Assad. 

When Kuweires was saved, which was under siege from 2013-2015, there were only 300 air cadets left alive, out of an original 1100. We are talking about young 18-20 something conscripts, teenagers who were only in the service for a few weeks. Why the hell did they fight so hard, why didn't they accept any term of surrender, especially during the period from 2013-2014 where the SAA was at it's weakest, losing Idlib, losing ground in Damascus, losing Tabqa, losing Division 13 in Raqqa, etc? Why didn't they (or couldn't they) surrender and leave for Turkey, when they were only young enlisted men earning small salaries, not 30-40 year old Mukhabarat/Shabiha mob boss millionaires & their employees?

Areas across Syria like Latakia and Tartus for a while faced a shortage of young men, families were giving every one of their sons to various militias and the regular army. The NDF, who *could not be deployed outside of their home region*, and served as home defense, grew to hundreds of thousands of men.

Assad is loved because millions of Syrians genuinely believe and fear that they will be slaughtered to a man, like in Kessab. And if this were not a legitimate fear to be had, then why on Earth did the rebels besiege  al-Fu'ah and Kafriya? The defenders of those towns were the inhabitants, not soldiers, the only goal was to kill all of them, because the inhabitants were Shiites.

During the last rebel Hama offensive of 2017, we saw the Sunni inhabitants of Qomhana form the Tigers of Qamahana, repelling the HTS assault on their town.

In 2015, the Guardians of the Dawn was formed of Christian civilians to defend their towns in the al Ghab and Hama plains from rebel attacks. Why don't they just let the rebels advance past them to Hama? Why do poor Christian farmers arm themselves in defense of a 'tyrant'? In general, why have so many towns formed their own pro-government defensive militias, instead of just letting the rebels get Assad, who only rules 'because of a small elite that keeps everyone else in line?'

It is undeniable that many tribes and families have pledged their support to the government, otherwise they would have not survived the 2012 Battle of Damascus, nor would Government held Aleppo survive a state of siege until Operation Canopus Star. Sections of every sector of Syrian society has shown their support for the government, we are talking about entire tribal towns miles from the closest government installation, fathers and sons, resisting rebels at the threat of beheading, when they could have just let the rebels march on, deposing the 'tyrant'.

And I'm willing to bet that none of these names I'm throwing at you mean anything to you.

Just understand that the world is not black and white, and nearly every autocrat in history has had wide sections of society support him. You cannot have a 'civil war' without both sides having WIDE support, otherwise it would just be Assad, his circle of nepotistic millionaires, and some Shabiha versus the entire country. The SAA doesn't even get paid well, in fact, rebels get paid for more since they're backed by the rich gulf states. We're talking $300 USD a month, vs maybe 1500 Syrian pounds."

"We didn’t have the opportunity to “occupy it like Germany”. The ball was in their court and they decided to kill eachother and kill our troops, where as the Germans did not. The was nothing about the style of the occupation of Germany which foreclosed the option of an armed insurgency or of sectarian violence. The Germans chose to accept their occupation and they had no preexisting factions within Germany that were itching for a fight against eachother."

It was an illegal war and several war crimes took place during it. That's pretty established. Do you want to continue deflecting or address the point?
"It was called denazification and was stopped because exiling the government as a whole and replacing it with people who weren’t part of the nazi party would have led to a nonfunctional government, because the state basically forced the citizens to join the party to be able to access necessities for their own lives. Turns out, that was the right move, and taking action through purely ideological thought is a bad thing."
"I simply do not think that NGOs would have the ressources required to pull this off, but of course cooperating with NGOs in such a scenario seems like a good idea.

The real problem is that you are going into a country with entrenched ideology and you have to break that ideology somehow.

I think a reasonable strategies to do that would have been at the same time economic developent, but also appealing on religious grounds. 

Sure westerners might not believe in Islam, but they still believe in Allah, Christianity at its core is very similar to Islam, both as Abrahamic religions. 

I think you would have needed to have an occupation government for much longer to allow for a peaceful transition. Show the people that they have it better under the occupation than beforehand and they will stay peaceful. 

The thing is that this would be politically unpopoular with the more radical proponents of a crusade style invasion because it doesn't go against Islam, it is not as vengeful and with the more liberal minded people because itis somewhat colonialistic in its approach.

It is also of course much more expensive to maintain military occupation that long and you need much larger garrisons.

"If there had been more troops on the ground, it would have been possible. It was never the plan to occupy in that fashion, so yes, there never was an opportunity.

And you'd be surprised. There were a lot of extreme political factions in Europe at the time. The British actually feared a civil war in France after the war between far left and far right political groups. If the German occupation had been a lot more light touch, especially in the devastated state it was in, a lot of nasty things could have happened."

No denazification wasn't stopped. It was just not carried out thoroughly because the volume of cases was just far too large. Also as I said it was fairly lenient in that a large chunk of members of the Nazi party could continue. That said if you were a high ranking nazi your political career was mostly over after the war

"That’s interesting about France, never heard about that. The German/Iraq comparison just doesn’t work, the people in these countries are not a blank slate sitting there waiting to have their history written by the US. The Iraqis violently resisted occupation, the Germans did not. The Germans has a single ethnic state that wanted unification, Iraqis had a multi ethnic and multi religious state barely contained by the iron fist of the now disposed of peacekeeping dictator. The idea that the largest deciding factor in their fate was the manner of occupation doesn’t have any logical backing. Additionally youd have to establish exactly what you’d consider the distinguishing characteristics of the occupations, and establish that this distinction could have been overcome somehow."

"[“As denazification was deemed ineffective and counterproductive by the Americans, they did not oppose the plans of the West German chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, to end the denazification efforts. Adenauer's intention was to switch government policy to reparations and compensation for the victims of Nazi rule (Wiedergutmachung), stating that the main culprits had been prosecuted.[94] In 1951 several laws were passed, ending the denazification. Officials were allowed to retake jobs in the civil service, with the exception of people assigned to Group I (Major Offenders) and II (Offenders) during the denazification review process.”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification) yeah no shit the people mainly responsible for the atrocities were fucked, but even after the end of denazification there were mass pardons, and eventually the FDR was 77 percent ran by former party members."

Comprehension.
"So a single photo op. Do you have any evidence everybody hated the Americans coming in from the get go? From what I can tell by the story, many were just taking advantage of the chaotic situation, something that would have been prevented with a stronger occupation."
"If you focus on ethnicity and religion then no, you can't make the comparison. But political and nationalistic divisions can foster just as much violence, Europe's bloody history is testament to that. Germany hasn't always been as united as it is now. I'd argue that the strong occupation was part of what encouraged unity.

As I said before, the wide scale violent resistance wasn't immediate, and anyway if we'd gone in with enough troops to assume total control I don't think they  wouldn't have been able to resist on a large scale. The religious fanatics may never have been able to wield so much influence as there would be no power vacuum.

I agree it's not easy to make the comparison because it's hard to establish cause and effect, and we can't say for certain one way or the other because no two countries are the same and you can't try both methods on one nation. So I respect your opinion and I can understand where you are coming from. But personally I think a stronger occupation would have gone a long way into creating a more stable Iraq, one with a gradual establishment of moderate secular government. No guarantee, of course, but a lot more likely I think."

"The USA, BRITAIN, FRANCE, SPAIN, NEW ZELAND are 5 countries that use a mixed economy more on the free market side. These free markets have competition between businesses, and this competition causes an equilibrium process based on supply of production materials, the amout of materials they produce, and the quantity demanded for said product.

The difference is when it comes to private health insurance, having a universal healthcare program causes problems due to the exponentially lower price. Such as the fact doctors will get paid less and it also causes pharmaceutical prices to increase. Just like how the market price changes if minimum wage was increased, if all healthcare prices dropped because of a healthcare plan, you can be sure to see the overall prices to rise to make up for the loss in profit.

There are unseen problems related to the economy whenever implementing socialist bills. I'd like to see everyone have affordable healthcare, but I dont think that the government would do a good job of orchestrating this."
"So let's see. 

Lybia interfered against government - mess.

One thing too is that with technology we can’t quite just go apples to apples and compare troop levels.

"Hasn't failed yet. Demand for healthcare is high, supply of doctors, and effective drugs are low. Most of the price that your paying for drugs gets put into research for more efficient and safer treatment. This is why the US is the world leader in healthcare R&D.

R&d = research and development. Aka innovation

So to day that the US healthcare industry has failed is just wrong."
"It hasn't failed? 1000s of people go bankrupt every year, millions have no insurance, 10s of millions don't visit doctor unless it is serious because they can't afford the high deductible level.
